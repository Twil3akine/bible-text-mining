dead
tobias of the tribe and city of nephtali which is in the upper
parts of galilee above naasson beyond the way that leadeth to the west
having on the right hand the city of sephet
when he was made captive in the days of salmanasar king of the
but every day gave all he could get to his brethren his fellow
captives that were of his kindred
and when he was younger than any of the tribe of nephtali yet did
he no childish thing in his work
moreover when all went to the golden calves which jeroboam king of
and went to jerusalem to the temple of the lord and there adored
the lord god of israel offering faithfully all his firstfruits and his
tithes
so that in the third year he gave all his tithes to the proselytes
and strangers
these and such like things did he observe when but a boy according
to the law of god
but when he was a man he took to wife anna of his own tribe and
had a son by her whom he called after his own name
and from his infancy he taught him to fear god and to abstain
from all sin
and when by the captivity he with his wife and his son and all his
tribe was come to the city of ninive
when all ate of the meats of the gentiles he kept his soul and
never was defiled with their meats
and because he was mindful of the lord with all his heart god
gave him favour in the sight of salmanasar the king
and he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would with liberty
to do whatever he had a mind
he therefore went to all that were in captivity and gave them
wholesome admonitions
and when he was come to rages a city of the medes and had ten
talents of silver of that with which he had been honoured by the king
and when amongst a great multitude of his kindred he saw gabelus
in want who was one of his tribe taking a note of his hand he gave him
the aforesaid sum of money
but after a long time salmanasar the king being dead when
children of israel
tobias daily went among all his kindred and comforted them and
distributed to every one as he was able out of his goods
he fed the hungry and gave clothes to the naked and was careful
to bury the dead and they that were slain
and when king sennacherib was come back fleeing from judea by
reason of the slaughter that god had made about him for his blasphemy
and being angry slew many of the children of israel tobias buried their
bodies
but when it was told the king he commanded him to be slain and
took away all his substance
but tobias fleeing naked away with his son and with his wife lay
concealed for many loved him
but after fortyfive days the king was killed by his own sons
and tobias returned to his house and all his substance was
restored to him
permission for manifestation of his patience
but after this when there was a festival of the lord and a good
dinner was prepared in tobiass house
he said to his son go and bring some of our tribe that fear god
to feast with us
and when he had gone returning he told him that one of the
children of israel lay slain in the street and he forthwith leaped up
from his place at the table and left his dinner and came fasting to
the body
and taking it up carried it privately to his house that after the
sun was down he might bury him cautiously
and when he had hid the body he ate bread with mourning and fear
remembering the word which the lord spoke by amos the prophet your
festival days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning
so when the sun was down he went and buried him
now all his neighbours blamed him saying once already commandment
was given for thee to be slain because of this matter and thou didst
scarce escape the sentence of death and dost thou again bury the dead
but tobias fearing god more than the king carried off the bodies
of them that were slain and hid them in his house and at midnight
buried them
now it happened one day that being wearied with burying he came
to his house and cast himself down by the wall and slept
and as he was sleeping hot dung out of a swallows nest fell upon
his eyes and he was made blind
now this trial the lord therefore permitted to happen to him that
an example might be given to posterity of his patience as also of holy
for whereas he had always feared god from his infancy and kept
his commandments he repined not against god because the evil of
blindness had befallen him
but continued immoveable in the fear of god giving thanks to god
all the days of his life
for as the kings insulted over holy job so his relations and
kinsmen mocked at his life saying
princes in their respective territories
where is thy hope for which thou gavest alms and buriedst the
dead
but tobias rebuked them saying speak not so
for we are the children of saints and look for that life which
now anna his wife went daily to weaving work and she brought home
what she could get for their living by the labour of her hands
whereby it came to pass that she received a young kid and
brought it home
and when her husband heard it bleating he said take heed lest
perhaps it be stolen restore ye it to its owners for it is not lawful
for us either to eat or to touch any thing that cometh by theft
at these words his wife being angry answered it is evident the
hope is come to nothing and thy alms now appear
and with these and other such like words she upbraided him
heard by god and the angel raphael is sent to relieve them
then tobias sighed and began to pray with tears
saying thou art just o lord and all thy judgments are just and
all thy ways mercy and truth and judgment
and now o lord think of me and take not revenge of my sins
neither remember my offences nor those of my parents
for we have not obeyed thy commandments therefore are we delivered
to spoil and to captivity and death and are made a fable and a
reproach to all nations amongst which thou hast scattered us
and now o lord great are thy judgments because we have not done
according to thy precepts and have not walked sincerely before thee
and now o lord do with me according to thy will and command my
spirit to be received in peace for it is better for me to die than to
live
now it happened on the same day that sara daughter of raguel in
servant maids
there were two cities in media of the name of rages raguel dwelt in one
of them and gabelus in the other
because she had been given to seven husbands and a devil named
so when she reproved the maid for her fault she answered her
saying may we never see son or daughter of thee upon the earth thou
murderer of thy husbands
wilt thou kill me also as thou hast already killed seven
husbands at these words she went into an upper chamber of her house
and for three days and three nights did neither eat nor drink
but continuing in prayer with tears besought god that he would
deliver her from this reproach
and it came to pass on the third day when she was making an end of
her prayer blessing the lord
she said blessed is thy name o god of our fathers who when thou
hast been angry wilt shew mercy and in the time of tribulation
forgivest the sins of them that call upon thee
to thee o lord i turn my face to thee i direct my eyes
i beg o lord that thou loose me from the bond of this reproach
or else take me away from the earth
thou knowest o lord that i never coveted a husband and have
kept my soul clean from all lust
never have i joined myself with them that play neither have i
made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness
but a husband i consented to take with thy fear not with my
lust
and either i was unworthy of them or they perhaps were not worthy
of me because perhaps thou hast kept me for another man
for thy counsel is not in mans power
but this every one is sure of that worshippeth thee that his
life if it be under trial shall be crowned and if it be under
tribulation it shall be delivered and if it be under correction it
shall be allowed to come to thy mercy
for thou art not delighted in our being lost because after a
storm thou makest a calm and after tears and weeping thou pourest in
joyfulness
be thy name o god of israel blessed for ever
at that time the prayers of them both were heard in the sight of
the glory of the most high god
and the holy angel of the lord raphael was sent to heal them
both whose prayers at one time were rehearsed in the sight of the lord
telleth him of money he had lent to a friend
therefore when tobias thought that his prayer was heard that he
might die he called to him tobias his son
and said to him hear my son the words of my mouth and lay them
as a foundation in thy heart
when god shall take my soul thou shalt bury my body and thou
shalt honour thy mother all the days of her life
for thou must be mindful what and how great perils she suffered for
thee in her womb
and when she also shall have ended the time of her life bury her
by me
and all the days of thy life have god in thy mind and take heed
thou never consent to sin nor transgress the commandments of the lord
our god
give alms out of thy substance and turn not away thy face from any
poor person for so it shall come to pass that the face of the lord
shall not be turned from thee
according to thy ability be merciful
if thou have much give abundantly if thou have little take care
even so to bestow willingly a little
for thus thou storest up to thyself a good reward for the day of
necessity
for alms deliver from all sin and from death and will not suffer
the soul to go into darkness
alms shall be a great confidence before the most high god to all
them that give it
take heed to keep thyself my son from all fornication and
beside thy wife never endure to know a crime
never suffer pride to reign in thy mind or in thy words for from
it all perdition took its beginning
if any man hath done any work for thee immediately pay him his
hire and let not the wages of thy hired servant stay with thee at all
see thou never do to another what thou wouldst hate to have done
to thee by another
eat thy bread with the hungry and the needy and with thy garments
cover the naked
lay out thy bread and thy wine upon the burial of a just man and
do not eat and drink thereof with the wicked
seek counsel always of a wise man
bless god at all times and desire of him to direct thy ways and
that all thy counsels may abide in him
i tell thee also my son that i lent ten talents of silver while
thou wast yet a child to gabelus in rages a city of the medes and i
have a note of his hand with me
now therefore inquire how thou mayst go to him and receive of him
the foresaid sum of money and restore to him the note of his hand
fear not my son we lead indeed a poor life but we shall have
many good things if we fear god and depart from all sin and do that
which is good
shape of a man undertaketh this office
then tobias answered his father and said i will do all things
father which thou hast commanded me
but how i shall get this money i cannot tell he knoweth not me
and i know not him what token shall i give him nor did i ever know the
way which leadeth thither
then his father answered him and said i have a note of his hand
with me which when thou shalt shew him he will presently pay it
but go now and seek thee out some faithful man to go with thee
for his hire that thou mayst receive it while i yet live
then tobias going forth found a beautiful young man standing
girded and as it were ready to walk
and not knowing that he was an angel of god he saluted him and
said from whence art thou good young man
but he answered of the children of israel and tobias said to him
and he answered i know it and i have often walked through all the
ways thereof and i have abode with gabelus our brother who dwelleth at
and tobias said to him stay for me i beseech thee till i tell
these same things to my father
then tobias going in told all these things to his father upon
which his father being in admiration desired that he would come in unto
him
so going in he saluted him and said joy be to thee always
and tobias said what manner of joy shall be to me who sit in
darkness and see not the light of heaven
and the young man said to him be of good courage thy cure from
and tobias said to him canst thou conduct my son to gabelus at
thy hire
and the angel said to him i will conduct him thither and bring
him back to thee
and tobias said to him i pray thee tell me of what family or
what tribe art thou
and raphael the angel answered dost thou seek the family of him
thou hirest or the hired servant himself to go with thy son
but lest i should make thee uneasy i am azarias the son of the
great ananias
himself by the name of the man whom he personated azarias in hebrew
signifies the help of god and ananias the grace of god
and tobias answered thou art of a great family but i pray thee
be not angry that i desired to know thy family
and the angel said to him i will lead thy son safe and bring him
to thee again safe
and tobias answering said may you have a good journey and god
be with you in your way and his angel accompany you
then all things being ready that were to be carried in their
journey tobias bade his father and his mother farewell and they set
out both together
and when they were departed his mother began to weep and to say
i wish the money for which thou hast sent him had never been
for our poverty was sufficient for us that we might account it as
riches that we saw our son
and tobias said to her weep not our son will arrive thither
safe and will return safe to us and thy eyes shall see him
for i believe that the good angel of god doth accompany him and
doth order all things well that are done about him so that he shall
return to us with joy
at these words his mother ceased weeping and held her peace
him reserveth the heart the gall and the liver for medicines they
lodge at the house of raguel whose daughter sara tobias is to marry
she had before been married to seven husbands who were all slain by a
devil
and tobias went forward and the dog followed him and he lodged
the first night by the river of tigris
and he went out to wash his feet and behold a monstrous fish came
up to devour him
and tobias being afraid of him cried out with a loud voice
saying sir he cometh upon me
and the angel said to him take him by the gill and draw him to
thee and when he had done so he drew him out upon the land and he
began to pant before his feet
then the angel said to him take out the entrails of this fish and
lay up his heart and his gall and his liver for thee for these are
necessary for useful medicines
and when he had done so he roasted the flesh thereof and they
took it with them in the way the rest they salted as much as might
serve them till they came to rages the city of the medes
then tobias asked the angel and said to him i beseech thee
brother azarias tell me what remedies are these things good for which
thou hast bid me keep of the fish
and the angel answering said to him if thou put a little piece
of its heart upon coals the smoke thereof driveth away all kind of
devils either from man or from woman so that they come no more to
them
things a virtue against those proud spirits to make them who affected
to be like the most high subject to such mean corporeal creatures as
instruments of his power
and the gall is good for anointing the eyes in which there is a
white speck and they shall be cured
and tobias said to him where wilt thou that we lodge
and the angel answering said here is one whose name is raguel a
near kinsman of thy tribe and he hath a daughter named sara but he
hath no son nor any other daughter beside her
all his substance is due to thee and thou must take her to wife
ask her therefore of her father and he will give her thee to
wife
then tobias answered and said i hear that she hath been given to
seven husbands and they all died moreover i have heard that a devil
killed them
now i am afraid lest the same thing should happen to me also and
whereas i am the only child of my parents i should bring down their old
age with sorrow to hell
before the coming of christ
then the angel raphael said to him hear me and i will shew thee
who they are over whom the devil can prevail
for they who in such manner receive matrimony as to shut out god
from themselves and from their mind and to give themselves to their
lust as the horse and mule which have not understanding over them the
devil hath power
but thou when thou shalt take her go into the chamber and for
three days keep thyself continent from her and give thyself to nothing
else but to prayers with her
and on that night lay the liver of the fish on the fire and the
devil shall be driven away
but the second night thou shalt be admitted into the society of
the holy patriarchs
and the third night thou shalt obtain a blessing that sound
children may be born of you
and when the third night is past thou shalt take the virgin with
the fear of the lord moved rather for love of children than for lust
that in the seed of abraham thou mayst obtain a blessing in children
and they went in to raguel and raguel received them with joy
and raguel looking upon tobias said to anna his wife how like is
this young man to my cousin
and when he had spoken these words he said whence are ye young
men our brethren
but they said we are of the tribe of nephtali of the captivity of
and raguel said to them do you know tobias my brother and they
said we know him
and when he was speaking many good things of him the angel said to
father
and raguel went to him and kissed him with tears and weeping upon
his neck said a blessing be upon thee my son because thou art the
son of a good and most virtuous man
and anna his wife and sara their daughter wept
and after they had spoken raguel commanded a sheep to be killed
and a feast to be prepared and when he desired them to sit down to
dinner
tobias said i will not eat nor drink here this day unless thou
first grant me my petition and promise to give me sara thy daughter
now when raguel heard this he was afraid knowing what had
happened to those seven husbands that went in unto her and he began to
fear lest it might happen to him also in like manner and as he was in
suspense and gave no answer to his petition
the angel said to him be not afraid to give her to this man for
to him who feareth god is thy daughter due to be his wife therefore
another could not have her
then raguel said i doubt not but god hath regarded my prayers and
tears in his sight
and i believe he hath therefore made you come to me that this
maid might be married to one of her own kindred according to the law of
and taking the right hand of his daughter he gave it into the
right hand of tobias saying the god of abraham and the god of isaac
and the god of jacob be with you and may he join you together and
fulfil his blessing in you
and taking paper they made a writing of the marriage
and afterwards they made merry blessing god
and raguel called to him anna his wife and bade her to prepare
another chamber
and she brought sara her daughter in thither and she wept
and she said to her be of good cheer my daughter the lord of
heaven give thee joy for the trouble thou hast undergone
and after they had supped they brought in the young man to her
and tobias remembering the angels word took out of his bag part
of the liver and laid it upon burning coals
then the angel raphael took the devil and bound him in the desert
of upper egypt
then tobias exhorted the virgin and said to her sara arise and
let us pray to god to day and to morrow and the next day because for
these three nights we are joined to god and when the third night is
over we will be in our own wedlock
for we are the children of saints and we must not be joined
together like heathens that know not god
so they both arose and prayed earnestly both together that health
might be given them
and tobias said lord god of our fathers may the heavens and the
earth and the sea and the fountains and the rivers and all thy
creatures that are in them bless thee
thou madest adam of the slime of the earth and gavest him eve for
a helper
and now lord thou knowest that not for fleshly lust do i take my
sister to wife but only for the love of posterity in which thy name
may be blessed for ever and ever
sara also said have mercy on us o lord have mercy on us and
let us grow old both together in health
and it came to pass about the cockcrowing raguel ordered his
servants to be called for and they went with him together to dig a
grave
for he said lest perhaps it may have happened to him in like
manner as it did to the other seven husbands that went in unto her
and when they had prepared the pit raguel went back to his wife
and said to her
send one of thy maids and let her see if he be dead that i may
bury him before it be day
so she sent one of her maidservants who went into the chamber
and found them safe and sound sleeping both together
and returning she brought the good news and raguel and anna his
wife blessed the lord
and said we bless thee o lord god of israel because it hath not
happened as we suspected
for thou hast shewn thy mercy to us and hast shut out from us the
enemy that persecuted us
and thou hast taken pity upon two only children make them o
praise and of their health that all nations may know that thou alone
art god in all the earth
and immediately raguel commanded his servants to fill up the pit
they had made before it was day
and he spoke to his wife to make ready a feast and prepare all
kind of provisions that are necessary for such as go a journey
he caused also two fat kine and four wethers to be killed and a
banquet to be prepared for all his neighbours and all his friends
and raguel adjured tobias to abide with him two weeks
and of all things which raguel possessed he gave one half to
their decease come also to tobias
him to the marriage
then tobias called the angel to him whom he took to be a man and
said to him brother azarias i pray thee hearken to my words
if i should give myself to be thy servant i should not make a
worthy return for thy care
however i beseech thee to take with thee beasts and servants and
to go to gabelus to rages the city of the medes and to restore to him
his note of hand and receive of him the money and desire him to come
to my wedding
for thou knowest that my father numbereth the days and if i stay
one day more his soul will be afflicted
and indeed thou seest how raguel hath adjured me whose adjuring i
cannot despise
then raphael took four of raguels servants and two camels and
went to rages the city of the medes and finding gabelus gave him his
note of hand and received of him all the money
and he told him concerning tobias the son of tobias all that had
been done and made him come with him to the wedding
and when he was come into raguels house he found tobias sitting at
the table and he leaped up and they kissed each other and gabelus
wept and blessed god
and said the god of israel bless thee because thou art the son of
a very good and just man and that feareth god and doth almsdeeds
and may a blessing come upon thy wife and upon your parents
and may you see your children and your childrens children unto
the third and fourth generation and may your seed be blessed by the god
of israel who reigneth for ever and ever
and when all had said amen they went to the feast but the
marriage feast they celebrated also with the fear of the lord
return
but as tobias made longer stay upon occasion of the marriage
tarry or why is he detained there
is gabelus dead thinkest thou and no man will pay him the money
and he began to be exceeding sad both he and anna his wife with
him and they began both to weep together because their son did not
return to them on the day appointed
but his mother wept and was quite disconsolate and said woe woe
is me my son why did we send thee to go to a strange country the
light of our eyes the staff of our old age the comfort of our life
the hope of our posterity
we having all things together in thee alone ought not to have let
thee go from us
and tobias said to her hold thy peace and be not troubled our
son is safe that man with whom we sent him is very trusty
but she could by no means be comforted but daily running out
looked round about and went into all the ways by which there seemed any
hope he might return that she might if possible see him coming afar
off
but raguel said to his soninlaw stay here and i will send a
messenger to tobias thy father that thou art in health
and tobias said to him i know that my father and mother now count
the days and their spirit is grievously afflicted within them
and when raguel had pressed tobias with many words and he by no
means would hearken to him he delivered sara unto him and half of all
his substance in menservants and womenservants in cattle in camels
and in kine and in much money and sent him away safe and joyful from
him
saying the holy angel of the lord be with you in your journey
and bring you through safe and that you may find all things well about
your parents and my eyes may see your children before i die
and the parents taking their daughter kissed her and let her go
admonishing her to honour her father and motherinlaw to love
her husband to take care of the family to govern the house and to
behave herself irreprehensibly
recovereth his sight
and as they were returning they came to charan which is in the
midway to ninive the eleventh day
and the angel said brother tobias thou knowest how thou didst
leave thy father
if it please thee therefore let us go before and let the family
follow softly after us together with thy wife and with the beasts
and as this their going pleased him raphael said to tobias take
with thee of the gall of the fish for it will be necessary so tobias
took some of that gall and departed
but anna sat beside the way daily on the top of a hill from
whence she might see afar off
and while she watched his coming from that place she saw him afar
off and presently perceived it was her son coming and returning she
told her husband saying behold thy son cometh
and raphael said to tobias as soon as thou shalt come into thy
house forthwith adore the lord thy god and giving thanks to him go to
thy father and kiss him
and immediately anoint his eyes with this gall of the fish which
thou carriest with thee for be assured that his eyes shall be presently
opened and thy father shall see the light of heaven and shall rejoice
in the sight of thee
then the dog which had been with them in the way ran before and
coming as if he had brought the news shewed his joy by his fawning and
wagging his tail
in sacred history but as we learn from our saviour st matt
there are iotas and tittles in the word of god that is to say things
that appear minute but which have indeed a deep and mysterious meaning
in them
and his father that was blind rising up began to run stumbling
with his feet and giving a servant his hand went to meet his son
and receiving him kissed him as did also his wife and they
began to weep for joy
and when they had adored god and given him thanks they sat down
together
then tobias taking of the gall of the fish anointed his fathers
eyes
and he stayed about half an hour and a white skin began to come
out of his eyes like the skin of an egg
and tobias took hold of it and drew it from his eyes and
recovered his sight
and they glorified god both he and his wife and all that knew
him
and tobias said i bless thee o lord god of israel because thou
hast chastised me and thou hast saved me and behold i see tobias my
son
and after seven days sara his sons wife and all the family
arrived safe and the cattle and the camels and an abundance of money
of his wifes and that money also which he had received of gabelus
and he told his parents all the benefits of god which he had
done to him by the man that conducted him
and achior and nabath the kinsmen of tobias came rejoicing for
done for him
and for seven days they feasted and rejoiced all with great joy
then tobias called to him his son and said to him what can we
give to this holy man that is come with thee
tobias answering said to his father father what wages shall we
give him or what can be worthy of his benefits
he conducted me and brought me safe again he received the money
of gabelus he caused me to have my wife and he chased from her the
evil spirit he gave joy to her parents myself he delivered from being
devoured by the fish thee also he hath made to see the light of heaven
and we are filled with all good things through him what can we give him
sufficient for these things
but i beseech thee my father to desire him that he would
vouchsafe to accept of one half of all things that have been brought
so the father and the son calling him took him aside and began
to desire him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things
that they had brought
then he said to them secretly bless ye the god of heaven give
glory to him in the sight of all that live because he hath shewn his
mercy to you
for it is good to hide the secret of a king to reveal and confess
the works of god
prayer is good with fasting and alms more than to lay up treasures
of gold
for alms delivereth from death and the same is that which purgeth
away sins and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting
but they that commit sin and iniquity are enemies to their own
soul
i discover then the truth unto you and i will not hide the
secret from you
when thou didst pray with tears and didst bury the dead and
didst leave thy dinner and hide the dead by day in thy house and bury
them by night i offered thy prayer to the lord
and because thou wast acceptable to god it was necessary that
temptation should prove thee
and now the lord hath sent me to heal thee and to deliver sara
thy sons wife from the devil
for i am the angel raphael one of the seven who stand before
the lord
and when they had heard these things they were troubled and
being seized with fear they fell upon the ground on their face
and the angel said to them peace be to you fear not
for when i was with you i was there by the will of god bless ye
him and sing praises to him
i seemed indeed to eat and to drink with you but i use an
invisible meat and drink which cannot be seen by men
it is time therefore that i return to him that sent me but bless
ye god and publish all his wonderful works
and when he had said these things he was taken from their sight
and they could see him no more
then they lying prostrate for three hours upon their face
blessed god and rising up they told all his wonderful works
and tobias the elder opening his mouth blessed the lord and
said thou art great o lord for ever and thy kingdom is unto all ages
for thou scourgest and thou savest thou leadest down to hell
and bringest up again and there is none that can escape thy hand
give glory to the lord ye children of israel and praise him in
the sight of the gentiles
because he hath therefore scattered you among the gentiles who
know not him that you may declare his wonderful works and make them
know that there is no other almighty god besides him
he hath chastised us for our iniquities and he will save us for
his own mercy
see then what he hath done with us and with fear and trembling
give ye glory to him and extol the eternal king of worlds in your
works
as for me i will praise him in the land of my captivity because
he hath shewn his majesty toward a sinful nation
be converted therefore ye sinners and do justice before god
believing that he will shew his mercy to you
and i and my soul will rejoice in him
bless ye the lord all his elect keep days of joy and give
glory to him
jerusalem city of god the lord hath chastised thee for the
works of thy hands
chapter with relation to jerusalem is partly to be understood of the
rebuilding of the city after the captivity and partly of the spiritual
heaven
give glory to the lord for thy good things and bless the god
eternal that he may rebuild his tabernacle in thee and may call back
all the captives to thee and thou mayst rejoice for ever and ever
thou shalt shine with a glorious light and all the ends of the
earth shall worship thee
nations from afar shall come to thee and shall bring gifts and
shall adore the lord in thee and shall esteem thy land as holy
for they shall call upon the great name in thee
they shall be cursed that shall despise thee and they shall be
condemned that shall blaspheme thee and blessed shall they be that
shall build thee up
but thou shalt rejoice in thy children because they shall all be
blessed and shall be gathered together to the lord
blessed are all they that love thee and that rejoice in thy
peace
my soul bless thou the lord because the lord our god hath
delivered jerusalem his city from all her troubles
happy shall i be if there shall remain of my seed to see the
glory of jerusalem
the gates of jerusalem shall be built of sapphire and of
emerald and all the walls thereof round about of precious stones
all its streets shall be paved with white and clean stones and
blessed be the lord who hath exalted it and may he reign over
it for ever and ever amen
his son and grandsons to piety foreshewing that ninive shall be
destroyed and jerusalem rebuilt the younger tobias returneth with his
family to raguel and dieth happily as he had lived
and the words of tobias were ended and after tobias was restored
to his sight he lived two and forty years and saw the children of his
grandchildren
and after he had lived a hundred and two years he was buried
honorably in ninive
for he was six and fifty years old when he lost the sight of his
eyes and sixty when he recovered it again
and the rest of his life was in joy and with great increase of
the fear of god he departed in peace
and at the hour of his death he called unto him his son tobias and
his children seven young men his grandsons and said to them
the destruction of ninive is at hand for the word of the lord
must be fulfilled and our brethren that are scattered abroad from the
land of israel shall return to it
and all the land thereof that is desert shall be filled with
people and the house of god which is burnt in it shall again be
rebuilt and all that fear god shall return thither
and the gentiles shall leave their idols and shall come into
and all the kings of the earth shall rejoice in it adoring the
hearken therefore my children to your father serve the lord in
truth and seek to do the things that please him
and command your children that they do justice and almsdeeds and
that they be mindful of god and bless him at all times in truth and
with all their power
and now children hear me and do not stay here but as soon as
you shall bury your mother by me in one sepulchre without delay direct
your steps to depart hence
for i see that its iniquity will bring it to destruction
and it came to pass that after the death of his mother tobias
departed out of ninive with his wife and children and childrens
children and returned to his father and motherinlaw
and he found them in health in a good old age and he took care
of them and he closed their eyes and all the inheritance of raguels
house came to him and he saw his childrens children to the fifth
generation
and after he had lived ninetynine years in the fear of the lord
with joy they buried him
and all his kindred and all his generation continued in good
life and in holy conversation so that they were acceptable both to
priest eliachim called also joachim the transactions herein related
most probably happened in his days and in the reign of manasses after
his repentance and return from captivity it takes its name from that
illustrious woman by whose virtue and fortitude and armed with prayer
the children of israel were preserved from the destruction threatened
them by holofernes and his great army it finishes with her canticle of
thanksgiving to god
