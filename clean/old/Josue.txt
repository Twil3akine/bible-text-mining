themselves to pass over the jordan
now it came to pass after the death of moses the servant of the
moses my servant is dead arise and pass over this jordan thou
and thy people with thee into the land which i will give to the
children of israel
i will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall
tread upon as i have said to moses
from the desert and from libanus unto the great river euphrates
all the land of the hethites unto the great sea toward the going down
of the sun shall be your border
no man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life as i
have been with moses so will i be with thee i will not leave thee nor
forsake thee
take courage and be strong for thou shalt divide by lot to this
people the land for which i swore to their fathers that i would deliver
it to them
take courage therefore and be very valiant that thou mayst
observe and do all the law which moses my servant hath commanded thee
turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayst
understand all things which thou dost
let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth but thou shalt
meditate on it day and night that thou mayst observe and do all things
that are written in it then shalt thou direct thy way and understand
it
behold i command thee take courage and be strong fear not and
be not dismayed because the lord thy god is with thee in all things
whatsoever thou shalt go to
and josue commanded the princes of the people saying pass
through the midst of the camp and command the people and say
prepare your victuals for after the third day you shall pass over
the jordan and shall go in to possess the land which the lord your god
will give you
and he said to the rubenites and the gadites and the half tribe
of manasses
remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded
you saying the lord your god hath given you rest and all this land
your wives and children and cattle shall remain in the land
which moses gave you on this side of the jordan but pass you over armed
before your brethren all of you that are strong of hand and fight for
them
until the lord give rest to your brethren as he hath given you
and they also possess the land which the lord your god will give them
and so you shall return into the land of your possession and you shall
dwell in it which moses the servant of the lord gave you beyond the
and they made answer to josue and said all that thou hast
commanded us we will do and whither soever thou shalt send us we will
go
as we obeyed moses in all things so will we obey thee also only
be the lord thy god with thee as he was with moses
he that shall gainsay thy mouth and not obey all thy words that
thou shalt command him let him die only take thou courage and do
manfully
and josue the son of nun sent from setim two men to spy
secretly and said to them go and view the land and the city of
harlot named rahab and lodged with her
and it was told the king of jericho and was said behold there are
men come in hither by night of the children of israel to spy the
land
and the king of jericho sent to rahab saying bring forth the men
that came to thee and are entered into thy house for they are spies
and are come to view all the land
and the woman taking the men hid them and said i confess they
came to me but i knew not whence they were
and at the time of shutting the gate in the dark they also went
out together i know not whither they are gone pursue after them
quickly and you will overtake them
but she made the men go up to the top of her house and covered
them with the stalks of flax which was there
now they that were sent pursued after them by the way that
leadeth to the fords of the jordan and as soon as they were gone out
the gate was presently shut
the men that were hid were not yet asleep when behold the woman
went up to them and said
i know that the lord hath given this land to you for the dread of
you is fallen upon us and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all
strength
we have heard that the lord dried up the water of the red sea at
your going in when you came out of egypt and what things you did to
the two kings of the amorrhites that were beyond the jordan sehon and
and at the hearing these things we were affrighted and our heart
fainted away neither did there remain any spirit in us at your coming
in for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in the earth
beneath
now therefore swear ye to me by the lord that as i have shewed
mercy to you so you also will shew mercy to my fathers house and give
me a true token
that you will save my father and mother my brethren and sisters
and all things that are theirs and deliver our souls from death
they answered her be our lives for you unto death only if thou
betray us not and when the lord shall have delivered us the land we
will shew thee mercy and truth
then she let them down with a cord out of a window for her house
joined close to the wall
and she said to them get ye up to the mountains lest perhaps
they meet you as they return and there lie ye hid three days till they
come back and so you shall go on your way
and they said to her we shall be blameless of this oath which
thou hast made us swear
if when we come into the land this scarlet cord be a sign and
thou tie it in the window by which thou hast let us down and gather
together thy father and mother and brethren and all thy kindred into
thy house
whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house his blood shall
be upon his own head and we shall be quit but the blood of all that
shall be with thee in the house shall light upon our head if any man
touch them
but if thou wilt betray us and utter this word abroad we shall
be quit of this oath which thou hast made us swear
and she answered as you have spoken so be it done and sending
them on their way she hung the scarlet cord in the window
but they went and came to the mountains and stayed there three
days till they that pursued them were returned for having sought them
through all the way they found them not
and when they were gone back into the city the spies returned
and came down from the mountain and passing over the jordan they came
to josue the son of nun and told him all that befel them
and said the lord hath delivered all this land into our hands
and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear
children of israel
and josue rose before daylight and removed the camp and they
departed from setim and came to the jordan he and all the children of
after which the heralds went through the midst of the camp
and began to proclaim when you shall see the ark of the covenant
of the lord your god and the priests of the race of levi carrying it
rise you up also and follow them as they go before
and let there be between you and the ark the space of two thousand
cubits that you may see it afar off and know which way you must go
for you have not gone this way before and take care you come not near
the ark
and josue said to the people be ye sanctified for tomorrow the
and he said to the priests take up the ark of the covenant and go
before the people and they obeyed his commands and took it up and
walked before them
and the lord said to josue this day will i begin to exalt thee
before israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i am with
thee also
and do thou command the priests that carry the ark of the
covenant and say to them when you shall have entered into part of the
water of the jordan stand in it
and josue said to the children of israel come hither and hear the
word of the lord your god
and again he said by this you shall know that the lord the
living god is in the midst of you and that he shall destroy before
your sight the chanaanite and the hethite the hevite and the
behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth shall
go before you into the jordan
prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of israel one of every tribe
and when the priests that carry the ark of the lord the god of
the whole earth shall set the soles of their feet in the waters of the
that come from above shall stand together upon a heap
so the people went out of their tents to pass over the jordan
and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant went on before
them
and as soon as they came into the jordan and their feet were
dipped in part of the water now the jordan it being harvest time had
filled the banks of its channel
the waters that came down from above stood in one place and
swelling up like a mountain were seen afar off from the city that is
called adom to the place of sarthan but those that were beneath ran
down into the sea of the wilderness which now is called the dead sea
until they wholly failed
and the people marched over against jericho and the priests that
carried the ark of the covenant of the lord stood girded upon the dry
ground in the midst of the jordan and all the people passed over
through the channel that was dried up
the miracle and other twelve are placed in the midst of the river
and when they were passed over the lord said to josue
choose twelve men one of every tribe
and command them to take out of the midst of the jordan where the
feet of the priests stood twelve very hard stones which you shall set
in the place of the camp where you shall pitch your tents this night
and josue called twelve men whom he had chosen out of the children
of israel one out of every tribe
and he said to them go before the ark of the lord your god to the
midst of the jordan and carry from thence every man a stone on your
shoulders according to the number of the children of israel
that it may be a sign among you and when your children shall ask
you tomorrow saying what means these stones
you shall answer them the waters of the jordan ran off before the
ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over the same therefore
were these stones set for a monument of the children of israel forever
the children of israel therefore did as josue commanded them
carrying out of the channel of the jordan twelve stones as the lord had
commanded him according to the number of the children of israel unto the
place wherein they camped and there they set them
and josue put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of
the jordan where the priests stood that carried the ark of the
covenant and they are there until this present day
now the priests that carried the ark stood in the midst of the
made haste and passed over
and when they had all passed over the ark also of the lord passed
over and the priests went before the people
the children of ruben also and gad and half the tribe of
commanded them
and forty thousand fighting men by their troops and bands marched
through the plains and fields of the city of jericho
in that day the lord magnified josue in the sight of all israel
that they should fear him as they had feared moses while he lived
and he said to him
command the priests that carry the ark of the covenant to come
up out of the jordan
and he commanded them saying come ye up out of the jordan
and when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the lord
were come up and began to tread on the dry ground the waters returned
into their channel and ran as they were wont before
and the people came up out of the jordan the tenth day of the
first month and camped in galgal over against the east side of the
city of jericho
and the twelve stones which they had taken out of the channel of
the jordan josue pitched in galgal
and said to the children of israel when your children shall ask
their fathers tomorrow and shall say to them what mean these stones
you shall teach them and say israel passed over this jordan
through the dry channel
the lord your god drying up the waters thereof in your sight
until you passed over
as he had done before in the red sea which he dried up till we
passed through
that all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of
the lord that you also may fear the lord your god for ever
angel appeareth to josue
now when all the kings of the amorrhites who dwelt beyond the
near the great sea had heard that the lord had dried up the waters of
the jordan before the children of israel till they passed over their
heart failed them and there remained no spirit in them fearing the
coming in of the children of israel
at that time the lord said to josue make thee knives of stone and
circumcise the second time the children of israel
be circumcised again but that they were now to renew and take up again
the practice of circumcision which had been omitted during their forty
years sojourning in the wilderness by reason of their being always
uncertain when they should be obliged to march
he did what the lord had commanded and he circumcised the children
of israel in the hill of the foreskins
now this is the cause of the second circumcision all the people
that came out of egypt that were males all the men fit for war died in
the desert during the time of the long going about in the way
now these were all circumcised but the people that were born in
the desert
during the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness were
uncircumcised till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice
of the lord and to whom he had sworn before that he would not shew
them the land flowing with milk and honey
the children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers and
were circumcised by josue for they were uncircumcised even as they were
born and no one had circumcised them in the way
now after they were all circumcised they remained in the same
place of the camp until they were healed
and the lord said to josue this day have i taken away from you the
reproach of egypt and the name of that place was called galgal until
this present day
and the children of israel abode in galgal and they kept the
phase on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of
and they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn of the
land and frumenty of the same year
and the manna ceased after they ate of the corn of the land
neither did the children of israel use that food any more but they ate
of the corn of the present year of the land of chanaan
and when josue was in the field of the city of jericho he lifted
up his eyes and saw a man standing over against him holding a drawn
sword and he went to him and said art thou one of ours or of our
adversaries
and he answered no but i am prince of the host of the lord and
now i am come
of the people of israel dan
josue fell on his face to the ground and worshipping said what
saith my lord to his servant
of an inferior kind suitable to the dignity of his person
loose saith he thy shoes from off thy feet for the place
whereon thou standest is holy and josue did as was commanded him
walls of jericho fall down and the city is taken and destroyed
now jericho was close shut up and fenced for fear of the children
of israel and no man durst go out or come in
and the lord said to josue behold i have given into thy hands
go round about the city all ye fighting men once a day so shall ye
do for six days
and on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets
which are used in the jubilee and shall go before the ark of the
covenant and you shall go about the city seven times and the priests
shall sound the trumpets
and when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken
tune and shall sound in your ears all the people shall shout together
with a very great shout and the walls of the city shall fall to the
ground and they shall enter in every one at the place against which
they shall stand
then josue the son of nun called the priests and said to them
trumpets of the jubilee and march before the ark of the lord
and he said to the people go and compass the city armed
marching before the ark of the lord
and when josue had ended his words and the seven priests blew the
seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the lord
and all the armed men went before the rest of the common people
followed the ark and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides
but josue had commanded the people saying you shall not shout
nor shall your voice be heard nor any word go out of your mouth until
the day come wherein i shall say to you cry and shout
so the ark of the lord went about the city once a day and
returning into the camp abode there
and josue rising before day the priests took the ark of the lord
and seven of them seven trumpets which are used in the jubilee
and they went before the ark of the lord walking and sounding the
trumpets and the armed men went before them and the rest of the common
people followed the ark and they blew the trumpets
and they went round about the city the second day once and
returned into the camp so they did six days
but the seventh day rising up early they went about the city as
it was ordered seven times
and when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the
trumpets josue said to all israel shout for the lord hath delivered
the city to you
and let this city be an anathema and all things that are in it
to the lord let only rahab the harlot live with all that are with
her in the house for she hid the messengers whom we sent
but beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are
forbidden and you be guilty of transgression and all the camp of
but whatsoever gold or silver there shall be or vessels of brass
and iron let it be consecrated to the lord laid up in his treasures
so all the people making a shout and the trumpets sounding when
the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude the
walls forthwith fell down and every man went up by the place that was
over against him and they took the city
and killed all that were in it man and woman young and old the
oxen also and the sheep and the asses they slew with the edge of the
sword
but josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies go
into the harlots house and bring her out and all things that are
hers as you assured her by oath
and the young men went in and brought out rahab and her parents
her brethren also and all her goods and her kindred and made them to
stay without the camp
but they burned the city and all things that were therein except
the gold and silver and vessels of brass and iron which they
consecrated unto the treasury of the lord
but josue saved rahab the harlot and her fathers house and all
she had and they dwelt in the midst of israel until this present day
because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out jericho at
that time josue made an imprecation saying
cursed be the man before the lord that shall raise up and build
the city of jericho in his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof
and in the last of his children set up its gates
sounding of the trumpets by the priests the preaching of the word of
converted and a dreadful curse will light on them who build them up
again
and the lord was with josue and his name was noised throughout
all the land
is found out and stoned to death and gods wrath is turned from them
but the children of israel transgressed the commandment and took
to their own use of that which was accursed for achan the son of
something of the anathema and the lord was angry against the children
of israel
and when josue sent men from jericho against hai which is beside
up and view the country and they fulfilled his command and viewed
and returning they said to him let not all the people go up but
let two or three thousand men go and destroy the city why should all
the people be troubled in vain against enemies that are very few
there went up therefore three thousand fighting men who
immediately turned their backs
and were defeated by the men of the city of hai and there fell of
them six and thirty men and the enemies pursued them from the gate as
far as sabarim and they slew them as they fled by the descent and the
heart of the people was struck with fear and melted like water
but josue rent his garments and fell flat on the ground before
the ark of the lord until the evening both he and all the ancients of
and josue said alas o lord god why wouldst thou bring this
people over the river jordan to deliver us into the hand of the
my lord god what shall i say seeing israel turning their backs to
their enemies
the chanaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of
it and being gathered together will surround us and cut off our name
from the earth and what wilt thou do to thy great name
and the lord said to josue arise why liest thou flat on the
ground
israel hath sinned and transgressed my covenant and they have
taken of the anathema and have stolen and lied and have hid it among
their goods
neither can israel stand before his enemies but he shall flee
from them because he is defiled with the anathema i will be no more
with you till you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness
arise sanctify the people and say to them be ye sanctified
against tomorrow for thus saith the lord god of israel the curse is in
the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before thy enemies
till he be destroyed out of thee that is defiled with this wickedness
and you shall come in the morning every one by your tribes and
what tribe soever the lot shall find it shall come by its kindreds and
the kindred by its houses and tho house by the men
and whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact he
shall be burnt with fire with all his substance because he hath
transgressed the covenant of the lord and hath done wickedness in
josue therefore when he rose in the morning made israel to come
by their tribes and the tribe of juda was found
which being brought by in families it was found to be the family
of zare bringing that also by the houses he found it to be zabdi
and bringing his house man by man he found achan the son of
and josue said to achan my son give glory to the lord god of
and achan answered josue and said to him indeed i have sinned
against the lord the god of israel and thus and thus have i done
for i saw among the spoils a scarlet garment exceeding good and
two hundred sicles of silver and a golden rule of fifty sicles and i
coveted them and i took them away and hid them in the ground in the
midst of my tent and the silver i covered with the earth that i dug up
josue therefore sent ministers who running to his tent found all
hid in the same place together with the silver
and taking them away out of the tent they brought them to josue
and to all the children of israel and threw them down before the lord
then josue and all israel with him took achan the son of zare
and the silver and the garment and the golden rule his sons also and
his daughters his oxen and asses and sheep the tent also and all
the goods and brought them to the valley of achor
their father
where josue said because thou hast troubled us the lord trouble
thee this day and all israel stoned him and all things that were his
were consumed with fire
and they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones which
remaineth until this present day and the wrath of the lord was turned
away from them and the name of that place was called the valley of
built and sacrifices offered the law is written on stones and the
blessings and cursings are read before all the people
and the lord said to josue fear not nor be thou dismayed take
with thee all the multitude of fighting men arise and go up to the
town of hai behold i have delivered into thy hand the king thereof and
the people and the city and the land
and thou shalt do to the city of hai and to the king thereof as
thou hast done to jericho and to the king thereof but the spoils and
all the cattle you shall take for a prey to yourselves lay an ambush
for the city behind it
and josue arose and all the army of the fighting men with him to
go up against hai and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant men in the
night
and commanded them saying lay an ambush behind the city and go
not very far from it and be ye all ready
but i and the rest of the multitude which is with me will
approach on the contrary side against the city and when they shall
come out against us we will flee and turn our backs as we did before
till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city for they will
think that we flee as before
and whilst we are fleeing and they pursuing you shall rise out of
the ambush and shall destroy the city and the lord your god will
deliver it into your hands
and when you shall have taken it set it on fire and you shall do
all things so as i have commanded
and he sent them away and they went on to the place of the ambush
and abode between bethel and hai on the west side of the city of hai
and rising early in the morning he mustered his soldiers and
went up with the ancients in the front of the army environed with the
aid of the fighting men
and when they were come and were gone up over against the city
they stood on the north side of the city between which and them there
was a valley in the midst
and he had chosen five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush
between bethel and hai on the west side of the same city
ver
but all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north
side so that the last of that multitude reached to the west side of the
city so josue went that night and stood in the midst of the valley
and when the king of hai saw this he made haste in the morning
and went out with all the army of the city and set it in battle array
toward the desert not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his back
but josue and all israel gave back making as if they were
afraid and fleeing by the way of the wilderness
but they shouting together and encouraging one another pursued
them and when they were come from the city
and not one remained in the city of hai and of bethel that did
not pursue after israel leaving the towns open as they had rushed out
the lord said to josue lift up the shield that is in thy hand
towards the city of hai for i will deliver it to thee
and when he had lifted up his shield towards the city the ambush
that lay hid rose up immediately and going to the city took it and
set it on fire
and the men of the city that pursued after josue looking back
and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven had no more power to
flee this way or that way especially as they that had counterfeited
flight and were going toward the wilderness turned back most valiantly
against them that pursued
so josue and all israel seeing that the city was taken and that
the smoke of the city rose up returned and slew the men of hai
and they also that had taken and set the city on fire issuing out
of the city to meet their own men began to cut off the enemies who were
surrounded by them so that the enemies being cut off on both sides not
one of so great a multitude was saved
and they took the king of the city of hai alive and brought him to
so all being slain that had pursued after israel in his flight to
the wilderness and falling by the sword in the same place the children
of israel returned and laid waste the city
and the number of them that fell that day both of men and women
was twelve thousand persons all of the city of hai
but josue drew not back his hand which he had stretched out on
high holding the shield till all the inhabitants of hai were slain
and the children of israel divided among them the cattle and the
prey of the city as the lord had commanded josue
and he burnt the city and made it a heap forever
and he hung the king thereof on a gibbet until the evening and
the going down of the sun then josue commanded and they took down his
carcass from the gibbet and threw it in the very entrance of the city
heaping upon it a great heap of stones which remaineth until this
present day
then josue built an altar to the lord the god of israel in mount
as moses the servant of the lord had commanded the children of
unhewn stones which iron had not touched and he offered upon it
holocausts to the lord and immolated victims of peace offerings
and he wrote upon stones the deuteronomy of the law of moses
which he had ordered before the children of israel
and all the people and the ancients and the princes and judges
stood on both sides of the ark before the priests that carried the ark
of the covenant of the lord both the stranger and he that was born
among them half of them by mount garizim and half by mount hebal as
people of israel
after this he read all the words of the blessing and the cursing
and all things that were written in the book of the law
he left out nothing of those things which moses had commanded but
he repeated all before all the people of israel with the women and
children and strangers that dwelt among them
be perpetual servants
now when these things were heard of all the kings beyond the
near the sea and on the coasts of the great sea they also that dwell
by libanus the hethite and the amorrhite the chanaanite the
gathered themselves together to fight against josue and israel
with one mind and one resolution
but they that dwelt in gabaon hearing all that josue had done to
cunningly devising took for themselves provisions laying old sacks
upon their asses and wine bottles rent and sewed up again
and very old shoes which for a show of age were clouted with
patches and old garments upon them the loaves also which they carried
for provisions by the way were hard and broken into pieces
and they went to josue who then abode in the camp at galgal and
said to him and to all israel with him we are come from a far country
desiring to make peace with you and the children of israel answered
them and said
perhaps you dwell in the land which falls to our lot if so we can
make no league with you
but they said to josue we are thy servants josue said to them
they answered from a very far country thy servants are come in the
name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of his power all
the things that he did in egypt
and to the two kings of the amorrhites that were beyond the
and our ancients and all the inhabitants of our country said to
us take with you victuals for a long way and go meet them and say we
are your servants make ye a league with us
behold these loaves we took hot when we set out from our houses
to come to you now they are become dry and broken in pieces by being
exceeding old
these bottles of wine when we filled them were new now they are
rent and burst these garments we have on and the shoes we have on our
feet by reason of the very long journey are worn out and almost
consumed
they took therefore of their victuals and consulted not the mouth
of the lord
and josue made peace with them and entering into a league
promised that they should not be slain the princes also of the
multitude swore to them
now three days after the league was made they heard that they
dwelt nigh and they should be among them
and the children of israel removed the camp and came into their
cities on the third day the names of which are gabaon and caphira
and beroth and cariathiarim
and they slew them not because the princes of the multitude had
sworn in the name of the lord the god of israel then all the common
people murmured against the princes
and they answered them we have sworn to them in the name of the
but this we will do to them let their lives be saved lest the
wrath of the lord be stirred up against us if we should be forsworn
but so let them live as to serve the whole multitude in hewing
wood and bringing in water as they were speaking these things
josue called the gabaonites and said to them why would you
impose upon us saying we dwell very far off from you whereas you are
in the midst of us
therefore you shall be under a curse and your race shall always
be hewers of wood and carriers of water into the house of my god
they answered it was told us thy servants that the lord thy god
had promised his servant moses to give you all the land and to destroy
all the inhabitants thereof therefore we feared exceedingly and
provided for our lives compelled by the dread we had of you and we
took this counsel
and now we are in thy hand deal with us as it seemeth good and
right unto thee
so josue did as he had said and delivered them from the hand of
the children of israel that they should not be slain
and he gave orders in that day that they should be in the service
of all the people and of the altar of the lord hewing wood and
carrying water until this present time in the place which the lord
hath chosen
hailstones at the prayer of josue the sun and moon stand still the
space of one day the five kings are hanged divers cities are taken
when adonisedec king of jerusalem had heard these things to
wit that josue had taken hai and had destroyed it for as he had done
to jericho and the king thereof so did he to hai and its king and that
the gabaonites were gone over to israel and were their confederates
he was exceedingly afraid for gabaon was a great city and one of
the royal cities and greater than the town of hai and all its fighting
men were most valiant
therefore adonisedec king of jerusalem sent to oham king of
and to dabir king of eglon saying
come up to me and bring help that we may take gabaon because it
hath gone over to josue and to the children of israel
so the five kings of the amorrhites being assembled together went
up the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jerimoth the
king of lachis the king of eglon they and their armies and camped
about gabaon laying siege to it
but the inhabitants of the city of gabaon which was besieged
sent to josue who then abode in the camp at galgal and said to him
save us and bring us succour for all the kings of the amorrhites who
dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us
and josue went up from galgal and all the army of the warriors
with him most valiant men
but the lord said to josue fear them not for i have delivered
them into thy hands none of them shall be able to stand against thee
so josue going up from galgal all the night came upon them
suddenly
and the lord troubled them at the sight of israel and he slew
them with a great slaughter in gabaon and pursued them by the way of
the ascent to bethoron and cut them off all the way to azeca and
and when they were fleeing from the children of israel and were
in the descent of bethoron the lord cast down upon them great stones
from heaven as far as azeca and many more were killed with the
hailstones than were slain by the swords of the children of israel
then josue spoke to the lord in the day that he delivered the
them move not o sun toward gabaon nor thou o moon toward the
valley of ajalon
and the sun and the moon stood still till the people revenged
themselves of their enemies is not this written in the book of the
just so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to
go down the space of one day
lost
there was not before nor after so long a day the lord obeying
the voice of a man and fighting for israel
and josue returned with all israel into the camp of galgal
for the five kings were fled and had hid themselves in a cave of
the city of maceda
and it was told josue that the five kings were found hid in a
cave of the city of maceda
and he commanded them that were with him saying roll great
stones to the mouth of the cave and set careful men to keep them shut
up
and stay you not but pursue after the enemies and kill all the
hindermost of them as they flee and do not suffer them whom the lord
cities
so the enemies being slain with a great slaughter and almost
utterly consumed they that were able to escape from israel entered
into fenced cities
and all the army returned to josue in maceda where the camp
then was in good health and without the loss of any one and no man
durst move his tongue against the children of israel
and josue gave orders saying open the mouth of the cave and
bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein
and the ministers did as they were commanded and they brought
out to him the five kings out of the cave the king of jerusalem the
king of hebron the king of jerimoth the king of lachis the king of
and when they were brought out to him he called all the men of
set your feet on the necks of these kings and when they had gone and
put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them
he said again to them fear not neither be ye dismayed take
courage and be strong for so will the lord do to all your enemies
against whom you fight
and josue struck and slew them and hanged them upon five
gibbets and they hung until the evening
and when the sun was down he commanded the soldiers to take them
down from the gibbets and after they were taken down they cast them
into the cave where they had lain hid and put great stones at the
mouth thereof which remain until this day
the same day josue took maceda and destroyed it with the edge of
the sword and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof he left
not in it the least remains and he did to the king of maceda as he had
done to the king of jericho
and he passed from maceda with all israel to lebna and fought
against it
and the lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of
the inhabitants thereof they left not in it any remains and they did
to the king of lebna as they had done to the king of jericho
from lebna he passed unto lachis with all israel and investing
it with his army besieged it
and the lord delivered lachis into the hands of israel and he
took it the following day and put it to the sword and every soul that
was in it as he had done to lebna
at that time horam king of gazer came up to succour lachis and
and he passed from lachis to eglon and surrounded it
and took it the same day and put to the sword all the souls that
were in it according to all that he had done to lachis
he went up also with all israel from eglon to hebron and fought
against it
took it and destroyed it with the edge of the sword the king
also thereof and all the towns of that country and all the souls that
dwelt in it he left not therein any remains as he had done to eglon
so did he also to hebron putting to the sword all that he found in it

returning from thence to dabir
he took it and destroyed it the king also thereof and all the
towns round about he destroyed with the edge of the sword he left not
in it any remains as he had done to hebron and lebna and to their
kings so did he to dabir and to the king thereof
so josue conquered all the country of the hills and of the
south and of the plain and of asedoth with their kings he left not
any remains therein but slew all that breathed as the lord the god of
utterly destroyed in punishment of their manifold abomination and that
they might not draw the israelites into the like sins
from cadesbarne even to gaza all the land of gosen even to
and all their kings and their lands he took and wasted at one
onset for the lord the god of israel fought for him
and he returned with all israel to the place of the camp in
and when jabin king of asor had heard these things he sent to
and to the kings of the north that dwelt in the mountains and in
the plains over against the south side of ceneroth and in the levels
and the countries of dor by the sea side
to the chanaanites also on the east and on the west and the
mountains to the hevite also who dwelt at the foot of hermon in the
land of maspha
and they all came out with their troops a people exceeding
numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore their horses also and
chariots a very great multitude
and all these kings assembled together at the waters of merom to
fight against israel
and the lord said to josue fear them not for to morrow at this
same hour i will deliver all these to be slain in the sight of israel
thou shalt hamstring their horses and thou shalt burn their chariots
with fire
ordained that his people might not trust in chariots and horses but in
him
and josue came and all the army with him against them to the
waters of merom on a sudden and fell upon them
and the lord delivered them into the hands of israel and they
defeated them and chased them as far as the great sidon and the waters
of maserophot and the field of masphe which is on the east thereof he
slew them all so as to leave no remains of them
and he did as the lord had commanded him he hamstringed their
horses and burned their chariots
and presently turning back he took asor and slew the king
thereof with the sword now asor of old was the head of all these
kingdoms
and he cut off all the souls that abode there he left not in it
any remains but utterly destroyed all and burned the city itself with
fire
and he took and put to the sword and destroyed all the cities
round about and their kings as moses the servant of god had commanded
him
except the cities that were on hills and high places the rest
and the children of israel divided among themselves all the spoil
of these cities and the cattle killing all the men
as the lord had commanded moses his servant so did moses command
commandments which the lord had commanded moses
so josue took all the country of the hills and of the south and
the land of gosen and the plains and the west country and the mountain
of israel and the plains thereof
and part of the mountain that goeth up to seir as far as baalgad
by the plain of libanus under mount hermon all their kings he took
smote and slew
josue made war a long time against these kings
there was not a city that delivered itself to the children of
fight
for it was the sentence of the lord that their hearts should be
hardened and they should fight against israel and fall and should not
deserve any clemency and should be destroyed as the lord had commanded
of yielding or submitting which was a sentence or judgment of god upon
them in punishment of their enormous crimes
at that time josue came and cut off the enancims from the
mountains from hebron and dabir and anab and from all the mountain
of juda and israel and destroyed their cities
he left not any of the stock of the enacims in the land of the
children of israel except the cities of gaza and geth and azotus in
which alone they were left
so josue took all the land as the lord spoke to moses and
delivered it in possession to the children of israel according to their
divisions and tribes and the land rested from wars
these are the kings whom the children of israel slew and
possessed their land beyond the jordan towards the rising of the sun
from the torrent arnon unto mount hermon and all the east country that
looketh towards the wilderness

the king of hesebon
moses the servant of the lord and the children of israel slew
them and moses delivered their land in possession to the rubenites and
these are the kings of the land whom josue and the children of
of libanus unto the mount part of which goeth up into seir and josue
delivered it in possession to the tribes of israel to every one their

josue was old and far advanced in years and the lord said to
him thou art grown old and advanced in age and there is a very large
country left which is not yet divided by lot
hundred and one years oldand their is a very large country left which
is not yet divided by lot not yet possessed by the children of

and his confines the country also of libanus towards the east
from baalgad under mount hermon to the entering into emath
of all that dwell in the mountains from libanus to the waters of
before the face of the children of israel so let their land come in as
a part of the inheritance of israel as i have commanded thee
and now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes and to
the half tribe of manasses
with whom ruben and gad have possessed the land which moses the
servant of the lord delivered to them beyond the river jordan on the
east side
from aroer which is upon the bank of the torrent arnon and in
the midst of the valley and all the plains of medaba as far as dibon
and all the cities of sehon king of the amorrhites who reigned
in hesebon unto the borders of the children of ammon
and galaad and the borders of gessuri and machati and all mount
all the kingdom of og in basan who reigned in astaroth and
destroyed them
and the children of israel would not destroy gessuri and machati
and they have dwelt in the midst of israel until this present day
but to the tribe of levi he gave no possession but the
sacrifices and victims of thee lord god of israel are his inheritance
as he spoke to him
and moses gave a possession to the children of ruben according to
their kindreds
and their border was from aroer which is on the bank of the
torrent arnon and in the midst of the valley of the same torrent all
the plain that leadeth to medaba
and hesebon and all their villages which are in the plains
and jassa and cidimoth and mephaath
and cariathaim and sabama and sarathasar in the mountain of the
valley
bethphogor and asedoth phasga and bethiesimoth
and all the cities of the plain and all the kingdoms of sehon
king of the amorrhites that reigned in hesebon whom moses slew with
the princes of madian hevi and recem and sur and hur and rebe dukes
of sehon inhabitants of the land
of king sehon they are said to have been slain with him that is about
the same time but not in the same battle
balaam also the son of beor the soothsayer the children of
and the river jordan was the border of the children of ruben
and villages
and moses gave to the tribe of gad and to his children by their
kindreds a possession of which this is the division
the border of jaser and all the cities of galaad and half the
land of the children of ammon as far as aroer which is over against
and from hesebon unto ramoth masphe and betonim and from manaim
unto the borders of dabir
and in the valley betharan and bethnemra and socoth and saphon
the other part of the kingdom of sehon king of hesebon the limit of
this also is the jordan as far as the uttermost part of the sea of
this is the possession of the children of gad by their families
their cities and villages
he gave also to the half tribe of manasses and his children
possession according to their kindreds
the beginning whereof is this from manaim all basan and all the
kingdoms of og king of basan and all the villages of jair which are in
and half galaad and astaroth and edrai cities of the kingdom
of og in basan to the children of machir the son of manasses to one
half of the children of machir according to their kindreds
this possession moses divided in the plains of moab beyond the
but to the tribe of levi he gave no possession because the lord
the god of israel himself is their possession as he spoke to them
this is what the children of israel possessed in the land of
princes of the families by the tribes of israel gave to them
dividing all by lot as the lord had commanded the hand of moses
to the nine tribes and the half tribe
for to two tribes and a half moses had given possession beyond the
but in their place succeeded the children of joseph divided into
two tribes of manasses and ephraim neither did the levites receive
other portion of land but cities to dwell in and their suburbs to feed
their beasts and flocks
one of those that were given to the priests to dwell in
as the lord had commanded moses so did the children of israel and
they divided the land
then the children of juda came to josue in galgal and caleb the
son of jephone the cenezite spoke to him thou knowest what the lord
spoke to moses the man of god concerning me and thee in cadesbarne
i was forty years old when moses the servant of the lord sent me
from cadesbarne to view the land and i brought him word again as to me
seemed true
but my brethren that had gone up with me discouraged the heart
of the people and i nevertheless followed the lord my god
and moses swore in that day saying the land which thy foot hath
trodden upon shall be thy possession and thy children for ever because
thou hast followed the lord my god
the lord therefore hath granted me life as he promised until
this present day it is forty and five years since the lord spoke this
word to moses when israel journeyed through the wilderness this day i
am eightyfive years old
as strong as i was at that time when i was sent to view the land
the strength of that time continueth in me until this day as well to
fight as to march
give me therefore this mountain which the lord promised in thy
hearing also wherein are the enacims and cities great and strong if
so be the lord will be with me and i shall be able to destroy them as
he promised me
and josue blessed him and gave him hebron in possession
and from that time hebron belonged to caleb the son of jephone
the cenezite until this present day because he followed the lord the
the name of hebron before was called cariatharbe adam the
greatest among the enacims was laid there and the land rested from wars
of juda
now the lot of the children of juda by their kindreds was this
uttermost part of the south coast
its beginning was from the top of the most salt sea and from the
bay thereof that looketh to the south
and it goeth out towards the ascent of the scorpion and passeth
on to sina and ascendeth into cadesbarne and reacheth into esron
going up to addar and compassing carcaa
and from thence passing along into asemona and reaching the
torrent of egypt and the bounds thereof shall be the great sea this
shall be the limit of the south coast
but on the east side the beginning shall be the most salt sea even
to the end of the jordan and towards the north from the bay of the sea
unto the same river jordan
and the border goeth up into bethhagla and passeth by the north
into betharaba going up to the stone of boen the son of ruben
and reaching as far as the borders of debara from the valley of
ascent of adommin on the south side of the torrent and the border
passeth the waters that are called the fountain of the sun and the
goings out thereof shall be at the fountain rogel
and it goeth up by the valley of the son of ennom on the side of
the jebusite towards the south the same is jerusalem and thence
ascending to the top of the mountain which is over against geennom to
the west in the end of the valley of raphaim northward
and it passeth on from the top of the mountain to the fountain of
the water of nephtoa and reacheth to the towns of mount ephron and it
bendeth towards baala which is cariathiarim that is to say the city
of the woods
and it compasseth from baala westward unto mount seir and
passeth by the side of mount jarim to the north into cheslon and goeth
down into bethsames and passeth into thamna
and reacheth northward to a part of accaron at the side and
bendeth to sechrona and passeth mount baala and cometh into jebneel
and is bounded westward with the great sea
these are the borders round about of the children of juda in
their kindreds
but to caleb the son of jephone he gave a portion in the midst of
the children of juda as the lord had commanded him cariatharbe the
father of enac which is hebron
and caleb destroyed out of it the three sons of enac sesai and
and going up from thence he came to the inhabitants of dabir
which before was called cariathsepher that is to say the city of
letters
and caleb said he that shall smite cariathsepher and take it
and othoniel the son of cenez the younger brother of caleb took
it and he gave him axa his daughter to wife
and as they were going together she was moved by her husband to
ask a field of her father and she sighed as she sat on her ass and
but she answered give me a blessing thou hast given me a
southern and dry land give me also a land that is watered and caleb
gave her the upper and the nether watery ground
this is the possession of the tribe of the children of juda by
their kindreds
and the cities from the uttermost parts of the children of juda
by the borders of edom to the south were cabseel and eder and jagur

and nebsan and the city of salt and engaddi six cities and
their villages
but the children of juda could not destroy the jebusite that
dwelt in jerusalem and the jebusite dwelt with the children of juda in
and the lot of the sons of joseph fell from the jordan over
against jericho and the waters thereof on the east the wilderness
which goeth up from jericho to the mountain of bethel
and goeth out from bethel to luza and passeth the border of
and goeth down westward by the border of jephleti unto the
borders of bethhoron the nether and to gazer and the countries of it
are ended by the great sea
and manasses and ephraim the children of joseph possessed it
and the border of the children of ephraim was according to their
kindreds and their possession towards the east was atarothaddar unto
and the confines go out unto the sea but machmethath looketh to
the north and it goeth round the borders eastward into thanathselo
and passeth along on the east side to janoe
towards the north by machmethath and then turned eastward to thanath
selo
and it goeth down from janoe into ataroth and naaratha and it
cometh to jericho and goeth out to the jordan
from taphua it passeth on towards the sea into the valley of
reeds and the goings out thereof are at the most salt sea this is the
possession of the tribe of the children of ephraim by their families
and there were cities with their villages separated for the
children of ephraim in the midst of the possession of the children of
and the children of ephraim slew not the chanaanite who dwelt in
paying tribute
and this lot fell to the tribe of manasses for he is the firstborn
of joseph to machir the firstborn of manasses the father of galaad who
was a warlike man and had for possession galaad and basan
and to the rest of the children of manasses according to their
families to the children of abiezer and to the children of helec and
to the children of esriel and to the children of sechem and to the
children of hepher and to the children of semida these are the male
children of manasses the son of joseph by their kindreds
but salphaad the son of hepher the son of galaad the son of machir
the son of manasses had no sons but only daughters whose names are
these maala and noa and hegla and melcha and thersa
and they came in the presence of eleazar the priest and of josue
the son of nun and of the princes saying the lord commanded by the
hand of moses that a possession should be given us in the midst of our
brethren and he gave them according to the commandment of the lord a
possession amongst the brethren of their father
and there fell ten portions to manasses beside the land of galaad
and basan beyond the jordan
for the daughters of manasses possessed inheritance in the midst
of his sons and the land of galaad fell to the lot of the rest of the
children of manasses
and the border of manasses was from aser machmethath which
looketh towards sichem and it goeth out on the right hand by the
inhabitants of the fountain of taphua
for the lot of manasses took in the land of taphua which is on
the borders of manasses and belongs to the children of ephraim
and the border goeth down to the valley of the reeds to the south
of the torrent of the cities of ephraim which are in the midst of the
cities of manasses the border of manasses is on the north side of the
torrent and the outgoings of it are at the sea
so that the possession of ephraim is on the south and on the
north that of manasses and the sea is the border of both and they are
joined together in the tribe of aser on the north and in the tribe of
and the inheritance of manasses in issachar and in aser was
inhabitants of dor with the towns thereof the inhabitants also of
their villages and the third part of the city of nopheth
neither could the children of manasses overthrow these cities
but the chanaanite began to dwell in his land
but after that the children of israel were grown strong they
subdued the chanaanites and made them their tributaries and they did
not kill them
and the children of joseph spoke to josue and said why hast
thou given me but one lot and one portion to possess whereas i am of so
great a multitude and the lord hath blessed me
and josue said to them if thou be a great people go up into the
woodland and cut down room for thyself in the land of the pherezite and
the raphaims because the possession of mount ephraim is too narrow for
thee
and the children of joseph answered him we cannot go up to the
mountains for the chanaanites that dwell in the low lands wherein are
situate bethsan with its towns and jezrael in the midst of the valley
have chariots of iron
and josue said to the house of joseph to ephraim and manasses
lot only
but thou shalt pass to the mountain and shalt cut down the wood
and make thyself room to dwell in and mayst proceed farther when thou
hast destroyed the chanaanites who as thou sayest have iron chariots
and are very strong
and all the children of israel assembled together in silo and
there they set up the tabernacle of the testimony and the land was
subdued before them
but there remained seven tribes of the children of israel which
as yet had not received their possessions
and josue said to them how long are you indolent and slack and
go not in to possess the land which the lord the god of your fathers
hath given you
choose of every tribe three men that i may send them and they
may go and compass the land and mark it out according to the number of
each multitude and bring back to me what they have marked out
divide to yourselves the land into seven parts let juda be in his
bounds on the south side and the house of joseph on the north
the land in the midst between these mark ye out into seven parts
and you shall come hither to me that i may cast lots for you before the
is to say the rest of the land which is not already assigned to juda
or joseph
for the levites have no part among you but the priesthood of the
eastward which moses the servant of the lord gave them
and when the men were risen up to go to mark out the land josue
commanded them saying go round the land and mark it out and return to
me that i may cast lots for you before the lord in silo

them down in a book and they returned to josue to the camp in silo

the son of nun in the midst of them
according to the commandment of the lord the city which he asked
for thamnath saraa in mount ephraim and he built up the city and
dwelt in it
these are the possessions which eleazar the priest and josue the
son of nun and the princes of the families and of the tribes of the
children of israel distributed by lot in silo before the lord at the
door of the tabernacle of the testimony and they divided the land
and the lord spoke to josue saying speak to children of israel
and say to them
appoint cities of refuge of which i spoke to you by the hand of
that whosoever shall kill a person unawares may flee to them and
may escape the wrath of the kinsman who is the avenger of blood
and when he shall flee to one of these cities he shall stand
before the gate of the city and shall speak to the ancients of that
city such things as prove him innocent and so shall they receive him
and give him a place to dwell in
and when the avenger of blood shall pursue him they shall not
deliver him into his hands because he slew his neighbour unawares and
is not proved to have been his enemy two or three days before
and he shall dwell in that city till he stand before judgment to
give an account of his fact and till the death of the high priest who
shall be at that time then shall the manslayer return and go into his

for the strangers that dwelt among them that whosoever had killed a
person unawares might flee to them and not die by the hand of the
kinsman coveting to revenge the blood that was shed until he should
stand before the people to lay open his cause
then the princes of the families of levi came to eleazar the
priest and to josue the son of nun and to the princes of the kindreds
of all the tribes of the children of israel
and they spoke to them in silo in the land of chanaan and said

the city of arbe the father of enac which is called hebron in
the mountain of juda and the suburbs thereof round about

thereof
and jether and estemo
and holon and dabir
and ain and jeta and bethsames with their suburbs nine cities

where the number of names exceeds the number of cities

refuge and manaim and hesebon and jaser four cities with their
suburbs
all the cities of the children of merari by their families and
kindreds were twelve
so all the cities of the levites within the possession of the
children of israel were fortyeight
with their suburbs each distributed by the families
and the lord god gave to israel all the land that he had sworn to
give to their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt in it
and he gave them peace from all nations round about and none of
their enemies durst stand against them but were brought under their
dominion
not so much as one word which he had promised to perform unto
them was made void but all came to pass
their possessions they build an altar by the side of the jordan which
alarms the other tribes an embassage is sent to them to which they
give a satisfactory answer
at the same time josue called the rubenites and the gadites and
the half tribe of manasses
and said to them you have done all that moses the servant of the
neither have you left your brethren this long time until this
present day keeping the commandment of the lord your god
therefore as the lord your god hath given your brethren rest and
peace as he promised return and go to your dwellings and to the land
of your possession which moses the servant of the lord gave you beyond
the jordan
yet so that you observe attentively and in work fulfil the
commandment and the law which moses the servant of the lord commanded
you that you love the lord your god and walk in all his ways and keep
all his commandments and cleave to him and serve him with all your
heart and with all your soul
and josue blessed them and sent them away and they returned to
their dwellings
now to half the tribe of manasses moses had given a possession in
the rest of their brethren beyond the jordan to the west and when he
sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them
he said to them with much substance and riches you return to
your settlements with silver and gold brass and iron and variety of
raiment divide the prey of your enemies with your brethren
so the children of ruben and the children of gad and the half
tribe of manasses returned and parted from the children of israel in
possession which they had obtained according to the commandment of the
and when they were come to banks of the jordan in the land of
and when the children of israel had heard of it and certain
messengers brought them an account that the children of ruben and of
they all assembled in silo to go up and fight against them
and in the mean time they sent to them into the land of galaad
and ten princes with him one of every tribe
who came to the children of ruben and of gad and the half tribe
of manasses into the land of galaad and said to them
thus saith all the people of the lord what meaneth this
transgression why have you forsaken the lord the god of israel
building a sacrilegious altar and revolting from the worship of him
is it a small thing to you that you sinned with beelphegor and
the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day and many of the
people perished
and you have forsaken the lord to day and to morrow his wrath
will rage against all israel
but if you think the land of your possession to be unclean pass
over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the lord and dwell among
us only depart not from the lord and from our society by building an
altar beside the altar of the lord our god
did not achan the son of zare transgress the commandment of the
one man and would to god he alone had perished in his wickedness
and the children of ruben and of gad and of the half tribe of
the lord the most mighty god the lord the most mighty god he
knoweth and israel also shall understand if with the design of
transgression we have set up this altar let him not save us but punish
us immediately
and if we did it with that mind that we might lay upon it
holocausts and sacrifice and victims of peace offerings let him
require and judge
and not rather with this thought and design that we should say
with the lord the god of israel
the lord hath put the river jordan for a border between us and
you o ye children of ruben and ye children of gad and therefore you
have no part in the lord and by this occasion your children shall turn
away our children from the fear of the lord we therefore thought it
best
and said let us build us an altar not for holocausts nor to
offer victims
but for a testimony between us and you and our posterity and
yours that we may serve the lord and that we may have a right to offer
both holocausts and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings and that
your children to morrow may not say to our children you have no part in
the lord
and if they will say so they shall answer them behold the altar
of the lord which our fathers made not for holocausts nor for
sacrifice but for a testimony between us and you
god keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from
the lord and leave off following his steps by building an altar to
offer holocausts and sacrifices and victims beside the altar of the
and when phinees the priest and the princes of the embassage
who were with him had heard this they were satisfied and they
admitted most willingly the words of the children of ruben and gad and
of the half tribe of manasses
and phinees the priest the son of eleazar said to them now we
know that the lord is with us because you are not guilty of this
revolt and you have delivered the children of israel from the hand of
the lord
and he returned with the princes from the children of ruben and
children of israel and brought them word again
and the saying pleased all that heard it and the children of
against them and fight and destroy the land of their possession
and the children of ruben and the children of gad called the
altar which they had built our testimony that the lord is god
to avoid marriages and all society with the gentiles for fear of being
brought to idolatry
and when a long time was passed after that the lord had given
peace to israel all the nations round about being subdued and josue
being now old and far advanced in years
josue called for all israel and for the elders and for the
princes and for the judges and for the masters and said to them i am
old and far advanced in years
and you see all that the lord your god hath done to all the
nations round about how he himself hath fought for you
and now since he hath divided to you by lot all the land from the
east of the jordan unto the great sea ant many nations yet remain
the lord your god will destroy them and take them away from
before your face and you shall possess the land as he hath promised
you
only take courage and be careful to observe all things that are
written in the book of the law of moses and turn not aside from them
neither to the right hand nor to the left
lest after that you are come in among the gentiles who will
remain among you you should swear by the name of their gods and serve
them and adore them
but cleave ye unto the lord your god as you have done until this
day
and then the lord god will take away before your eyes nations that
are great and very strong and no man shall be able to resist you
one of you shall chase a thousand men of the enemies because the
this only take care of with all diligence that you love the lord
your god
but if you will embrace the errors of these nations that dwell
among you and make marriages with them and join friendships
know ye for a certainty that the lord your god will not destroy
them before your face but they shall be a pit and a snare in your way
and a stumblingblock at your side and stakes in your eyes till he
take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land which he
hath given you
behold this day i am going into the way of all the earth and you
shall know with all your mind that of all the words which the lord
promised to perform for you not one hath failed
therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed what he promised and all
things prosperous have come so will he bring upon you all the evils he
hath threatened till he take you away and destroy you from off this
excellent land which he hath given you
when you shall have transgressed the covenant of the lord your
and adored them then shall the indignation of the lord rise up quickly
and speedily against you and you shall be taken away from this
excellent land which he hath delivered to you
and josue gathered together all the tribes of israel in sichem
and called for the ancients and the princes and the judges and the
masters and they stood in the sight of the lord
and he spoke thus to the people thus saith the lord the god of
the father of abraham and nachor and they served strange gods
and i took your father abraham from the borders of mesopotamia
and brought him into the land of chanaan and i multiplied his seed
and gave him isaac and to him again i gave jacob and esau and i
gave to esau mount seir for his possession but jacob and his children
went down into egypt
and i sent moses and aaron and i struck egypt with many signs and
wonders
and i brought you and your fathers out of egypt and you came to
the sea and the egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and
horsemen as far as the red sea
and the children of israel cried to the lord and he put darkness
between you and the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and
covered them your eyes saw all that i did in egypt and you dwelt in
the wilderness a long time
and i brought you into the land of the amorrhite who dwelt beyond
the jordan and when they fought against you i delivered them into your
hands and you possessed their land and slew them
and balac son of sephor king of moab arose and fought against
and i would not hear him but on the contrary i blessed you by
him and i delivered you out of his hand
and you passed over the jordan and you came to jericho and the
men of that city fought against you the amorrhite and the pherezite
and the chanaanite and the hethite and the gergesite and the hevite
and the jebusite and i delivered them into your hands
and i sent before you and i drove them out from their places the
two kings of the amorrhites not with thy sword nor with thy bow
and i gave you a land in which you had not laboured and cities
to dwell in which you built not vineyards and oliveyards which you
planted not
now therefore fear the lord and serve him with a perfect and
most sincere heart and put away the gods which your fathers served in
but if it seem evil to you to serve the lord you have your
choice choose this day that which pleaseth you whom you would rather
serve whether the gods which your fathers served in mesopotamia or the
gods of the amorrhites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my
house we will serve thee lord
and the people answered and said god forbid we should leave the
the lord our god he brought us and our fathers out of the land of
sight and preserved us in all the way by which we journeyed and among
all the people through whom we passed
and he hath cast out all the nations the amorrhite the
inhabitant of the land into which we are come therefore we will serve
the lord for he is our god
and josue said to the people you will not be able to serve the
your wickedness and sins
of discouraging them but rather to make them more earnest and resolute
by setting before them the greatness of the undertaking and the courage
and constancy necessary to go through with it
if you leave the lord and serve strange gods he will turn and
will afflict you and will destroy you after all the good he hath done
you
and the people said to josue no it shall not be so as thou
sayest but we will serve the lord
and josue said to the people you are witnesses that you
yourselves have chosen you the lord to serve him and they answered we
are witnesses
now therefore said he put away strange gods from among you and
incline your hearts to the lord the god of israel
and the people said to josue we will serve the lord our god and
we will be obedient to his commandments
josue therefore on that day made a covenant and set before the
people commandments and judgments in sichem
and he wrote all these things in the volume of the law of the
the sanctuary of the lord
and he said to all the people behold this stone shall be a
testimony unto you that it hath heard all the words of the lord which
he hath spoken to you lest perhaps hereafter you will deny it and lie
to the lord your god
attributed to inanimate things and they are called upon as it were to
bear witness in favour of the great creator whom they on their part
constantly obey
and he sent the people away every one to their own possession
and after these things josue the son of nun the servant of the
these last verses were added by samuel or some other prophet
and they buried him in the border of his possession in
mount gaas
and israel served the lord all the days of josue and of the
ancients that lived a long time after josue and that had known all the
works of the lord which he had done in israel
and the bones of joseph which the children of israel had taken
out of egypt they buried in sichem in that part of the field which
hundred young ewes and it was in the possession of the sons of joseph
eleazar also the son of aaron died and they buried him in
passed under the government of the judges who ruled israel before they
had kings the writer of it according to the more general opinion was
the prophet samuel
