all wisdom is from the lord god and hath been always with him and
is before all time
who hath numbered the sand of the sea and the drops of rain and
the days of the world who hath measured the height of heaven and the
breadth of the earth and the depth of the abyss
who hath searched out the wisdom of god that goeth before all
things
wisdom hath been created before all things and the understanding
of prudence from everlasting
the word of god on high is the fountain of wisdom and her ways are
everlasting commandments
to whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed and who hath known
her wise counsels
to whom hath the discipline of wisdom been revealed and made
manifest and who hath understood the multiplicity of her steps
there is one most high creator almighty and a powerful king and
greatly to be feared who sitteth upon his throne and is the god of
dominion
he created her in the holy ghost and saw her and numbered her
and measured her
and he poured her out upon all his works and upon all flesh
according to his gift and hath given her to them that love him
the fear of the lord is honour and glory and gladness and a
crown of joy
the fear of the lord shall delight the heart and shall give joy
and gladness and length of days
with him that feareth the lord it shall go well in the latter
end and in the day of his death he shall be blessed
the love of god is honourable wisdom
and they to whom she shall shew herself love her by the sight and
by the knowledge of her great works
the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and was created
with the faithful in the womb it walketh with chosen women and is
known with the just and faithful
the fear of the lord is the religiousness of knowledge
religiousness shall keep and justify the heart it shall give joy
and gladness
it shall go well with him that feareth the lord and in the days
of his end he shall be blessed
to fear god is the fulness of wisdom and fulness is from the
fruits thereof
she shall fill all her house with her increase and the
storehouses with her treasures
the fear of the lord is a crown of wisdom filling up peace and
the fruit of salvation
and it hath seen and numbered her but both are the gifts of god
wisdom shall distribute knowledge and understanding of prudence
and exalteth the glory of them that hold her
the root of wisdom is to fear the lord and the branches thereof
are longlived
in the treasures of wisdom is understanding and religiousness of
knowledge but to sinners wisdom is an abomination
the fear of the lord driveth out sin
for he that is without fear cannot be justified for the wrath of
his high spirits is his ruin
a patient man shall bear for a time and afterwards joy shall be
restored to him
a good understanding will hide his words for a time and the lips
of many shall declare his wisdom
in the treasures of wisdom is the signification of discipline
but the worship of god is an abomination to a sinner
son if thou desire wisdom keep justice and god will give her to
thee
for the fear of the lord is wisdom and discipline and that which
is agreeable to him
is faith and meekness and he will fill up his treasures
be not incredulous to the fear of the lord and come not to him
with a double heart
be not a hypocrite in the sight of men and let not thy lips be a
stumblingblock to thee
watch over them lest thou fall and bring dishonour upon thy
soul
and god discover thy secrets and cast thee down in the midst of
the congregation
because thou camest to the lord wickedly and thy heart is full of
guile and deceit
patience and confidence in god
son when thou comest to the service of god stand in justice and
in fear and prepare thy soul for temptation
humble thy heart and endure incline thy ear and receive the
words of understanding and make not haste in the time of clouds
wait on god with patience join thyself to god and endure that
thy life may be increased in the latter end
take all that shall be brought upon thee and in thy sorrow endure
and in thy humiliation keep patience
for gold and silver are tried in the fire but acceptable men in
the furnace of humiliation
believe god and he will recover thee and direct thy way and
trust in him keep his fear and grow old therein
ye that fear the lord wait for his mercy and go not aside from
him lest ye fall
ye that fear the lord believe him and your reward shall not be
made void
ye that fear the lord hope in him and mercy shall come to you for
your delight
ye that fear the lord love him and your hearts shall be
enlightened
my children behold the generations of men and know ye that no one
hath hoped in the lord and hath been confounded
for who hath continued in his commandment and hath been forsaken
or who hath called upon him and he despised him
for god is compassionate and merciful and will forgive sins in
the day of tribulation and he is a protector to all that seek him in
truth
woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips and to
the hands that do evil and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two
ways
woe to them that are fainthearted who believe not god and
therefore they shall not be protected by him
woe to them that have lost patience and that have forsaken the
right ways and have gone aside into crooked ways
and what will they do when the lord shall begin to examine
they that fear the lord will not be incredulous to his word and
they that love him will keep his way
they that fear the lord will seek after the things that are well
pleasing to him and they that love him shall be filled with his law
they that fear the lord will prepare their hearts and in his
sight will sanctify their souls
they that fear the lord keep his commandments and will have
patience even until his visitation
saying if we do not penance we shall fall into the hands of the
for according to his greatness so also is his mercy with him
curiosity
the sons of wisdom are the church of the just and their
generation obedience and love
children hear the judgment of your father and so do that you may
be saved
for god hath made the father honourable to the children and
seeking the judgment of the mothers hath confirmed it upon the
children
he that loveth god shall obtain pardon for his sins by prayer and
shall refrain himself from them and shall be heard in the prayer of
days
and he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a
treasure
he that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children
and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard
he that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life and he that
obeyeth the father shall be a comfort to his mother
he that feareth the lord honoureth his parents and will serve
them as his masters that brought him into the world
honour thy father in work and word and all patience
that a blessing may come upon thee from him and his blessing may
remain in the latter end
the fathers blessing establisheth the houses of the children but
the mothers curse rooteth up the foundation
glory not in the dishonour of thy father for his shame is no
glory to thee
for the glory of a man is from the honour of his father and a
father without honour is the disgrace of the son
son support the old age of thy father and grieve him not in his
life
and if his understanding fail have patience with him and despise
him not when thou art in thy strength for the relieving of the father
shall not be forgotten
for good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother
and in justice thou shalt be built up and in the day of
affliction thou shalt be remembered and thy sins shall melt away as the
ice in the fair warm weather
of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father and he is
cursed of god that angereth his mother
my son do thy works in meekness and thou shalt be beloved above
the glory of men
the greater thou art the more humble thyself in all things and
thou shalt find grace before god
for great is the power of god alone and he is honoured by the
humble
seek not the things that are too high for thee and search not
into things above thy ability but the things that god hath commanded
thee think on them always and in many of his works be not curious
for it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things
that are hid
in unnecessary matters be not over curious and in many of his
works thou shalt not be inquisitive
for many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men
and the suspicion of them hath deceived many and hath detained
their minds in vanity
a hard heart shall fear evil at the last and he that loveth
danger shall perish in it
a heart that goeth two ways shall not have success and the
perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein
a wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows and the sinner will
add sin to sin
the congregation of the proud shall not be healed for the plant
of wickedness shall take root in them and it shall not be perceived
the heart of the wise is understood in wisdom and a good ear will
hear wisdom with all desire
a wise heart and which hath understanding will abstain from
sins and in the works of justice shall have success
water quencheth a flaming fire and alms resisteth sins
and god provideth for him that sheweth favour he remembereth him
afterwards and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay
son defraud not the poor of alms and turn not away thy eyes from
the poor
despise not the hungry soul and provoke not the poor in his want
afflict not the heart of the needy and defer not to gibe to him
that is in distress
reject not the petition of the afflicted and turn not away thy
face from the needy
turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger and leave
not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back
for the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his
soul shall be heard for he that made him will hear him
make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor and humble
thy soul to the ancient and bow thy head to a great man
bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor and pay what thou owest
and answer him peaceable words with mildness
deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud and
be not fainthearted in thy soul
in judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father and as a
husband to their mother
and thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most high and he
will have mercy on thee more than a mother
wisdom inspireth life into her children and protecteth them that
seek after her and will go before them in the way of justice
and he that loveth her loveth life and they that watch for her
shall embrace her sweetness
they that hold her fast shall inherit life and whithersoever she
entereth god will give a blessing
they that serve her shall be servants to the holy one and god
loveth them that love her
he that hearkeneth to her shall judge nations and he that
looketh upon her shall remain secure
if he trust to her he shall inherit her and his generation shall
be in assurance
for she walketh with him in temptation and at the first she
chooseth him
for her favourite she will try them by leading them through
contradictions afflictions and temptations the usual noviceship of
the children of god
she will bring upon him fear and dread and trial and she will
scourge him with the affliction of her discipline till she try him by
her laws and trust his soul
then she will strengthen him and make a straight way to him and
give him joy
and will disclose her secrets to him and will heap upon him
treasures of knowledge and understanding of justice
but if he go astray she will forsake him and deliver him into
the hands of his enemy
son observe the time and fly from evil
for thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth
for there is a shame that bringeth sin and there is a shame that
bringeth glory and grace
accept no person against thy own person nor against thy soul a
lie
reverence not thy neighbour in his fall
and refrain not to speak in the time of salvation hide not thy
wisdom in her beauty
for by the tongue wisdom is discerned and understanding and
knowledge and learning by the word of the wise and steadfastness in
the works of justice
in nowise speak against the truth but be ashamed of the lie of
thy ignorance
be not ashamed to confess thy sins but submit not thyself to
every man for sin
resist not against the face of the mighty and do not strive
against the stream of the river
strive for justice for thy soul and even unto death fight for
justice and god will overthrow thy enemies for thee
be not hasty in thy tongue and slack and remiss in thy works
be not as a lion in thy house terrifying them of thy household
and oppressing them that are under thee
let not thy hand be stretched out to receive and shut when thou
shouldst give
to go on in sin we must be steadfast in virtue and truth
set not thy heart upon unjust possessions and say not i have
enough to live on for it shall be of no service in the time of
vengeance and darkness
follow not in thy strength the desires of thy heart
and say not how mighty am i and who shall bring me under for my
deeds for god will surely take revenge
say not i have sinned and what harm hath befallen me for the
most high is a patient rewarder
be not without fear about sin forgiven and add not sin upon sin
and say not the mercy of the lord is great he will have mercy on
the multitude of my sins
for mercy and wrath quickly come from him and his wrath looketh
upon sinners
delay not to be converted to the lord and defer it not from day to
day
for his wrath shall come on a sudden and in the time of vengeance
he will destroy thee
be not anxious for goods unjustly gotten for they shall not
profit thee in the day of calamity and revenge
winnow not with every wind and go not into every way for so is
every sinner proved by a double tongue
be steadfast in the way of the lord and in the truth of thy
judgment and in knowledge and let the word of peace and justice keep
with thee
be meek to hear the word that thou mayst understand and return a
true answer with wisdom
if thou have understanding answer thy neighbour but if not let
thy hand be upon thy mouth lest thou be surprised in an unskilful word
and be confounded
honour and glory is in the word of the wise but the tongue of the
fool is his ruin
be not called a whisperer and be not taken in thy tongue and
confounded
for confusion and repentance is upon a thief and an evil mark of
disgrace upon the double tongued but to the whisperer hatred and
enmity and reproach
justify alike the small and the great
instead of a friend become not an enemy to thy neighbour for an
evil man shall inherit reproach and shame so shall every sinner that is
envious and double tongued
extol not thyself in the thoughts of thy soul like a bull lest thy
strength be quashed by folly
and it eat up thy leaves and destroy thy fruit and thou be left
as a dry tree in the wilderness
for a wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it and maketh him to
be a joy to his enemies and shall lead him into the lot of the wicked
a sweet word multiplieth friends and appeaseth enemies and a
gracious tongue in a good man aboundeth
be in peace with many but let one of a thousand be thy counsellor
if thou wouldst get a friend try him before thou takest him and
do not credit him easily
for there is a friend for his own occasion and he will not abide
in the day of thy trouble
and there is a friend that turneth to enmity and there is a friend
that will disclose hatred and strife and reproaches
and there is a friend a companion at the table and he will not
abide in the day of distress
a friend if he continue steadfast shall be to thee as thyself
and shall act with confidence among them of thy household
if he humble himself before thee and hide himself from thy face
thou shalt have unanimous friendship for good
separate thyself from thy enemies and take heed of thy friends
a faithful friend is a strong defence and he that hath found him
hath found a treasure
nothing can be compared to a faithful friend and no weight of
gold and silver is able to countervail the goodness of his fidelity
a faithful friend is the medicine of life and immortality and
they that fear the lord shall find him
he that feareth god shall likewise have good friendship because
according to him shall his friend be
my son from thy youth up receive instruction and even to thy
grey hairs thou shalt find wisdom
come to her as one that plougheth and soweth and wait for her
good fruits
for in working about her thou shalt labour a little and shalt
quickly eat of her fruits
how very unpleasant is wisdom to the unlearned and the unwise
will not continue with her
she shall be to them as a mighty stone of trial and they will
cast her from them before it be long
for the wisdom of doctrine is according to her name and she is
not manifest unto many but with them to whom she is known she
continueth even to the sight of god
give ear my son and take wise counsel and cast not away my
advice
put thy feet into her fetters and thy neck into her chains
bow down thy shoulder and bear her and be not grieved with her
bands
come to her with all thy mind and keep her ways with all thy
power
search for her and she shall be made known to thee and when thou
hast gotten her let her not go
for in the latter end thou shalt find rest in her and she shall
be turned to thy joy
then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee and a firm
foundation and her chain a robe of glory
for in her is the beauty of life and her bands are a healthful
binding
thou shalt put her on as a robe of glory and thou shalt set her
upon thee as a crown of joy
my son if thou wilt attend to me thou shalt learn and if thou
wilt apply thy mind thou shalt be wise
if thou wilt incline thy ear thou shalt receive instruction and
if thou love to hear thou shalt be wise
stand in the multitude of ancients that are wise and join thyself
from thy heart to their wisdom that thou mayst hear every discourse of
and if thou see a man of understanding go to him early in the
morning and let thy foot wear the steps of his doors
let thy thoughts be upon the precepts of god and meditate
continually on his commandments and he will give thee a heart and the
desire of wisdom shall be given to thee
do no evils and no evils shall lay hold of thee
depart from the unjust and evils shall depart from thee
my son sow not evils in the furrows of injustice and thou shalt
not reap them sevenfold
seek not of the lord a preeminence nor of the king the seat of
honour
justify not thyself before god for he knoweth the heart and
desire not to appear wise before the king
seek not to be made a judge unless thou have strength enough to
extirpate iniquities lest thou fear the person of the powerful and lay
a stumblingblock for thy integrity
offend not against the multitude of a city neither cast thyself in
upon the people
nor bind sin to sin for even in one thou shalt not be unpunished
be not fainthearted in thy mind
neglect not to pray and to give alms
say not god will have respect to the multitude of my gifts and
when i offer to the most high god he will accept my offerings
laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul for there is
one that humbleth and exalteth god who seeth all
devise not a lie against thy brother neither do the like against
thy friend
be not willing to make any manner of lie for the custom thereof
is not good
be not full of words in a multitude of ancients and repeat not
the word in thy prayer
aim more at fervour of heart
hate not laborious works nor husbandry ordained by the most high
number not thyself among the multitude of the disorderly
remember wrath for it will not tarry long
humble thy spirit very much for the vengeance on the flesh of the
ungodly is fire and worms
do not transgress against thy friend deferring money nor despise
thy dear brother for the sake of gold
depart not from a wise and good wife whom thou hast gotten in the
fear of the lord for the grace of her modesty is above gold
hurt not the servant that worketh faithfully nor the hired man
that giveth thee his life
let a wise servant be dear to thee as thy own soul defraud him
not of liberty nor leave him needy
hast thou cattle have an eye to them and if they be for thy
profit keep them with thee
hast thou children instruct them and bow down their neck from
their childhood
hast thou daughters have a care of their body and shew not thy
countenance gay towards them
marry thy daughter well and thou shalt do a great work and give
her to a wise man
if thou hast a wife according to thy soul cast her not off and
to her that is hateful trust not thyself with thy whole heart
honour thy father and forget not the groanings of thy mother
remember that thou hadst not been born but through them and make
a return to them as they have done for thee
with all thy soul fear the lord and reverence his priests
with all thy strength love him that made thee and forsake not his
ministers
honour god with all thy soul and give honour to the priests and
purify thyself with thy arms
here signified the right shoulders of the victims which by the law fell
to the priests see ver
give them their portion as it is commanded thee of the
firstfruits and of purifications and for thy negligences purify thyself
with a few
offer to the lord the gift of thy shoulders and the sacrifice of
sanctification and the firstfruits of the holy things
and stretch out thy hand to the poor that thy expiation and thy
blessing may be perfected
a gift hath grace in the sight of all the living and restrain not
grace from the dead
the benefit of alms prayers and sacrifices such was the doctrine and
practice of the church of god even in the time of the old testament and
the same has always been continued from the days of the apostles in the
church of the new testament
be not wanting in comforting them that weep and walk with them
that mourn
be not slow to visit the sick for by these things thou shalt be
confirmed in love
in all thy works remember thy last end and thou shalt never sin
strive not with a powerful man lest thou fall into his hands
contend not with a rich man lest he bring an action against thee
for gold and silver hath destroyed many and hath reached even to
the heart of kings and perverted them
strive not with a man that is full of tongue and heap not wood
upon his fire
communicate not with an ignorant man lest he speak ill of thy
family
despise not a man that turneth away from sin nor reproach him
therewith remember that we are all worthy of reproof
despise not a man in his old age for we also shall become old
rejoice not at the death of thy enemy knowing that we all die and
are not willing that others should rejoice at our death
despise not the discourse of them that are ancient and wise but
acquaint thyself with their proverbs
for of them thou shalt learn wisdom and instruction of
understanding and to serve great men without blame
let not the discourse of the ancients escape thee for they have
learned of their fathers
for of them thou shalt learn understanding and to give an answer
in time of need
kindle not the coals of sinners by rebuking them lest thou be
burnt with the flame of the fire of their sins
stand not against the face of an injurious person lest he sit as
a spy to entrap thee in thy words
lend not to a man that is mightier than thyself and if thou
lendest count it as lost
be not surety above thy power and if thou be surety think as if
thou wert to pay it
judge not against a judge for he judgeth according to that which
is just
go not on the way with a bold man lest he burden thee with his
evils for he goeth according to his own will and thou shalt perish
together with his folly
quarrel not with a passionate man and go not into the desert with
a bold man for blood is as nothing in his sight and where there is no
help he will overthrow thee
advise not with fools for they cannot love but such things as
please them
before a stranger do no matter of counsel for thou knowest not
what he will bring forth
open not thy heart to every man lest he repay thee with an evil
turn and speak reproachfully to thee
be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom lest she shew in thy
regard the malice of a wicked lesson
give not the power of thy soul to a woman lest she enter upon thy
strength and thou be confounded
look not upon a woman that hath a mind for many lest thou fall
into her snares
use not much the company of her that is a dancer and hearken not
to her lest thou perish by the force of her charms
gaze not upon a maiden lest her beauty be a stumblingblock to
thee
give not thy soul to harlots in any point lest thou destroy
thyself and thy inheritance
look not round about thee in the ways of the city nor wander up
and down in the streets thereof
turn away thy face from a woman dressed up and gaze not about upon
anothers beauty
for many have perished by the beauty of a woman and hereby lust is
enkindled as a fire
every woman that is a harlot shall be trodden upon as dung in the
way
many by admiring the beauty of another mans wife have become
reprobate for her conversation burneth as fire
sit not at all with another mans wife nor repose upon the bed
with her
and strive not with her over wine lest thy heart decline towards
her and by thy blood thou fall into destruction
forsake not an old friend for the new will not be like to him
a new friend is as new wine it shall grow old and thou shalt
drink it with pleasure
envy not the glory and riches of a sinner for thou knowest not
what his ruin shall be
be not pleased with the wrong done by the unjust knowing that
even to hell the wicked shall not please
keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill so thou shalt
not suspect the fear of death
and if thou come to him commit no fault lest he take away thy
life
know it to be a communication with death for thou art going in
the midst of snares and walking upon the arms of them that are grieved
according to thy power beware of thy neighbour and treat with the
wise and prudent
let just men be thy guests and let thy glory be in the fear of
and let the thought of god be in thy mind and all thy discourse
on the commandments of the highest
works shall be praised for the hand of the artificers and the
prince of the people for the wisdom of his speech but the word of the
ancients for the sense
a man full of tongue is terrible in his city and he that is rash
in his word shall be hateful
a wise judge shall judge his people and the government of a
prudent man shall be steady
as the judge of the people is himself so also are his ministers
and what manner of man the ruler of a city is such also are they that
dwell therein
an unwise king shall be the ruin of his people and cities shall
be inhabited through the prudence of the rulers
the power of the earth is in the hand of god and in his time he
will raise up a profitable ruler over it
the prosperity of man is in the hand of god and upon the person
of the scribe he shall lay his honour
remember not any injury done thee by thy neighbour and do thou
nothing by deeds of injury
pride is hateful before god and men and all iniquity of nations
is execrable
a kingdom is translated from one people to another because of
injustices and wrongs and injuries and divers deceits
but nothing is more wicked than the covetous man why is earth
and ashes proud
there is not a more wicked thing than to love money for such a
one setteth even his own soul to sale because while he liveth he hath
cast away his bowels
all power is of short life a long sickness is troublesome to the
physician
the physician cutteth off a short sickness so also a king is to
day and to morrow he shall die
for when a man shall die he shall inherit serpents and beasts
and worms
the beginning of the pride of man is to fall off from god
because his heart is departed from him that made him for pride
is the beginning of all sin he that holdeth it shall be filled with
maledictions and it shall ruin him in the end
therefore hath the lord disgraced the assemblies of the wicked
and hath utterly destroyed them
god hath overturned the thrones of proud princes and hath set up
the meek in their stead
god hath made the roots of proud nations to wither and hath
planted the humble of these nations
the lord hath overthrown the lands of the gentiles and hath
destroyed them even to the foundation
he hath made some of them to wither away and hath destroyed
them and hath made the memory of them to cease from the earth
god hath abolished the memory of the proud and hath preserved
the memory of them that are humble in mind
pride was not made for men nor wrath for the race of women
that seed of men shall be honoured which feareth god but that
seed shall be dishonoured which transgresseth the commandments of the
in the midst of brethren their chief is honourable so shall they
that fear the lord be in his eyes
the fear of god is the glory of the rich and of the honourable
and of the poor
despise not a just man that is poor and do not magnify a sinful
man that is rich
the great man and the judge and the mighty is in honour and
there is none greater than he that feareth god
they that are free shall serve a servant that is wise and a man
that is prudent and well instructed will not murmur when he is reproved
and he that is ignorant shall not be honoured
extol not thyself in doing thy work and linger not in the time
of distress
better is he that laboureth and aboundeth in all things than he
that boasteth himself and wanteth bread
my son keep thy soul in meekness and give it honour according
to its desert
who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul and who
will honour him that dishonoureth his own soul
the poor man is glorified by his discipline and fear and there
is a man that is honoured for his wealth
but he that is glorified in poverty how much more in wealth and
he that is glorified in wealth let him fear poverty
the wisdom of the humble shall exalt his head and shall make him
sit in the midst of great men
praise not a man for his beauty neither despise a man for his
look
the bee is small among flying things but her fruit hath the
chiefest sweetness
glory not in apparel at any time and be not exalted in the day of
thy honour for the works of the highest only are wonderful and his
works are glorious and secret and hidden
many tyrants have sat on the throne and he whom no man would
think on hath worn the crown
many mighty men have been greatly brought down and the glorious
have been delivered into the hand of others
before thou inquire blame no man and when thou hast inquired
reprove justly
before thou hear answer not a word and interrupt not others in
the midst of their discourse
strive not in a matter which doth not concern thee and sit not in
judgment with sinners
my son meddle not with many matters and if thou be rich thou
shalt not be free from sin for if thou pursue after thou shalt not
overtake and if thou run before thou shalt not escape
there is an ungodly man that laboureth and maketh haste and is
in sorrow and is so much the more in want
again there is an inactive man that wanteth help is very weak
in ability and full of poverty
yet the eye of god hath looked upon him for good and hath lifted
him up from his low estate and hath exalted his head and many have
wondered at him and have glorified god
good things and evil life and death poverty and riches are
from god
wisdom and discipline and the knowledge of the law are with god
error and darkness are created with sinners and they that glory
in evil things grow old in evil
the gift of god abideth with the just and his advancement shall
have success for ever
there is one that is enriched by living sparingly and this is
the portion of his reward
in that he saith i have found me rest and now i will eat of my
goods alone
and he knoweth not what time shall pass and that death
approacheth and that he must leave all to others and shall die
be steadfast in thy covenant and be conversant therein and grow
old in the work of thy commandments
abide not in the works of sinners but trust in god and stay in
thy place
for it is easy in the eyes of god on a sudden to make the poor
man rich
the blessing of god maketh haste to reward the just and in a
swift hour his blessing beareth fruit
say not what need i and what good shall i have by this
say not i am sufficient for myself and what shall i be made
worse by this
in the day of good things be not unmindful of evils and in the
day of evils be not unmindful of good things
for it is easy before god in the day of death to reward every one
according to his ways
the affliction of an hour maketh one forget great delights and
in the end of a man is the disclosing of his works
praise not any man before death for a man is known by his
children
bring not every man into thy house for many are the snares of
the deceitful
for as corrupted bowels send forth stinking breath and as the
partridge is brought into the cage and as the roe into the snare so
also is the heart of the proud and as a spy that looketh on the fall of
his neighbour
for he lieth in wait and turneth good into evil and on the elect
he will lay a blot
of one spark cometh a great fire and of one deceitful man much
blood and a sinful man lieth in wait for blood
take heed to thyself of a mischievous man for he worketh evils
lest he bring upon thee reproach for ever
receive a stranger in and he shall overthrow thee with a
whirlwind and shall turn thee out of thy own
if thou do good know to whom thou dost it and there shall be
much thanks for thy good deeds
do good to the just and thou shalt find great recompense and if
not of him assuredly of the lord
for there is no good for him that is always occupied in evil and
that giveth no alms for the highest hateth sinners and hath mercy on
the penitent
give to the merciful and uphold not the sinner god will repay
vengeance to the ungodly and to sinners and keep them against the day
of vengeance
give to the good and receive not a sinner
do good to the humble and give not to the ungodly hold back thy
bread and give it not to him lest thereby he overmaster thee
for thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou
shalt have done to him for the highest also hateth sinners and will
repay vengeance to the ungodly
a friend shall not be known in prosperity and an enemy shall not
be hidden in adversity
in the prosperity of a man his enemies are grieved and a friend
is known in his adversity
never trust thy enemy for as a brass pot his wickedness rusteth
though he humble himself and go crouching yet take good heed and
beware of him
set him not by thee neither let him sit on thy right hand lest
he turn into thy place and seek to take thy seat and at the last thou
acknowledge my words and be pricked with my sayings
who will pity an enchanter struck by a serpent or any that come
near wild beasts so is it with him that keepeth company with a wicked
man and is involved in his sins
for an hour he will abide with thee but if thou begin to
decline he will not endure it
an enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips but in his heart he
lieth in wait to throw thee into a pit
an enemy weepeth with his eyes but if he find an opportunity he
will not be satisfied with blood
and if evils come upon thee thou shalt find him there first
an enemy hath tears in his eyes and while he pretendeth to help
thee will undermine thy feet
he will shake his head and clap his hands and whisper much and
change his countenance
he that toucheth pitch shall be defiled with it and he that hath
fellowship with the proud shall put on pride
he shall take a burden upon him that hath fellowship with one more
honourable than himself and have no fellowship with one that is richer
than thyself
what agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle for if
they knock one against the other it shall be broken
the rich man hath done wrong and yet he will fume but the poor
is wronged and must hold his peace
if thou give he will make use of thee and if thou have nothing
he will forsake thee
if thou have any thing he will live with thee and will make thee
bare and he will not be sorry for thee
if he have need of thee he will deceive thee and smiling upon
thee will put thee in hope he will speak thee fair and will say what
wantest thou
and he will shame thee by his meats till he have drawn thee dry
twice or thrice and at last he will laugh at thee and afterward when
he seeth thee he will forsake thee and shake his head at thee
humble thyself to god and wait for his hands
beware that thou be not deceived into folly and be humbled
be not lowly in thy wisdom lest being humbled thou be deceived
into folly
if thou be invited by one that is mightier withdraw thyself for
so he will invite thee the more
be not troublesome to him lest thou be put back and keep not
far from him lest thou be forgotten
affect not to speak with him as an equal and believe not his
many words for by much talk he will sift thee and smiling will examine
thee concerning thy secrets
his cruel mind will lay up thy words and he will not spare to do
thee hurt and to cast thee into prison
take heed to thyself and attend diligently to what thou hearest
for thou walkest in danger of thy ruin
when thou hearest those things see as it were in sleep and thou
shalt awake
love god all thy life and call upon him for thy salvation
every beast loveth its like so also every man him that is
nearest to himself
all flesh shall consort with the like to itself and every man
shall associate himself to his like
if the wolf shall at any time have fellowship with the lamb so
the sinner with the just
what fellowship hath a holy man with a dog or what part hath the
rich with the poor
the wild ass is the lions prey in the desert so also the poor
are devoured by the rich
and as humility is an abomination to the proud so also the rich
man abhorreth the poor
when a rich man is shaken he is kept up by his friends but when
a poor man is fallen down he is thrust away even by his acquaintance
when a rich man hath been deceived he hath many helpers he hath
spoken proud things and they have justified him
the poor man was deceived and he is rebuked also he hath spoken
wisely and could have no place
the rich man spoke and all held their peace and what he said
they extol even to the clouds
the poor man spoke and they say who is this and if he stumble
they will overthrow him
riches are good to him that hath no sin in his conscience and
poverty is very wicked in the mouth of the ungodly
the heart of a man changeth his countenance either for good or
for evil
the token of a good heart and a good countenance thou shalt
hardly find and with labour
wisdom
blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of his
mouth and is not pricked with the remorse of sin
happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind and who is not
fallen from his hope
riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard and what
should an envious man do with gold
he that gathereth together by wronging his own soul gathereth for
others and another will squander away his goods in rioting
he that is evil to himself to whom will he be good and he shall
not take pleasure in his goods
there is none worse than he that envieth himself and this is the
reward of his wickedness
and if he do good he doth it ignorantly and unwillingly and at
the last he discovereth his wickedness
the eye of the envious is wicked and he turneth away his face
and despiseth his own soul
the eye of the covetous man is insatiable in his portion of
iniquity he will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul drying
it up
an evil eye is towards evil things and he shall not have his
fill of bread but shall be needy and pensive at his own table
my son if thou have any thing do good to thyself and offer to
remember that death is not slow and that the covenant of hell
hath been shewn to thee for the covenant of this world shall surely
die
regions of death
do good to thy friend before thou die and according to thy
ability stretching out thy hand give to the poor
defraud not thyself of the good day and let not the part of a
good gift overpass thee
shalt thou not leave to others to divide by lot thy sorrows and
labours
give and take and justify thy soul
before thy death work justice for in hell there is no finding
food
all flesh shall fade as grass and as the leaf that springeth out
on a green tree
some grow and some fall off so is the generation of flesh and
blood one cometh to an end and another is born
every work that is corruptible shall fail in the end and the
worker thereof shall go with it
and every excellent work shall be justified and the worker
thereof shall be honoured therein
blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom and that shall
meditate in his justice and in his mind shall think of the all seeing
eye of god
he that considereth her ways in his heart and hath understanding
in her secrets who goeth after her as one that traceth and stayeth in
her ways
he who looketh in at her windows and hearkeneth at her door
he that lodgeth near her house and fastening a pin in her walls
shall set up his tent high unto her where good things shall rest in his
lodging for ever
he shall set his children under her shelter and shall lodge
under her branches
he shall be protected under her covering from the heat and shall
rest in her glory
he that feareth god will do good and he that possesseth justice
shall lay hold on her
and she will meet him as an honourable mother and will receive
him as a wife married of a virgin
with the bread of life and understanding she shall feed him and
give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink and she shall be made
strong in him and he shall not be moved
and she shall hold him fast and he shall not be confounded and
she shall exalt him among his neighbours
and in the midst of the church she shall open his mouth and shall
fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding and shall clothe
him with a robe of glory
she shall heap upon him a treasure of joy and gladness and shall
cause him to inherit an everlasting name
but foolish men shall not obtain her and wise men shall meet her
foolish men shall not see her for she is far from pride and deceit
lying men shall be mindful of her but men that speak truth shall
be found with her and shall advance even till they come to the sight
of god
praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner
for wisdom came forth from god for praise shall be with the
wisdom of god and shall abound in a faithful mouth and the sovereign
say not it is through god that she is not with me for do not
thou the things that he hateth
say not he hath caused me to err for he hath no need of wicked
men
the lord hateth all abomination of error and they that fear him
shall not love it
god made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his
own counsel
he added his commandments and precepts
if thou wilt keep the commandments and perform acceptable
fidelity for ever they shall preserve thee
he hath set water and fire before thee stretch forth thy hand to
which thou wilt
before man is life and death good and evil that which he shall
choose shall be given him
for the wisdom of god is great and he is strong in power seeing
all men without ceasing
the eyes of the lord are towards them that fear him and he
knoweth al the work of man
he hath commanded no man to do wickedly and he hath given no man
license to sin
for he desireth not a multitude of faithless and unprofitable
children
mercy of god his ways are unsearchable
rejoice not in ungodly children if they be multiplied neither be
delighted in them if the fear of god be not with them
trust not to their life and respect not their labours
for better is one that feareth god than a thousand ungodly
children
and it is better to die without children than to leave ungodly
children
by one that is wise a country shall be inhabited the tribe of the
ungodly shall become desolate
many such things hath my eyes seen and greater things than these
my ear hath heard
in the congregation of sinners a fire shall be kindled and in an
unbelieving nation wrath shall flame out
the ancient giants did not obtain pardon for their sins who were
destroyed trusting to their own strength
and he spared not the place where lot sojourned but abhorred them
for the pride of their word
he had not pity on them destroying the whole nation that
extolled themselves in their sins
so did he with the six hundred thousand footmen who were
gathered together in the hardness of their heart and if one had been
stiffnecked it is a wonder if he had escaped unpunished
he sentenced to die in the wilderness num
for mercy and wrath are with him he is mighty to forgive and to
pour out indignation
according as his mercy is so his correction judgeth a man
according to his works
the sinner shall not escape in his rapines and the patience of
him that sheweth mercy shall not be put off
all mercy shall make a place for every man according to the merit
of his works and according to the wisdom of his sojournment
say not i shall be hidden from god and who shall remember me
from on high
in such a multitude i shall not be known for what is my soul in
such an immense creation
behold the heaven and the heavens of heavens the deep and all
the earth and the things that are in them shall be moved in his sight
the mountains also and the hills and the foundations of the
earth when god shall look upon them they shall be shaken with
trembling
and in all these things the heart is senseless and every heart
is understood by him
and his ways who shall understand and the storm which no eye of
man shall see
for many of his works are hidden but the works of his justice
who shall declare or who shall endure for the testament is far from
some and the examination of all is in the end
he that wanteth understanding thinketh vain things and the
foolish and erring man thinketh foolish things
hearken to me my son and learn the discipline of understanding
and attend to my words in thy heart
and i will shew forth good doctrine in equity and will seek to
declare wisdom and attend to my words in thy heart whilst with equity
of spirit i tell thee the virtues that god hath put upon his works from
the beginning and i shew forth in truth his knowledge
the works of god are done in judgment from the beginning and
from the making of them he distinguished their parts and their
beginnings in their generations
he beautified their works for ever they have neither hungered
nor laboured and they have not ceased from their works
nor shall any of them straiten his neighbour at any time
be not thou incredulous to his word
after this god looked upon the earth and filled it with his
goods
the soul of every living thing hath shewn forth before the face
thereof and into it they return again
god created man of the earth and made him after his own image
and he turned him into it again and clothed him with strength
according to himself
he gave him the number of his days and time and gave him power
over all things that are upon the earth
he put the fear of him upon all flesh and he had dominion over
beasts and fowls
he created of him a helpmate like to himself he gave them
counsel and a tongue and eyes and ears and a heart to devise and he
filled them with the knowledge of understanding
he created in them the science of the spirit he fired their heart
with wisdom and shewed them both good and evil
he set his eye upon their hearts to shew them the greatness of his
works
that they might praise the name which he hath sanctified and
glory in his wondrous act that they might declare the glorious things of
his works
moreover he gave them instructions and the law of life for an
inheritance
he made an everlasting covenant with them and he shewed them his
justice and judgments
and their eye saw the majesty of his glory and their ears heard
his glorious voice and he said to them beware of all iniquity
and he gave to every one of them commandment concerning his
neighbour
their ways are always before him they are not hidden from his
eyes
over every nation he set a ruler
and israel was made the manifest portion of god
and all their works are as the sun in the sight of god and his
eyes are continually upon their ways
their covenants were not hid by their iniquity and all their
iniquities are in the sight of god
the alms of a man is as a signet with him and shall preserve the
grace of a man as the apple of the eye
and afterward he shall rise up and shall render them their
reward to every one upon their own head and shall turn them down into
the bowels of the earth
but to the penitent he hath given the way of justice and he hath
strengthened them that were fainting in patience and hath appointed to
them the lot of truth
turn to the lord and forsake thy sins
make thy prayer before the face of the lord and offend less
of sins
return to the lord and turn away from thy injustice and greatly
hate abomination
and know the justices and judgments of god and stand firm in the
lot set before thee and in prayer to the most high god
go to the side of the holy age with them that live and give
praise to god
the holy ones that follow god and godliness
tarry not in the error of the ungodly give glory before death
give thanks whilst thou art living whilst thou art alive and in
health thou shalt give thanks and shalt praise god and shalt glory in
his mercies
how great is the mercy of the lord and his forgiveness to them
that turn to him
for all things cannot be in men because the son of man is not
immortal and they are delighted with the vanity of evil
what is brighter than the sun yet it shall be eclipsed or what
is more wicked than that which flesh and blood hath invented and this
shall be reproved
he beholdeth the power of the height of heaven and all men are
earth and ashes
he that liveth for ever created all things together god only
shall be justified and he remaineth an invincible king for ever
who is able to declare his works
for who shall search out his glorious acts
and who shall show forth the power of his majesty or who shall be
able to declare his mercy
nothing may be taken away nor added neither is it possible to
find out the glorious works of god
when a man hath done then shall he begin and when he leaveth
off he shall be at a loss
man has done all that he can to find out his greatness and boundless
perfections he is still to begin for what he has found out is but a
mere nothing in comparison with his infinity
what is man and what is his grace and what is his good or what
is his evil
the number of the days of men at the most are a hundred years as
a drop of water of the sea are they esteemed and as a pebble of the
sand so are a few years compared to eternity
therefore god is patient in them and poureth forth his mercy upon
them
he hath seen the presumption of their heart that it is wicked
and hath known their end that it is evil
therefore hath he filled up his mercy in their favour and hath
shewn them the way of justice
the compassion of man is toward his neighbour but the mercy of
he hath mercy and teacheth and correcteth as a shepherd doth
his flock
he hath mercy on him that receiveth the discipline of mercy and
that maketh haste in his judgments
my son in thy good deeds make no complaint and when thou
givest any thing add not grief by an evil word
shall not the dew assuage the heat so also the good word is
better than the gift
lo is not a word better than a gift but both are with a
justified man
a fool will upbraid bitterly and a gift of one ill taught
consumeth the eyes
before judgment prepare thee justice and learn before thou
speak
before sickness take a medicine and before judgment examine
thyself and thou shalt find mercy in the sight of god
humble thyself before thou art sick and in the time of sickness
shew thy conversation
let nothing hinder thee from praying always and be not afraid to
be justified even to death for the reward of god continueth for ever
before prayer prepare thy soul and be not as a man that tempteth
remember the wrath that shall be at the last day and the time of
repaying when he shall turn away his face
remember poverty in the time of abundance and the necessities of
poverty in the day of riches
from the morning until the evening the time shall be changed and
all these are swift in the eyes of god
a wise man will fear in every thing and in the days of sins will
beware of sloth
every man of understanding knoweth wisdom and will give praise
to him that findeth her
they that were of good understanding in words have also done
wisely themselves and have understood truth and justice and have
poured forth proverbs and judgments
go not after thy lusts but turn away from thy own will
if thou give to thy soul her desires she will make thee a joy to
thy enemies
take no pleasure in riotous assemblies be they ever so small
for their concertation is continual
make not thyself poor by borrowing to contribute to feasts when
thou hast nothing in thy purse for thou shalt be an enemy to thy own
life
a workman that is a drunkard shall not be rich and he that
contemneth small things shall fall by little and little
wine and women make wise men fall off and shall rebuke the
prudent
and he that joineth himself to harlots will be wicked
greater example and his soul shall be taken away out of the number
he that is hasty to give credit is light of heart and shall be
lessened and he that sinneth against his own soul shall be despised
he that rejoiceth in iniquity shall be censured and he that
hateth chastisement shall have less life and he that hateth babbling
extinguisheth evil
he that sinneth against his own soul shall repent and he that is
delighted with wickedness shall be condemned
rehearse not again a wicked and harsh word and thou shalt not
fare the worse
tell not thy mind to friend or foe and if there be a sin with
thee disclose it not
for he will hearken to thee and will watch thee and as it were
defending thy sin he will hate thee and so will he be with thee always
hast thou heard a word against thy neighbour let it die within
thee trusting that it will not burst thee
at the hearing of a word the fool is in travail as a woman
groaning in the bringing forth a child
as an arrow that sticketh in a mans thigh so is a word in the
heart of a fool
reprove a friend lest he may not have understood and say i did
it not or if he did it that he may do it no more
reprove thy neighbour for it may be he hath not said it and if
he hath said it that he may not say it again
admonish thy friend for there is often a fault committed
and believe not every word there is one that slippeth with the
tongue but not from his heart
for who is there that hath not offended with his tongue
and give place to the fear of the most high for the fear of god
is all wisdom and therein is to fear god and the disposition of the
law is in all wisdom
but the learning of wickedness is not wisdom and the device of
sinners is not prudence
there is a subtle wickedness and the same is detestable and
there is a man that is foolish wanting in wisdom
better is a man that hath less wisdom and wanteth understanding
with the fear of god than he that aboundeth in understanding and
transgresseth the law of the most high
there is an exquisite subtilty and the same is unjust
and there is one that uttereth an exact word telling the truth
deceit
and there is one that submitteth himself exceedingly with a great
lowliness and there is one that casteth down his countenance and
maketh as if he did not see that which is unknown
and if he be hindered from sinning for want of power if he shall
find opportunity to do evil he will do it
a man is known by his look and a wise man when thou meetest
him is known by his countenance
the attire of the body and the laughter of the teeth and the
gait of the man shew what he is
there is a lying rebuke in the anger of an injurious man and
there is a judgment that is not allowed to be good and there is one
that holdeth his peace he is wise
how much better is it to reprove than to be angry and not to
hinder him that confesseth in prayer
the lust of an eunuch shall deflour a young maiden
so is he that by violence executeth of the unwise
how good is it when thou art reproved to shew repentance for
so thou shalt escape wilful sin
there is one that holdeth his peace that is found wise and there
is another that is hateful that is bold in speech
there is one that holdeth his peace because he knoweth not what
to say and there is another that holdeth his peace knowing the proper
time
a wise man will hold his peace till he see opportunity but a
babbler and a fool will regard no time
he that useth many words shall hurt his own soul and he that
taketh authority to himself unjustly shall be hated
there is success in evil things to a man without discipline and
there is a finding that turneth to loss
there is a gift that is not profitable and there is a gift the
recompense of which is double
there is an abasement because of glory and there is one that
shall lift up his head from a low estate
there is that buyeth much for a small price and restoreth the
same sevenfold
a man wise in words shall make himself beloved but the graces of
fools shall be poured out
the gift of the fool shall do thee no good for his eyes are
sevenfold
he will give a few things and upbraid much and the opening of
his mouth is the kindling of a fire
to day a man lendeth and to morrow he asketh it again such a
man as this is hateful
a fool shall have no friend and there shall be no thanks for his
good deeds
for they that eat his bread are of a false tongue how often
and how many will laugh him to scorn
for he doth not distribute with right understanding that which
was to be had in like manner also that which was not to be had
the slipping of a false tongue is as one that falleth on the
pavement so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily
a man without grace is as a vain fable it shall be continually
in the mouth of the unwise
a parable coming out of a fools mouth shall be rejected for he
doth not speak it in due season
there is that is hindered from sinning through want and in his
rest he shall be pricked
there is that will destroy his own soul through shamefacedness
and by occasion of an unwise person he will destroy it and by respect
of person he will destroy himself
there is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend and maketh
him his enemy for nothing
a lie is a foul blot in a man and yet it will be continually in
the mouth of men without discipline
a thief is better than a man that is always lying but both of
them shall inherit destruction
the manners of lying men are without honour and their confusion
is with them without ceasing
a wise man shall advance himself with his words and a prudent
man shall please the great ones
he that tilleth his land shall make a high heap of corn and he
that worketh justice shall be exalted and he that pleaseth great men
shall escape iniquity
presents and gifts blind the eyes of judges and make them dumb
in the mouth so that they cannot correct
o wisdom that is hid and treasure that is not seen what profit
is there in them both
better is he that hideth his folly than the man that hideth his
wisdom
my son hast thou sinned do so no more but for thy former sins
also pray that they may be forgiven thee
flee from sins as from the face of a serpent for if thou comest
near them they will take hold of thee
the teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion killing the souls of
men
all iniquity is like a twoedged sword there is no remedy for the
wound thereof
injuries and wrongs will waste riches and the house that is very
rich shall be brought to nothing by pride so the substance of the proud
shall be rooted out
the prayer out of the mouth of the poor shall reach the ears of
he that hateth to be reproved walketh in the trace of a sinner
and he that feareth god will turn to his own heart
he that is mighty by a bold tongue is known afar off but a wise
man knoweth to slip by him
he that buildeth his house at other mens charges is as he that
gathereth himself stones to build in the winter
the congregation of sinners is like tow heaped together and the
end of them is a flame of fire
the way of sinners is made plain with stones and in their end is
hell and darkness and pains
he that keepeth justice shall get the understanding thereof
the perfection of the fear of god is wisdom and understanding
he that is not wise in good will not be taught
but there is a wisdom that aboundeth in evil and there is no
understanding where there is bitterness
the knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood and his
counsel continueth like a fountain of life
the heart of a fool is like a broken vessel and no wisdom at all
shall it hold
a man of sense will praise every wise word he shall hear and
will apply it to himself the luxurious man hath heard it and it shall
displease him and he will cast it behind his back
the talking of a fool is like a burden in the way but in the
lips of the wise grace shall be found
the mouth of the prudent is sought after in the church and they
will think upon his words in their hearts
as a house that is destroyed so is wisdom to a fool and the
knowledge of the unwise is as words without sense
doctrine to a fool is as fetters on the feet and like manacles
on the right hand
a fool lifteth up his voice in laughter but a wise man will
scarce laugh low to himself
learning to the prudent is as an ornament of gold and like a
bracelet upon his right arm
the foot of a fool is soon in his neighbours house but a man of
experience will be abashed at the person of the mighty
a fool will peep through the window into the house but he that
is well taught will stand without
it is the folly of a man to hearken at the door and a wise man
will be grieved with the disgrace
the lips of the unwise will be telling foolish things but the
words of the wise shall be weighed in a balance
the heart of fools is in their mouth and the mouth of wise men
is in their heart
while the ungodly curseth the devil he curseth his own soul
by sin he takes part with the devil and is as it were his member and
subject
the talebearer shall defile his own soul and shall be hated by
all and he that shall abide with him shall be hateful the silent and
wise man shall be honoured
the sluggard is pelted with a dirty stone and all men will speak
of his disgrace
the sluggard is pelted with the dung of oxen and every one that
toucheth him will shake his hands
a son ill taught is the confusion of the father and a foolish
daughter shall be to his loss
a wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband but she
that confoundeth becometh a disgrace to her father
she that is bold shameth both her father and husband and will not
be inferior to the ungodly and shall be disgraced by them both
a tale out of time is like music in mourning but the stripes and
instruction of wisdom are never out of time
he that teacheth a fool is like one that glueth a potsherd
together
he that telleth a word to him that heareth not is like one that
waketh a man out of a deep sleep
he speaketh with one that is asleep who uttereth wisdom to a
fool and in the end of the discourse he saith who is this
weep for the dead for his light hath failed and weep for the
fool for his understanding faileth
that turns away from god to follow vanity and sin and what is said by
the wise man against fools is meant of such fools as these
weep but a little for the dead for he is at rest
for the wicked life of a wicked fool is worse than death
the mourning for the dead is seven days but for a fool and an
ungodly man all the days of their life
talk not much with a fool and go not with him that hath no sense
keep thyself from him that thou mayst not have trouble and thou
shalt not be defiled with his sin
turn away from him and thou shalt find rest and shalt not be
wearied out with his folly
what is heavier than lead and what other name hath he but fool
sand and salt and a mass of iron is easier to bear than a man
without sense that is both foolish and wicked
a frame of wood bound together in the foundation of a building
shall not be loosed so neither shall the heart that is established by
advised counsel
the thought of him that is wise at all times shall not be
depraved by fear
as pales set in high places and plasterings made without cost
will not stand against the face of the wind
so also a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool shall not
resist against the violence of fear
as a fearful heart in the thought of a fool at all times will not
fear so neither shall he that continueth always in the commandments of
he that pricketh the eye bringeth out tears and he that
pricketh the heart bringeth forth resentment
he that flingeth a stone at birds shall drive them away so he
that upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship
although thou hast drawn a sword at a friend despair not for
there may be a returning to a friend
if thou hast opened a sad mouth fear not for there may be a
reconciliation except upbraiding and reproach and pride and
disclosing of secrets or a treacherous wound for in all these cases a
friend will flee away
keep fidelity with a friend in his poverty that in his
prosperity also thou mayst rejoice
in the time of his trouble continue faithful to him that thou
mayst also be heir with him in his inheritance
as the vapour of a chimney and the smoke of the fire goeth up
before the fire so also injurious words and reproaches and threats
before blood
i will not be ashamed to salute a friend neither will i hide
myself from his face and if any evil happen to me by him i will bear
it
but every one that shall hear it will beware of him
who will set a guard before my mouth and a sure seal upon my
lips that i fall not by them and that my tongue destroy me not
other vices
o lord father and sovereign ruler of my life leave me not to
their counsel nor suffer me to fall by them
the foregoing chapter
who will set scourges over my thoughts and the discipline of
wisdom over my heart that they spare me not in their ignorances and
that their sins may not appear
scourges and discipline of wisdom may restrain the ignorances that is
the slips and offences which are usually committed by the tongue and the
lips
lest my ignorances increase and my offences be multiplied and my
sins abound and i fall before my adversaries and my enemy rejoice over
me
o lord father and god of my life leave me not to their devices
give me not haughtiness of my eyes and turn away from me all
coveting
take from me the greediness of the belly and let not the lusts of
the flesh take hold of me and give me not over to a shameless and
foolish mind
hear o ye children the discipline of the mouth and he that will
keep it shall not perish by his lips nor be brought to fall into most
wicked works
a sinner is caught in his own vanity and the proud and the evil
speakers shall fall thereby
let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing for in it there are
many falls
and let not the naming of god be usual in thy mouth and meddle
not with the names of saints for thou shalt not escape free from them
for as a slave daily put to the question is never without a blue
mark so every one that sweareth and nameth shall not be wholly pure
from sin
a man that sweareth much shall be filled with iniquity and a
scourge shall not depart from his house
and if he make it void his sin shall be upon him and if he
dissemble it he offendeth double
and if he swear in vain he shall not be justified for his house
shall be filled with his punishment
there is also another speech opposite to death let it not be
found in the inheritance of jacob
for from the merciful all these things shall be taken away and
they shall not wallow in sins
let not thy mouth be accustomed to indiscreet speech for therein
is the word of sin
remember thy father and thy mother for thou sittest in the midst
of great men
lest god forget thee in their sight and thou by thy daily
custom be infatuated and suffer reproach and wish that thou hadst not
been born and curse the day of thy nativity
the man that is accustomed to opprobrious words will never be
corrected all the days of his life
two sorts of men multiply sins and the third bringeth wrath and
destruction
a hot soul is a burning fire it will never be quenched till it
devour some thing
and a man that is wicked in the mouth of his flesh will not
leave off till he hath kindled a fire
to a man that is a fornicator all bread is sweet he will not be
weary of sinning unto the end
every man that passeth beyond his own bed despising his own
soul and saying who seeth me
darkness compasseth me about and the walls cover me and no man
seeth me whom do i fear the most high will not remember my sins
and he understandeth not that his eye seeth all things for such
a mans fear driveth him from the fear of god and the eyes of men
fearing him
and he knoweth not that the eyes of the lord are far brighter
than the sun beholding round about all the ways of men and the bottom
of the deep and looking into the hearts of men into the most hidden
parts
for all things were known to the lord god before they were
created so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things
this man shall be punished in the streets of the city and he
shall be chased as a colt and where he suspected not he shall be
taken
and he shall be in disgrace with all men because he understood
not the fear of the lord
so every woman also that leaveth her husband and bringeth in an
heir by another
for first she hath been unfaithful to the law of the most high
and secondly she hath offended against her husband thirdly she hath
fornicated in adultery and hath gotten her children of another man
this woman shall be brought into the assembly and inquisition
shall be made of her children
her children shall not take root and her branches shall bring
forth no fruit
she shall leave her memory to be cursed and her infamy shall not
be blotted out
and they that remain shall know that there is nothing better
than the fear of god and that there is nothing sweeter than to have
regard to the commandments of the lord
it is great glory to follow the lord for length of days shall be
received from him
fruits
wisdom shall praise her own self and shall be honoured in god
and shall glory in the midst of her people
and shall open her mouth in the churches of the most high and
shall glorify herself in the sight of his power
and in the midst of her own people she shall be exalted and shall
be admired in the holy assembly
and in the multitude of the elect she shall have praise and among
the blessed she shall be blessed saying
i came out of the mouth of the most high the firstborn before all
creatures
i made that in the heavens there should rise light that never
faileth and as a cloud i covered all the earth
i dwelt in the highest places and my throne is in a pillar of a
cloud
i alone have compassed the circuit of heaven and have penetrated
into the bottom of the deep and have walked in the waves of the sea
and have stood in all the earth and in every people
and in every nation i have had the chief rule
and by my power i have trodden under my feet the hearts of all
the high and low and in all these i sought rest and i shall abide in
the inheritance of the lord
then the creator of all things commanded and said to me and he
that made me rested in my tabernacle
and he said to me let thy dwelling be in jacob and thy
inheritance in israel and take root in my elect
from the beginning and before the world was i created and unto
the world to come i shall not cease to be and in the holy dwelling
place i have ministered before him
and so was i established in sion and in the holy city likewise i
rested and my power was in jerusalem
and i took root in an honourable people and in the portion of my
i was exalted like a cedar in libanus and as a cypress tree on
mount sion
i was exalted like a palm tree in cades and as a rose plant in
as a fair olive tree in the plains and as a planetree by the
water in the streets was i exalted
i gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aromatical balm i
yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh
and i perfumed my dwelling as storax and galbanum and onyx and
aloes and as the frankincense not cut and my odour is as the purest
balm
i have stretched out my branches as the turpentine tree and my
branches are of honour and grace
as the vine i have brought forth a pleasant odour and my flowers
are the fruit of honour and riches
i am the mother of fair love and of fear and of knowledge and
of holy hope
in me is all grace of the way and of the truth in me is all hope
of life and of virtue
come over to me all ye that desire me and be filled with my
fruits
for my spirit is sweet above honey and my inheritance above
honey and the honeycomb
my memory is unto everlasting generations
they that eat me shall yet hunger and they that drink me shall
yet thirst
he that hearkeneth to me shall not be confounded and they that
work by me shall not sin
they that explain me shall have life everlasting
all these things are the book of life and the covenant of the
most high and the knowledge of truth
moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices and an
inheritance to the house of jacob and the promises to israel
he appointed to david his servant to raise up of him a most
mighty king and sitting on the throne of glory for ever
overflowing river has enriched the earth with heavenly wisdom
who filleth up wisdom as the phison and as the tigris in the
days of the new fruits
who maketh understanding to abound as the euphrates who
multiplieth it as the jordan in the time of harvest
who sendeth knowledge as the light and riseth up as gehon in the
time of the vintage
who first hath perfect knowledge of her and a weaker shall not
search her out
perfect knowledge of heavenly wisdom
for her thoughts are more vast than the sea and her counsels
more deep than the great ocean
i wisdom have poured out rivers
i like a brook out of a river of a mighty water i like a
channel of a river and like an aqueduct came out of paradise
i said i will water my garden of plants and i will water
abundantly the fruits of my meadow
and behold my brook became a great river and my river came near
to a sea
for i make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning light
and i will declare it afar off
i will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth and will
behold all that sleep and will enlighten all that hope in the lord
i will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy and will leave it to
them that seek wisdom and will not cease to instruct their offspring
even to the holy age
see ye that i have not laboured myself only but for all that
seek out the truth
with three things my spirit is pleased which are approved before
the concord of brethren and the love of neighbours and man and
wife that agree well together
three sorts my soul hateth and i am greatly grieved at their
life
a poor man that is proud a rich man that is a liar an old man
that is a fool and doting
the things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth how shalt
thou find them in thy old age
o how comely is judgment for a grey head and for ancients to know
counsel
o how comely is wisdom for the aged and understanding and counsel
to men of honour
much experience is the crown of old men and the fear of god is
their glory
nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have i
magnified and the tenth i will utter to men with my tongue
a man that hath joy of his children and he that liveth and seeth
the fall of his enemies
blessed is he that dwelleth with a wise woman and that hath not
slipped with his tongue and that hath not served such as are unworthy
of him
blessed is he that findeth a true friend and that declareth
justice to an ear that heareth
how great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge but there is
none above him that feareth the lord
the fear of god hath set itself above all things
blessed is the man to whom it is given to have the fear of god
he that holdeth it to whom shall he be likened
the fear of god is the beginning of his love and the beginning
of faith is to be fast joined unto it
the sadness of the heart is every plague and the wickedness of a
woman is all evil
and a man will choose any plague but the plague of the heart
and any wickedness but the wickedness of a woman
and any affliction but the affliction from them that hate him
and any revenge but the revenge of enemies
there is no head worse than the head of a serpent
and there is no anger above the anger of a woman it will be more
agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon than to dwell with a wicked
woman
the wickedness of a woman changeth her face and she darkeneth
her countenance as a bear and sheweth it like sackcloth in the midst
of her neighbours
her husband groaned and hearing he sighed a little
all malice is short to the malice of a woman let the lot of
sinners fall upon her
as the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged so is
a wife full of tongue to a quiet man
look not upon a womans beauty and desire not a woman for
beauty
a womans anger and impudence and confusion is great
a woman if she have superiority is contrary to her husband
a wicked woman abateth the courage and maketh a heavy
countenance and a wounded heart
feeble hands and disjointed knees a woman that doth not make
her husband happy
from the woman came the beginning of sin and by her we all die
give no issue to thy water no not a little nor to a wicked
woman liberty to gad abroad
if she walk not at thy hand she will confound thee in the sight
of thy enemies
cut her off from thy flesh lest she always abuse thee
happy is the husband of a good wife for the number of his years
is double
a virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband and shall fulfil the years
of his life in peace
a good wife is a good portion she shall be given in the portion
of them that fear god to a man for his good deeds
rich or poor if his heart is good his countenance shall be
cheerful at all times
of three things my heart hath been afraid and at the fourth my
face hath trembled
the accusation of a city and the gathering together of the
people
and a false calumny all are more grievous than death
a jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the heart
with a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue which
communicateth with all
as a yoke of oxen that is moved to and fro so also is a wicked
woman he that hath hold of her is as he that taketh hold of a
scorpion
a drunken woman is a great wrath and her reproach and shame
shall not be hid
the fornication of a woman shall be known by the haughtiness of
her eyes and by her eyelids
on a daughter that turneth not away herself set a strict watch
lest finding an opportunity she abuse herself
take heed of the impudence of her eyes and wonder not if she
slight thee
she will open her mouth as a thirsty traveller to the fountain
and will drink of every water near her and will sit down by every
hedge and open her quiver against every arrow until she fail
the grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband and
shall fat his bones
her discipline is the gift of god
such is a wise and silent woman and there is nothing so much
worth as a well instructed soul
a holy and shamefaced woman is grace upon grace
and no price is worthy of a continent soul
as the sun when it riseth to the world in the high places of god
so is the beauty of a good wife for the ornament of her house
as the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick so is the beauty
of the face in a ripe age
as golden pillars upon bases of silver so are the firm feet upon
the soles of a steady woman
as everlasting foundations upon a solid rock so the commandments
of god in the heart of a holy woman
at two things my heart is grieved and the third bringeth anger
upon me
a man of war fainting through poverty and a man of sense
despised
and he that passeth over from justice to sin god hath prepared
such an one for the sword
two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and dangerous a
merchant is hardly free from negligence and a huckster shall not be
justified from the sins of the lips
because the eager pursuit of the mammon of this world is apt to make
men of that calling forget the great duties of loving god above all
things and their neighbours as themselvesibid a huckster or a
retailer of wine men of that profession are both greatly exposed to
danger of sin themselves and are too often accessary to the sins of
others
preservative he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it
through poverty many have sinned and he that seeketh to be
enriched turneth away his eye
as a stake sticketh fast in the midst of the joining of stones so
also in the midst of selling and buying sin shall stick fast
sin shall be destroyed with the sinner
unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the lord thy
house shall quickly be overthrown
as when one sifteth with a sieve the dust will remain so will
the perplexity of a man in his thoughts
the furnace trieth the potters vessels and the trial of
affliction just men
as the dressing of a tree sheweth the fruit thereof so a word out
of the thought of the heart of man
praise not a man before he speaketh for this is the trial of men
if thou followest justice thou shalt obtain her and shalt put
her on as a long robe of honour and thou shalt dwell with her and she
shall protect thee for ever and in the day of acknowledgment thou shalt
find a strong foundation
birds resort unto their like so truth will return to them that
practise her
the lion always lieth in wait for prey so do sins for them that
work iniquities
a holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun but a fool is changed
as the moon
in the midst of the unwise keep in the word till its time but be
continually among men that think
the discourse of sinners is hateful and their laughter is at the
pleasures of sin
the speech that sweareth much shall make the hair of the head
stand upright and its irreverence shall make one stop his ears
in the quarrels of the road is the shedding of blood and their
cursing is a grievous hearing
he that discloseth the secret of a friend loseth his credit and
shall never find a friend to his mind
love thy neighbour and be joined to him with fidelity
but if thou discover his secrets follow no more after him
for as a man that destroyeth his friend so is he that destroyeth
the friendship of his neighbour
and as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand so hast thou
let thy neighbour go and thou shalt not get him again
follow after him no more for he is gone afar off he is fled as
a roe escaped out of the snare because his soul is wounded
thou canst no more bind him up and of a curse there is
reconciliation
obtain a reconciliation after a curse than after disclosing a secret
but to disclose the secrets of a friend leaveth no hope to an
unhappy soul
he that winketh with the eye forgeth wicked things and no man
will cast him off
in the sight of thy eyes he will sweeten his mouth and will
admire thy words but at the last he will writhe his mouth and on thy
words he will lay a stumblingblock
i have hated many things but not like him and the lord will hate
him
if one cast a stone on high it will fall upon his own head and
the deceitful stroke will wound the deceitful
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and he that setteth a
stone for his neighbour shall stumble upon it and he that layeth a
snare for another shall perish in it
a mischievous counsel shall be rolled back upon the author and
he shall not know from whence it cometh to him
mockery and reproach are of the proud and vengeance as a lion
shall lie in wait for him
they shall perish in a snare that are delighted with the fall of
the just and sorrow shall consume them before they die
anger and fury are both of them abominable and the sinful man
shall be subject to them
he that seeketh to revenge himself shall find vengeance from the
forgive thy neighbour if he hath hurt thee and then shall thy
sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest
man to man reserveth anger and doth he seek remedy of god
he hath no mercy on a man like himself and doth he entreat for
his own sins
he that is but flesh nourisheth anger and doth he ask
forgiveness of god who shall obtain pardon for his sins
remember thy last things and let enmity cease
for corruption and death hang over in his commandments
remember the fear of god and be not angry with thy neighbour
remember the covenant of the most high and overlook the ignorance
of thy neighbour
refrain from strife and thou shalt diminish thy sins
for a passionate man kindleth strife and a sinful man will
trouble his friends and bring in debate in the midst of them that are
at peace
for as the wood of the forest is so the fire burneth and as a
mans strength is so shall his anger be and according to his riches he
shall increase his anger
a hasty contention kindleth a fire and a hasty quarrel sheddeth
blood and a tongue that beareth witness bringeth death
if thou blow the spark it shall burn as a fire and if thou spit
upon it it shall be quenched both come out of the mouth
the whisperer and the double tongue is accursed for he hath
troubled many that were at peace
the tongue of a third person hath disquieted many and scattered
them from nation to nation
it hath destroyed the strong cities of the rich and hath
overthrown the houses of great men
it hath cut in pieces the forces of people and undone strong
nations
the tongue of a third person hath cast out valiant women and
deprived them of their labours
he that hearkeneth to it shall never have rest neither shall he
have a friend in whom he may repose
the stroke of a whip maketh a blue mark but the stroke of the
tongue will break the bones
many have fallen by the edge of the sword but not so many as
have perished by their own tongue
blessed is he that is defended from a wicked tongue that hath
not passed into the wrath thereof and that hath not drawn the yoke
thereof and hath not been bound in its bands
for its yoke is a yoke of iron and its bands are bands of brass
the death thereof is a most evil death and hell is preferable to
it
its continuance shall not be for a long time but it shall
possess the ways of the unjust and the just shall not be burnt with its
flame
they that forsake god shall fall into it and it shall burn in
them and shall not be quenched and it shall be sent upon them as a
lion and as a leopard it shall tear them
hedge in thy ears with thorns hear not a wicked tongue and make
doors and bars to thy mouth
melt down thy gold and silver and make a balance for thy words
and a just bridle for thy mouth
and take heed lest thou slip with thy tongue and fall in the
sight of thy enemies who lie in wait for thee and thy fall be incurable
unto death
being surety
he that sheweth mercy lendeth to his neighbour and he that is
stronger in hand keepeth the commandments
bountiful in lending to his neighbour in his necessity
lend to thy neighbour in the time of his need and pay thou thy
neighbour again in due time
keep thy word and deal faithfully with him and thou shalt always
find that which is necessary for thee
many have looked upon a thing lent as a thing found and have
given trouble to them that helped them
till they receive they kiss the hands of the lender and in
promises they humble their voice
but when they should repay they will ask time and will return
tedious and murmuring words and will complain of the time
and if he be able to pay he will stand off he will scarce pay
one half and will count it as if he had found it
but if not he will defraud him of his money and he shall get him
for an enemy without cause
and he will pay him with reproaches and curses and instead of
honour and good turn will repay him injuries
many have refused to lend not out of wickedness but they were
afraid to be defrauded without cause
but yet towards the poor be thou more hearty and delay not to
shew him mercy
help the poor because of the commandment and send him not away
empty handed because of his poverty
lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend and hide it not
under a stone to be lost
place thy treasure in the commandments of the most high and it
shall bring thee more profit than gold
shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall obtain help
for thee against all evil
better than the shield of the mighty and better than the spear
it shall fight for thee against thy enemy
a good man is surety for his neighbour and he that hath lost
shame will leave him to himself
forget not the kindness of thy surety for he hath given his life
for thee
the sinner and the unclean fleeth from his surety
a sinner attributeth to himself the goods of his surety and he
that is of an unthankful mind will leave him that delivered him
a man is surety for his neighbour and when he hath lost all
shame he shall forsake him
evil suretyship hath undone many of good estate and hath tossed
them as a wave of the sea
it hath made powerful men to go from place to place round about
and they have wandered in strange countries
a sinner that transgresseth the commandment of the lord shall
fall into an evil suretyship and he that undertaketh many things shall
fall into judgment
recover thy neighbour according to thy power and take heed to
thyself that thou fall not
the chief thing for mans life is water and bread and clothing
and a house to cover shame
better is the poor mans fare under a roof of boards than
sumptuous cheer abroad in another mans house
be contented with little instead of much and thou shalt not hear
the reproach of going abroad
it is a miserable life to go as a guest from house to house for
where a man is a stranger he shall not deal confidently nor open his
mouth
he shall entertain and feed and give drink to the unthankful
and moreover he shall hear bitter words
go stranger and furnish the table and give others to eat what
thou hast in thy hand
give place to the honourable presence of my friends for i want
my house my brother being to be lodged with me
these things are grievous to a man of understanding the
upbraiding of houseroom and the reproaching of the lender
is hurtful
he that loveth his son frequently chastiseth him that he may
rejoice in his latter end and not grope after the doors of his
neighbours
he that instructeth his son shall be praised in him and shall
glory in him in the midst of them of his household
he that teacheth his son maketh his enemy jealous and in the
midst of his friends he shall glory in him
his father is dead and he is as if he were not dead for he hath
left one behind him that is like himself
while he lived he saw and rejoiced in him and when he died he was
not sorrowful neither was he confounded before his enemies
for he left behind him a defender of his house against his
enemies and one that will requite kindness to his friends
for the souls of his sons he shall bind up his wounds and at
every cry his bowels shall be troubled
a horse not broken becometh stubborn and a child left to himself
will become headstrong
give thy son his way and he shall make thee afraid play with
him and he shall make thee sorrowful
laugh not with him lest thou have sorrow and at the last thy
teeth be set on edge
give him not liberty in his youth and wink not at his devices
bow down his neck while he is young and beat his sides while he
is a child lest he grow stubborn and regard thee not and so be a
sorrow of heart to thee
instruct thy son and labour about him lest his lewd behaviour
be an offence to thee
better is a poor man who is sound and strong of constitution
than a rich man who is weak and afflicted with evils
health of the soul in holiness of justice is better than all
gold and silver and a sound body than immense revenues
there is no riches above the riches of the health of the body
and there is no pleasure above the joy of the heart
better is death than a bitter life and everlasting rest than
continual sickness
good things that are hidden in a mouth that is shut are as
messes of meat set about a grave
what good shall an offering do to an idol for it can neither
eat nor smell
so is he that is persecuted by the lord bearing the reward of
his iniquity
he seeth with his eyes and groaneth as an eunuch embracing a
virgin and sighing
give not up thy soul to sadness and afflict not thyself in thy
own counsel
the joyfulness of the heart is the life of a man and a never
failing treasure of holiness and the joy of a man is length of life
have pity on thy own soul pleasing god and contain thyself
gather up thy heart in his holiness and drive away sadness far from
thee
for sadness hath killed many and there is no profit in it
envy and anger shorten a mans days and pensiveness will bring
old age before the time
a cheerful and good heart is always feasting for his banquets
are prepared with diligence
watching for riches consumeth the flesh and the thought thereof
driveth away sleep
the thinking beforehand turneth away the understanding and a
grievous sickness maketh the soul sober
the rich man hath laboured in gathering riches together and when
he resteth he shall be filled with his goods
the poor man hath laboured in his low way of life and in the end
he is still poor
he that loveth gold shall not be justified and he that followeth
after corruption shall be filled with it
many have been brought to fall for gold and the beauty thereof
hath been their ruin
gold is a stumblingblock to them that sacrifice to it woe to them
that eagerly follow after it and every fool shall perish by it
blessed is the rich man that is found without blemish and that
hath not gone after gold nor put his trust in money nor in treasures
who is he and we will praise him for he hath done wonderful
things in his life
who hath been tried thereby and made perfect he shall have
glory everlasting he that could have transgressed and hath not
transgressed and could do evil things and hath not done them
therefore are his goods established in the lord and all the
church of the saints shall declare his alms
art thou set at a great table be not the first to open thy mouth
upon it
say not there are many things which are upon it
remember that a wicked eye is evil
what is created more wicked than an eye therefore shall it weep
over all the face when it shall see
stretch not out thy hand first lest being disgraced with envy
thou be put to confusion
be not hasty in a feast
judge of the disposition of thy neighbour by thyself
use as a frugal man the things that are set before thee lest if
thou eatest much thou be hated
leave off first for manners sake and exceed not lest thou
offend
and if thou sittest among many reach not thy hand out first of
all and be not the first to ask for drink
how sufficient is a little wine for a man well taught and in
sleeping thou shalt not be uneasy with it and thou shalt feel no pain
watching and choler and gripes are with an intemperate man
sound and wholesome sleep with a moderate man he shall sleep
till morning and his soul shall be delighted with him
and if thou hast been forced to eat much arise go out and
vomit and it shall refresh thee and thou shalt not bring sickness upon
thy body
hear me my son and despise me not and in the end thou shalt
find my words
in all thy works be quick and no infirmity shall come to thee
the lips of many shall bless him that is liberal of his bread
and the testimony of his truth is faithful
against him that is niggardly of his bread the city will murmur
and the testimony of his niggardliness is true
challenge not them that love wine for wine hath destroyed very
many
fire trieth hard iron so wine drunk to excess shall rebuke the
hearts of the proud
wine taken with sobriety is equal life to men if thou drink it
moderately thou shalt be sober
what is his life who is diminished with wine
what taketh away life death
wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful and not
to make them drunk
wine drunken with moderation is the joy of the soul and the
heart
sober drinking is health to soul and body
wine drunken with excess raiseth quarrels and wrath and many
ruins
wine drunken with excess is bitterness of the soul
the heat of drunkenness is the stumblingblock of the fool
lessening strength and causing wounds
rebuke not thy neighbour in a banquet of wine and despise him
not in his mirth
speak not to him words of reproach and press him not in
demanding again
doing nothing without counsel
have they made thee ruler be not lifted up be among them as one
of them
have care of them and so sit down and when thou hast acquitted
thyself of all thy charge take thy place
that thou mayst rejoice for them and receive a crown as an
ornament of grace and get the honour of the contribution
speak thou that art elder for it becometh thee
to speak the first word with careful knowledge and hinder not
music
where there is no hearing pour not out words and be not lifted
up out of season with thy wisdom
a concert of music in a banquet of wine is as a carbuncle set in
gold
as a signet of an emerald in a work of gold so is the melody of
music with pleasant and moderate wine
hear in silence and for thy reverence good grace shall come to
thee
young man scarcely speak in thy own cause
if thou be asked twice let thy answer be short
in many things be as if thou wert ignorant and hear in silence
and withal seeking
in the company of great men take not upon thee and when the
ancients are present speak not much
before a storm goeth lightning and before shamefacedness goeth
favour and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee
and at the time of rising be not slack but be first to run home
to thy house and there withdraw thyself and there take thy pastime
and do what thou hast a mind but not in sin or proud speech
and for all these things bless the lord that made thee and that
replenisheth thee with all his good things
he that feareth the lord will receive his discipline and they
that will seek him early shall find a blessing
he that seeketh the law shall be filled with it and he that
dealeth deceitfully shall meet with a stumblingblock therein
they that fear the lord shall find just judgment and shall
kindle justice as a light
a sinful man will flee reproof and will find an excuse according
to his will
a man of counsel will not neglect understanding a strange and
proud man will not dread fear
even after he hath done with fear without counsel he shall be
controlled by the things of his own seeking
my son do thou nothing without counsel and thou shalt not
repent when thou hast done
go not in the way of ruin and thou shalt not stumble against the
stones trust not thyself to a rugged way lest thou set a
stumblingblock to thy soul
and beware of thy own children and take heed of them of thy
household
in every work of thine regard thy soul in faith for this is the
keeping of the commandments
conscience
he that believeth god taketh heed to the commandments and he
that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse
servants
no evils shall happen to him that feareth the lord but in
temptation god will keep him and deliver him from evils
a wise man hateth not the commandments and justices and he shall
not be dashed in pieces as a ship in a storm
a man of understanding is faithful to the law of god and the law
is faithful to him
he that cleareth up a question shall prepare what to say and so
having prayed he shall be heard and shall keep discipline and then he
shall answer
the heart of a fool is as a wheel of a cart and his thoughts are
like a rolling axletree
a friend that is a mocker is like a stallion horse he neigheth
under every one that sitteth upon him
why doth one day excel another and one light another and one
year another year when all come of the sun
by the knowledge of the lord they were distinguished the sun
being made and keeping his commandment
and he ordered the seasons and holidays of them and in them they
celebrated festivals at an hour
some of them god made high and great days and some of them he
put in the number of ordinary days and all men are from the ground and
out of the earth from whence adam was created
with much knowledge the lord hath divided them and diversified
their ways
some of them hath he blessed and exalted and some of them hath
he sanctified and set near himself and some of them hath he cursed and
brought low and turned them from their station
as the potters clay is in his hand to fashion and order it
all his ways are according to his ordering so man is in the hand
of him that made him and he will render to him according to his
judgment
good is set against evil and life against death so also is the
sinner against a just man and so look upon all the works of the most
and i awaked last of all and as one that gathereth after the
grapegatherers
in the blessing of god i also have hoped and as one that
gathereth grapes have i filled the winepress
see that i have not laboured for myself only but for all that
seek discipline
hear me ye great men and all ye people and hearken with your
ears ye rulers of the church
give not to son or wife brother or friend power over thee while
thou livest and give not thy estate to another lest thou repent and
thou entreat for the same
as long as thou livest and hast breath in thee let no man
change thee
for it is better that thy children should ask of thee than that
thou look toward the hands of thy children
in all thy works keep the preeminence
with thy authority
let no stain sully thy glory in the time when thou shalt end the
days of thy life and in the time of thy decease distribute thy
inheritance
fodder and a wand and a burden are for an ass bread and
correction and work for a slave
he worketh under correction and seeketh to rest let his hands
be idle and he seeketh liberty
the yoke and the thong bend a stiff neck and continual labours
bow a slave
torture and fetters are for a malicious slave send him to work
that he be not idle
for idleness hath taught much evil
set him to work for so it is fit for him and if he be not
obedient bring him down with fetters but be not excessive towards any
one and do no grievous thing without judgment
if thou have a faithful servant let him be to thee as thy own
soul treat him as a brother because in the blood of thy soul thou hast
gotten him
if thou hurt him unjustly he will run away
and if he rise up and depart thou knowest not whom to ask and
in what way to seek him
the hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and
deceitful and dreams lift up fools
the man that giveth heed to lying visions is like to him that
catcheth at a shadow and followeth after the wind
the vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another
as when a mans likeness is before the face of a man
what can be made clean by the unclean and what truth can come
from that which is false
deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers
are vanity
and the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail except it be
a vision sent forth from the most high set not thy heart upon them
for dreams have deceived many and they have failed that put their
trust in them
the word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie and wisdom
shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful
what doth he know that hath not been tried a man that hath much
experience shall think of many things and he that hath learned many
things shall shew forth understanding
he that hath no experience knoweth little and he that hath been
experienced in many things multiplieth prudence
he that hath not been tried what manner of things doth he know
he that hath been surprised shall abound with subtlety
i have seen many things by travelling and many customs of
things
sometimes i have been in danger of death for these things and i
have been delivered by the grace of god
the spirit of those that fear god is sought after and by his
regard shall be blessed
for their hope is on him that saveth them and the eyes of god
are upon them that love him
he that feareth the lord shall tremble at nothing and shall not
be afraid for he is his hope
the soul of him that feareth the lord is blessed
to whom doth he look and who is his strength
the eyes of the lord are upon them that fear him he is their
powerful protector and strong stay a defence from the heat and a
cover from the sun at noon
a preservation from stumbling and a help from falling he
raiseth up the soul and enlighteneth the eyes and giveth health and
life and blessing
the offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully
gotten is stained and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable
the lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth
and justice
the most high approveth not the gifts of the wicked neither hath
he respect to the oblations of the unjust nor will he be pacified for
sins by the multitude of their sacrifices
he that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor is as one
that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father
the bread of the needy is the life of the poor he that
defraudeth them thereof is a man of blood
he that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat is like him that
killeth his neighbour
he that sheddeth blood and he that defraudeth the laborer of his
hire are brothers
when one buildeth up and another pulleth down what profit have
they but the labour
when one prayeth and another curseth whose voice will god hear
he that washeth himself after touching the dead if he toucheth
him again what doth his washing avail
so a man that fasteth for his sins and doth the same again what
doth his humbling himself profit him who will hear his prayer
he that keepeth the law multiplieth offerings
it is a wholesome sacrifice to take heed to the commandments and
to depart from all iniquity
and to depart from injustice is to offer a propitiatory sacrifice
for injustices and a begging of pardon for sins
he shall return thanks that offereth fine flour and he that doth
mercy offereth sacrifice
to depart from iniquity is that which pleaseth the lord and to
depart from injustice is an entreaty for sins
thou shalt not appear empty in the sight of the lord
for all these things are to be done because of the commandment of
the oblation of the just maketh the altar fat and is an odour of
sweetness in the sight of the most high
the sacrifice of the just is acceptable and the lord will not
forget the memorial thereof
give glory to god with a good heart and diminish not the
firstfruits of thy hands
in every gift shew a cheerful countenance and sanctify thy
tithes with joy
give to the most high according to what he hath given to thee
and with a good eye do according to the ability of thy hands
for the lord maketh recompense and will give thee seven times as
much
do not offer wicked gifts for such he will not receive
and look not upon an unjust sacrifice for the lord is judge and
there is not with him respect of person
the lord will not accept any person against a poor man and he
will hear the prayer of him that is wronged
he will not despise the prayers of the fatherless nor the widow
when she poureth out her complaint
do not the widows tears run down the cheek and her cry against
him that causeth them to fall
for from the cheek they go up even to heaven and the lord that
heareth will not be delighted with them
he that adoreth god with joy shall be accepted and his prayer
shall approach even to the clouds
the prayer of him that humbleth himself shall pierce the clouds
and till it come nigh he will not be comforted and he will not depart
till the most high behold
and the lord will not be slack but will judge for the just and
will do judgment and the almighty will not have patience with them
that he may crush their back
and he will repay vengeance to the gentiles till he have taken
away the multitude of the proud and broken the sceptres of the unjust
till he have rendered to men according to their deeds and
according to the works of adam and according to his presumption
till he have judged the cause of his people and he shall delight
the just with his mercy
the mercy of god is beautiful in the time of affliction as a
cloud of rain in the time of drought
have mercy upon us o god of all and behold us and shew us the
light of thy mercies
and send thy fear upon the nations that have not sought after
thee that they may know that there is no god beside thee and that they
may shew forth thy wonders
lift up thy hand over the strange nations that they may see thy
power
for as thou hast been sanctified in us in their sight so thou
shalt be magnified among them in our presence
that they may know thee as we also have known thee that there is
no god beside thee o lord
renew thy signs and work new miracles
glorify thy hand and thy right arm
raise up indignation and pour out wrath
take away the adversary and crush the enemy
hasten the time and remember the end that they may declare thy
wonderful works
let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire and
let them perish that oppress thy people
crush the head of the princes of the enemies that say there is
no other beside us
gather together all the tribes of jacob that they may know that
there no god besides thee and may declare thy great works and thou
shalt inherit them as from the beginning
have mercy on thy people upon whom thy name is invoked and upon
have mercy on jerusalem the city which thou hast sanctified the
city of thy rest
fill sion with thy unspeakable words and thy people with thy
glory
give testimony to them that are thy creatures from the beginning
and raise up the prophecies which the former prophets spoke in thy name
reward them that patiently wait for thee that thy prophets may
be found faithful and hear the prayers of thy servants
according to the blessing of aaron over thy people and direct us
into the way of justice and let all know that dwell upon the earth
that thou art god the beholder of all ages
the belly will devour all meat yet one is better than another
the palate tasteth venison and the wise heart false speeches
a perverse heart will cause grief and a man of experience will
resist it
a woman will receive every man yet one daughter is better than
another
propose to her to marry though she does not like him but marries in
obedience to her parents who make the choice for her
the beauty of a woman cheereth the countenance of her husband
and a man desireth nothing more
if she have a tongue that can cure and likewise mitigate and
shew mercy her husband is not like other men
he that possesseth a good wife beginneth a possession she is a
help like to himself and a pillar of rest
where there is no hedge the possession shall be spoiled and
where there is no wife he mourneth that is in want
who will trust him that hath no rest and that lodgeth
wheresoever the night taketh him as a robber well appointed that
skippeth from city to city
every friend will say i also am his friend but there is a
friend that is only a friend in name is not this a grief even to
death
but a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy
o wicked presumption whence camest thou to cover the earth with
thy malice and deceitfulness
there is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys
but in the time of trouble he will be against him
there is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his bellys
sake and he will take up a shield against the enemy
forget not thy friend in thy mind and be not unmindful of him in
thy riches
consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee and hide thy
counsel from them that envy thee
every counsellor giveth out counsel but there is one that is a
counsellor for himself
beware of a counsellor and know before what need he hath for he
will devise to his own mind
lest he thrust a stake into the ground and say to thee
thy way is good and then stand on the other side to see what
shall befall thee
treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness nor
with an unjust man concerning justice nor with a woman touching her of
whom she is jealous nor with a coward concerning war nor with a
merchant about traffic nor with a buyer of selling nor with an envious
man of giving thanks
nor with the ungodly of piety nor with the dishonest of honesty
nor with the field laborer of every work
nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the
year nor with an idle servant of much business give no heed to these
in any matter of counsel
but be continually with a holy man whomsoever thou shalt know to
observe the fear of god
whose soul is according to thy own soul and who when thou shalt
stumble in the dark will be sorry for thee
and establish within thyself a heart of good counsel for there
is no other thing of more worth to thee than it
the soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things more
than seven watchmen that sit in a high place to watch
but above all these things pray to the most high that he may
direct thy way in truth
in all thy works let the true word go before thee and steady
counsel before every action
a wicked word shall change the heart out of which four manner of
things arise good and evil life and death and the tongue is
continually the ruler of them there is a man that is subtle and a
teacher of many and yet is unprofitable to his own soul
a skilful man hath taught many and is sweet to his own soul
he that speaketh sophistically is hateful he shall be destitute
of every thing
grace is not given him from the lord for he is deprived of all
wisdom
there is a wise man that is wise to his own soul and the fruit
of his understanding is commendable
a wise man instructeth his own people and the fruits of his
understanding are faithful
a wise man shall be filled with blessings and they that see
shall praise him
the life of a man is in the number of his days but the days of
a wise man shall inherit honour among his people and his name
shall live for ever
my son prove thy soul in thy life and if it be wicked give it
no power
for all things are not expedient for all and every kind pleaseth
not every soul
be not greedy in any feasting and pour not out thyself upon any
meat
for in many meats there will be sickness and greediness will
turn to choler
by surfeiting many have perished but he that is temperate shall
prolong life
are to mourn for the dead of the employments of labourers and
artificers
honour the physician for the need thou hast of him for the most
for all healing is from god and he shall receive gifts of the
king
the skill of the physician shall lift up his head and in the
sight of great men he shall be praised
the most high hath created medicines out of the earth and a wise
man will not abhor them
was not bitter water made sweet with wood
the virtue of these things is come to the knowledge of men and
the most high hath given knowledge to men that he may be honoured in
his wonders
by these he shall cure and shall allay their pains and of these
the apothecary shall make sweet confections and shall make up ointments
of health and of his works there shall be no end
for the peace of god is over all the face of the earth
my son in thy sickness neglect not thyself but pray to the lord
and he shall heal thee
turn away from sin and order thy hands aright and cleanse thy
heart from all offence
give a sweet savour and a memorial of fine flour and make a fat
offering and then give place to the physician
for the lord created him and let him not depart from thee for
his works are necessary
for there is a time when thou must fall into their hands
and they shall beseech the lord that he would prosper what they
give for ease and remedy for their conversation
he that sinneth in the sight of his maker shall fall into the
hands of the physician
my son shed tears over the dead and begin to lament as if thou
hadst suffered some great harm and according to judgment cover his
body and neglect not his burial
and for fear of being ill spoken of weep bitterly for a day and
then comfort thyself in thy sadness
and make mourning for him according to his merit for a day or
two for fear of detraction
for of sadness cometh death and it overwhelmeth the strength
and the sorrow of the heart boweth down the neck
in withdrawing aside sorrow remaineth and the substance of the
poor is according to his heart
give not up thy heart to sadness but drive it from thee and
remember the latter end
forget it not for there is no returning and thou shalt do him
no good and shalt hurt thyself
remember my judgment for thine also shall be so yesterday for
me and to day for thee
when the dead is at rest let his remembrance rest and comfort
him in the departing of his spirit
the wisdom of a scribe cometh by his time of leisure and he that
is less in action shall receive wisdom
with what wisdom shall he be furnished that holdeth the plough
and that glorieth in the goad that driveth the oxen therewith and is
occupied in their labours and his whole talk is about the offspring of
bulls
he shall give his mind to turn up furrows and his care is to
give the kine fodder
so every craftsman and workmaster that laboureth night and day
he who maketh graven seals and by his continual diligence varieth the
figure he shall give his mind to the resemblance of the picture and by
his watching shall finish the work
so doth the smith sitting by the anvil and considering the iron
work the vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh and he fighteth with the
heat of the furnace
the noise of the hammer is always in his ears and his eye is
upon the pattern of the vessel he maketh
he setteth his mind to finish his work and his watching to
polish them to perfection
so doth the potter sitting at his work turning the wheel about
with his feet who is always carefully set to his work and maketh all
his work by number
he fashioneth the clay with his arm and boweth down his strength
before his feet
he shall give his mind to finish the glazing and his watching to
make clean the furnace
all these trust to their hands and every one is wise in his own
art
without these a city is not built
and they shall not dwell nor walk about therein and they shall
not go up into the assembly
upon the judges seat they shall not sit and the ordinance of
judgment they shall not understand neither shall they declare
discipline and judgment and they shall not be found where parables are
spoken
but they shall strengthen the state of the world and their
prayer shall be in the work of their craft applying their soul and
searching in the law of the most high
works
the wise man will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients and
will be occupied in the prophets
he will keep the sayings of renowned men and will enter withal
into the subtilties of parables
he will search out the hidden meanings of proverbs and will be
conversant in the secrets of parables
he shall serve among great men and appear before the governor
he shall pass into strange countries for he shall try good and
evil among men
he will give his heart to resort early to the lord that made him
and he will pray in the sight of the most high
he will open his mouth in prayer and will make supplication for
his sins
for if it shall please the great lord he will fill him with the
spirit of understanding
and he will pour forth the words of his wisdom as showers and in
his prayer he will confess to the lord
and he shall direct his counsel and his knowledge and in his
secrets shall he meditate
he shall shew forth the discipline he hath learned and shall
glory in the law of the covenant of the lord
many shall praise his wisdom and it shall never be forgotten
the memory of him shall not depart away and his name shall be in
request from generation to generation
nations shall declare his wisdom and the church shall shew forth
his praise
if he continue he shall leave a name above a thousand and if he
rest it shall be to his advantage
i will yet meditate that i may declare for i am filled as with a
holy transport
by a voice he saith hear me ye divine offspring and bud forth
as the rose planted by the brooks of waters
of god whom he exhorts to bud forth and flourish with virtue
give ye a sweet odour as frankincense
send forth flowers as the lily and yield a smell and bring
forth leaves in grace and praise with canticles and bless the lord in
his works
magnify his name and give glory to him with the voice of your
lips and with the canticles of your mouths and with harps and in
praising him you shall say in this manner
all the works of the lord are exceeding good
at his word the waters stood as a heap and at the words of his
mouth the receptacles of waters
for at his commandment favour is shewn and there is no
diminishing of his salvation
the works of all flesh are before him and there is nothing hid
from his eyes
he seeth from eternity to eternity and there is nothing
wonderful before him
there is no saying what is this or what is that for all things
shall be sought in their time
his blessing hath overflowed like a river
and as a flood hath watered the earth so shall his wrath inherit
the nations that have not sought after him
even as he turned the waters into a dry land and the earth was
made dry and his ways were made plain for their journey so to sinners
they are stumblingblocks in his wrath
good things were created for the good from the beginning so for
the wicked good and evil things
the principal things necessary for the life of men are water
fire and iron salt milk and bread of flour and honey and the
cluster of the grape and oil and clothing
all these things shall be for good to the holy so to the sinners
and the ungodly they shall be turned into evil
there are spirits that are created for vengeance and in their
fury they lay on grievous torments
in the time of destruction they shall pour out their force and
they shall appease the wrath of him that made them
fire hail famine and death all these were created for
vengeance
the teeth of beasts and scorpions and serpents and the sword
taking vengeance upon the ungodly unto destruction
in his commandments they shall feast and they shall be ready
upon earth when need is and when their time is come they shall not
transgress his word
therefore from the beginning i was resolved and i have
meditated and thought on these things and left them in writing
all the works of the lord are good and he will furnish every
work in due time
it is not to be said this is worse than that for all shall be
well approved in their time
now therefore with the whole heart and mouth praise ye him and
bless the name of the lord
fear
great labour is created for all men and a heavy yoke is upon the
children of adam from the day of their coming out of their mothers
womb until the day of their burial into the mother of all
their thoughts and fears of the heart their imagination of
things to come and the day of their end
from him that sitteth on a glorious throne unto him that is
humbled in earth and ashes
from him that weareth purple and beareth the crown even to him
that is covered with rough linen wrath envy trouble unquietness and
the fear of death continual anger and strife
and in the time of rest upon his bed the sleep of the night
changeth his knowledge
a little and as nothing is his rest and afterward in sleep as in
the day of keeping watch
he is troubled in the vision of his heart as if he had escaped in
the day of battle in the time of his safety he rose up and wondereth
that there is no fear
such things happen to all flesh from man even to beast and upon
sinners are sevenfold more
moreover death and bloodshed strife and sword oppressions
famine and affliction and scourges
all these things are created for the wicked and for their sakes
came the flood
all things that are of the earth shall return to the earth
again and all waters shall return to the sea
all bribery and injustice shall be blotted out and fidelity
shall stand for ever
the riches of the unjust shall be dried up like a river and
shall pass away with a noise like a great thunder in rain
while he openeth his hands he shall rejoice but transgressors
shall pine away in the end
the offspring of the ungodly shall not bring forth many branches
and make a noise as unclean roots upon the top of a rock
the weed growing over every water and at the bank of the river
shall be pulled up before all grass
grace is like a paradise in blessings and mercy remaineth for
ever
the life of a laborer that is content with what he hath shall be
sweet and in it thou shalt find a treasure
children and the building of a city shall establish a name but
a blameless wife shall be counted above them both
wine and music rejoice the heart but the love of wisdom is above
them both
the flute and the psaltery make a sweet melody but a pleasant
tongue is above them both
thy eye desireth favour and beauty but more than these green
sown fields
a friend and companion meeting together in season but above them
both is a wife with her husband
brethren are a help in the time of trouble but mercy shall
deliver more than they
gold and silver make the feet stand sure but wise counsel is
above them both
riches and strength lift up the heart but above these is the
fear of the lord
there is no want in the fear of the lord and it needeth not to
seek for help
the fear of the lord is like a paradise of blessing and they
have covered it above all glory
my son in thy lifetime be not indigent for it is better to die
than to want
the life of him that looketh toward another mans table is not to
be counted a life for he feedeth his soul with another mans meat
but a man well instructed and taught will look to himself
begging will be sweet in the mouth of the unwise but in his
belly there shall burn a fire
things we ought to be ashamed
o death how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath
peace in his possessions
to a man that is at rest and whose ways are prosperous in all
things and that is yet able to take meat
o death thy sentence is welcome to the man that is in need and to
him whose strength faileth
who is in a decrepit age and that is in care about all things
and to the distrustful that loseth patience
fear not the sentence of death remember what things have been
before thee and what shall come after thee this sentence is from the
and what shall come upon thee by the good pleasure of the most
for among the dead there is no accusing of life
the children of sinners become children of abominations and they
that converse near the houses of the ungodly
the inheritance of the children of sinners shall perish and with
their posterity shall be a perpetual reproach
the children will complain of an ungodly father because for his
sake they are in reproach
woe to you ungodly men who have forsaken the law of the most
high lord
and if you be born you shall be born in malediction and if you
die in malediction shall be your portion
all things that are of the earth shall return into the earth so
the ungodly shall from malediction to destruction
the mourning of men is about their body but the name of the
ungodly shall be blotted out
take care of a good name for this shall continue with thee more
than a thousand treasures precious and great
a good life hath its number of days but a good name shall
continue for ever
my children keep discipline in peace for wisdom that is hid
and a treasure that is not seen what profit is there in them both
better is the man that hideth his folly than the man that hideth
his wisdom
wherefore have a shame of these things i am now going to speak
of
things which i am now going to mention for though sometimes
shamefacedness is not to be indulged yet it is often good and
necessary as in the following cases
for it is not good to keep all shamefacedness and all things do
not please all men in opinion
be ashamed of fornication before father and mother and of a lie
before a governor and a man in power
of an offence before a prince and a judge of iniquity before a
congregation and a people
of injustice before a companion and friend and in regard to the
place where thou dwellest
of theft and of the truth of god and the covenant of leaning
with thy elbow over meat and of deceit in giving and taking
of silence before them that salute thee of looking upon a
harlot and of turning away thy face from thy kinsman
turn not away thy face from thy neighbour and of taking away a
portion and not restoring
gaze not upon another mans wife and be not inquisitive after
his handmaid and approach not her bed
be ashamed of upbraiding speeches before friends and after thou
hast given upbraid not
women the works and greatness of god
repeat not the word which thou hast heard and disclose not the
thing that is secret so shalt thou be truly without confusion and
shalt find favour before all men be not ashamed of any of these things
and accept no person to sin thereby
of the law of the most high and of his covenant and of judgment
to justify the ungodly
of the affair of companions and travellers and of the gift of the
inheritance of friends
of exactness of balance and weights of getting much or little
of the corruption of buying and of merchants and of much
correction of children and to make the side of a wicked slave to bleed
sure keeping is good over a wicked wife
where there are many hands shut up and deliver all things in
number and weight and put all in writing that thou givest out or
receivest in
be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish and the aged
that are judged by young men and thou shalt be well instructed in all
things and well approved in the sight of all men living
the father waketh for the daughter when no man knoweth and the
care for her taketh away his sleep when she is young lest she pass
away the flower of her age and when she is married lest she should be
hateful
in her virginity lest she should be corrupted and be found with
child in her fathers house and having a husband lest she should
misbehave herself or at the least become barren
keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter lest at anytime she
make thee become a laughingstock to thy enemies and a byword in the
city and a reproach among the people and she make thee ashamed before
all the multitude
behold not everybodys beauty and tarry not among women
for from garments cometh a moth and from a woman the iniquity of
a man
for better is the iniquity of a man than a woman doing a good
turn and a woman bringing shame and reproach
less danger to be apprehended to the soul from the churlishness or
injuries we receive from men than from the flattering favours and
familiarity of women
i will now remember the works of the lord and i will declare the
things i have seen by the words of the lord are his works
the sun giving light hath looked upon all things and full of the
glory of the lord is his work
hath not the lord made the saints to declare all his wonderful
works which the lord almighty hath firmly settled to be established for
his glory
he hath searched out the deep and the heart of men and
considered their crafty devices
for the lord knoweth all knowledge and hath beheld the signs of
the world he declareth the things that are past and the things that
are to come and revealeth the traces of hidden things
no thought escapeth him and no word can hide itself from him
he hath beautified the glorious works of his wisdom and he is
from eternity to eternity and to him nothing may be added
nor can he be diminished and he hath no need of any counsellor
o how desirable are all his works and what we can know is but as
a spark
all these things live and remain for ever and for every use all
things obey him
all things are double one against another and he hath made
nothing defective
he hath established the good things of every one and who shall
be filled with beholding his glory
sufficiently to praise him
the firmament on high is his beauty the beauty of heaven with its
glorious shew
the sun when he appeareth shewing forth at his rising an
admirable instrument the work of the most high
at noon he burneth the earth and who can abide his burning heat
the sun three times as much burneth the mountains breathing out
fiery vapours and shining with his beams he blindeth the eyes
great is the lord that made him and at his words he hath hastened
his course
and the moon in all in her season is for a declaration of times
and a sign of the world
from the moon is the sign of the festival day a light that
decreaseth in her perfection
the month is called after her name increasing wonderfully in her
perfection
being an instrument of the armies on high shining gloriously in
the firmament of heaven
the glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven the lord
enlighteneth the world on high
by the words of the holy one they stand in judgment and shall
never fall in their watches
look upon the rainbow and bless him that made it it is very
beautiful in its brightness
it encompasseth the heaven about with the circle of its glory
the hands of the most high have displayed it
by his commandment he maketh the snow to fall apace and sendeth
forth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment
through this are the treasures opened and the clouds fly out
like birds
by his greatness he hath fixed the clouds and the hailstones are
broken
at his sight shall the mountains be shaken and at his will the
south wind shall blow
the noise of his thunder shall strike the earth so doth the
northern storm and the whirlwind
and as the birds lighting upon the earth he scattereth snow and
the falling thereof is as the coming down of locusts
the eye admireth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof and the
heart is astonished at the shower thereof
he shall pour frost as salt upon the earth and when it freezeth
it shall become like the tops of thistles
the cold north wind bloweth and the water is congealed into
crystal upon every gathering together of waters it shall rest and
shall clothe the waters as a breastplate
and it shall devour the mountains and burn the wilderness and
consume all that is green as with fire
a present remedy of all is the speedy coming of a cloud and a
dew that meeteth it by the heat that cometh shall overpower it
at his word the wind is still and with his thought he appeaseth
the deep and the lord hath planted islands therein
let them that sail on the sea tell the dangers thereof and when
we hear with our ears we shall admire
there are great and wonderful works a variety of beasts and of
all living things and the monstrous creatures of whales
through him is established the end of their journey and by his
word all things are regulated
we shall say much and yet shall want words but the sum of our
words is he is all
what shall we be able to do to glorify him for the almighty
himself is above all his works
the lord is terrible and exceeding great and his power is
admirable
glorify the lord as much as ever you can for he will yet far
exceed and his magnificence is wonderful
blessing the lord exalt him as much as you can for he is above
all praise
when you exalt him put forth all your strength and be not weary
for you can never go far enough
who shall see him and declare him and who shall magnify him as
he is from the beginning
there are many things hidden from us that are greater than these
for we have seen but a few of his works
but the lord hath made all things and to the godly he hath given
wisdom
let us now praise men of renown and our fathers in their
generation
the lord hath wrought great glory through his magnificence from
the beginning
such as have borne rule in their dominions men of great power
and endued with their wisdom shewing forth in the prophets the dignity
of prophets
and ruling over the present people and by the strength of wisdom
instructing the people in most holy words
such as by their skill sought out musical tunes and published
canticles of the scriptures
rich men in virtue studying beautifulness living at peace in
their houses
all these have gained glory in their generations and were praised
in their days
they that were born of them have left a name behind them that
their praises might be related
and there are some of whom there is no memorial who are
perished as if they had never been and are become as if they had never
been born and their children with them
but these were men of mercy whose godly deeds have not failed
good things continue with their seed
their posterity are a holy inheritance and their seed hath stood
in the covenants
and their children for their sakes remain for ever their seed
and their glory shall not be forsaken
their bodies are buried in peace and their name liveth unto
generation and generation
let the people shew forth their wisdom and the church declare
their praise
henoch pleased god and was translated into paradise that he may
give repentance to the nations
noe was found perfect just and in the time of wrath he was made
a reconciliation
therefore was there a remnant left to the earth when the flood
came
the covenants of the world were made with him that all flesh
should no more be destroyed with the flood
abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations and there
was not found the like to him in glory who kept the law of the most
in his flesh he established the covenant and in temptation he
was found faithful
therefore by an oath he gave him glory in his posterity that he
should increase as the dust of the earth
and that he would exalt his seed as the stars and they should
inherit from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth
and he did in like manner with isaac for the sake of abraham his
father
the lord gave him the blessing of all nations and confirmed his
covenant upon the head of jacob
he acknowledged him in his blessings and gave him an
inheritance and divided him his portion in twelve tribes
and he preserved for him men of mercy that found grace in the
eyes of all flesh
moses was beloved of god and men whose memory is in benediction
he made him like the saints in glory and magnified him in the
fear of his enemies and with his words he made prodigies to cease
he glorified him in the sight of kings and gave him commandments
in the sight of his people and shewed him his glory
he sanctified him in his faith and meekness and chose him out of
all flesh
for he heard him and his voice and brought him into a cloud
and he gave him commandments before his face and a law of life
and instruction that he might teach jacob his covenant and israel his
judgments
he exalted aaron his brother and like to himself of the tribe of
he made an everlasting covenant with him and gave him the
priesthood of the nation and made him blessed in glory
and he girded him about with a glorious girdle and clothed him
with a robe of glory and crowned him with majestic attire
he put upon him a garment to the feet and breeches and an
ephod and he compassed him with many little bells of gold all round
about
that as he went there might be a sound and a noise made that
might be heard in the temple for a memorial to the children of his
people
he gave him a holy robe of gold and blue and purple a woven
work of a wise man endued with judgment and truth
of twisted scarlet the work of an artist with precious stones
cut and set in gold and graven by the work of a lapidary for a
memorial according to the number of the tribes of israel
and a crown of gold upon his mitre wherein was engraved holiness
an ornament of honour a work of power and delightful to the eyes for
its beauty
before him there were none so beautiful even from the beginning
no stranger was ever clothed with them but only his children
alone and his grandchildren for ever
his sacrifices were consumed with fire every day
moses filled his hands and anointed him with holy oil
this was made to him for an everlasting testament and to his
seed as the days of heaven to execute the office of the priesthood and
to have praise and to glorify his people in his name
he chose him out of all men living to offer sacrifice to god
incense and a good savour for a memorial to make reconciliation for
his people
and he gave him power in his commandments in the covenants of
his judgments that he should teach jacob his testimonies and give
light to israel in his law
and strangers stood up against him and through envy the men that
were with dathan and abiron compassed him about in the wilderness and
the congregation of core in their wrath
the lord god saw and it pleased him not and they were consumed
in his wrathful indignation
he wrought wonders upon them and consumed them with a flame of
fire
and he added glory to aaron and gave him an inheritance and
divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase of the earth
he prepared them bread in the first place unto fulness for the
sacrifices also of the lord they shall eat which he gave to him and to
his seed
but he shall not inherit among the people in the land and he
hath no portion among the people for he himself is his portion and
inheritance
phinees the son of eleazar is the third in glory by imitating
him in the fear of the lord
and he stood up in the shameful fall of the people in the
goodness and readiness of his soul he appeased god for israel
therefore he made to him a covenant of peace to be the prince of
the sanctuary and of his people that the dignity of priesthood should
be to him and to his seed for ever
and a covenant to david the king the son of jesse of the tribe
of juda an inheritance to him and to his seed that he might give
wisdom into our heart to judge his people in justice that their good
things might not be abolished and he made their glory in their nation
everlasting
valiant in war was jesus the son of nave who was successor of
very great for the saving the elect of god to overthrow the
enemies that rose up against them that he might get the inheritance for
how great glory did he gain when he lifted up his hands and
stretched out swords against the cities
who before him hath so resisted for the lord himself brought the
enemies
was not the sun stopped in his anger and one day made as two
he called upon the most high sovereign when the enemies assaulted
him on every side and the great and holy god heard him by hailstones of
exceeding great force
he made a violent assault against the nation of his enemies and
in the descent he destroyed the adversaries
that the nations might know his power that it is not easy to
fight against god and he followed the mighty one
and in the days of moses he did a work of mercy he and caleb the
son of jephone in standing against the enemy and withholding the
people from sins and appeasing the wicked murmuring
and they two being appointed were delivered out of the danger
from among the number of six hundred thousand men on foot to bring them
into their inheritance into the land that floweth with milk and honey
and the lord gave strength also to caleb and his strength
continued even to his old age so that he went up to the high places of
the land and his seed obtained it for an inheritance
that all the children of israel might see that it is good to
obey the holy god
then all the judges every one by name whose heart was not
corrupted who turned not away from the lord
that their memory might be blessed and their bones spring up out
of their place
and their name continue for ever the glory of the holy men
remaining unto their children
samuel the prophet of the lord the beloved of the lord his god
established a new government and anointed princes over his people
by the law of the lord he judged the congregation and the god of
and he was known to be faithful in his words because he saw the
and called upon the name of the lord almighty in fighting
against the enemies who beset him on every side when he offered a lamb
without blemish
and the lord thundered from heaven and with a great noise made
his voice to be heard
and he crushed the princes of the tyrians and all the lords of
the philistines
and before the time of the end of his life in the world he
protested before the lord and his anointed money or any thing else
even to a shoe he had not taken of any man and no man did accuse him
and after this he slept and he made known to the king and
shewed him the end of his life and he lifted up his voice from the
earth in prophecy to blot out the wickedness of the nation
punishment
then nathan the prophet arose in the days of david
and as the fat taken away from the flesh so was david chosen from
among the children of israel
he played with lions as with lambs and with bears he did in like
manner as with the lambs of the flock in his youth
did not he kill the giant and take away reproach from his people
in lifting up his hand with the stone in the sling he beat down
the boasting of goliath
for he called upon the lord the almighty and he gave strength in
his right hand to take away the mighty warrior and to set up the horn
of his nation
so in ten thousand did he glorify him and praised him in the
blessings of the lord in offering to him a crown of glory
for he destroyed the enemies on every side and extirpated the
in all his works he gave thanks to the holy one and to the most
with his whole heart he praised the lord and loved god that made
him and he gave him power against his enemies
and he set singers before the altar and by their voices he made
sweet melody
and to the festivals he added beauty and set in order the solemn
times even to the end of his life that they should praise the holy name
of the lord and magnify the holiness of god in the morning
the lord took away his sins and exalted his horn for ever and
he gave him a covenant of the kingdom and a throne of glory in israel
after him arose up a wise son and for his sake he cast down all
the power of the enemies
solomon reigned in days of peace and god brought all his enemies
under him that he might build a house in his name and prepare a
sanctuary for ever o how wise wast thou in thy youth
and thou wast filled as a river with wisdom and thy soul covered
the earth
and thou didst multiply riddles in parables thy name went abroad
to the islands far off and thou wast beloved in thy peace
the countries wondered at thee for thy canticles and proverbs
and parables and interpretations
and at the name of the lord god whose surname is god of israel
thou didst gather gold as copper and didst multiply silver as
lead
and thou didst bow thyself to women and by thy body thou wast
brought under subjection
thou hast stained thy glory and defiled thy seed so as to bring
wrath upon thy children and to have thy folly kindled
that thou shouldst make the kingdom to be divided and out of
but god will not leave off his mercy and he will not destroy
nor abolish his own works neither will he cut up by the roots the
offspring of his elect and he will not utterly take away the seed of
him that loveth the lord
wherefore he gave a remnant to jacob and to david of the same
stock
and solomon had an end with his fathers
and he left behind him of his seed the folly of the nation
even roboam that had little wisdom who turned away the people
through his counsel
and jeroboam the son of nabat who caused israel to sin and
shewed ephraim the way of sin and their sins were multiplied
exceedingly
they removed them far away from their land
and they sought out all iniquities till vengeance came upon
them and put an end to all their sins
and elias the prophet stood up as a fire and his word burnt like
a torch
he brought a famine upon them and they that provoked him in their
envy were reduced to a small number for they could not endure the
commandments of the lord
by the word of the lord he shut up the heaven and he brought down
fire from heaven thrice
thus was elias magnified in his wondrous works and who can glory
like to thee
who raisedst up a dead man from below from the lot of death by
the word of the lord god
who broughtest down kings to destruction and brokest easily their
power in pieces and the glorious from their bed
who heardest judgment in sina and in horeb the judgments of
vengeance
who anointedst kings to penance and madest prophets successors
after thee
who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire in a chariot of fiery
horses
who art registered in the judgments of times to appease the wrath
of the lord to reconcile the heart of the father to the son and to
restore the tribes of jacob
blessed are they that saw thee and were honoured with thy
friendship
for we live only in our life but after death our name shall not
be such
elias was indeed covered with the whirlwind and his spirit was
filled up in eliseus in his days he feared not the prince and no man
was more powerful than he
no word could overcome him and after death his body prophesied
in his life he did great wonders and in death he wrought
miracles
for all this the people repented not neither did they depart
from their sins till they were cast out of their land and were
scattered through all the earth
and there was left but a small people and a prince in the house
of david
some of these did that which pleased god but others committed
many sins
ezechias fortified his city and brought in water into the midst
thereof and he digged a rock with iron and made a well for water
in his days sennacherib came up and sent rabsaces and lifted up
his hand against them and he stretched out his hand against sion and
became proud through his power
then their hearts and hands trembled and they were in pain as
women in travail
and they called upon the lord who is merciful and spreading
their hands they lifted them up to heaven and the holy lord god
quickly heard their voice
he was not mindful of their sins neither did he deliver them up
to their enemies but he purified them by the hand of isaias the holy
prophet
he overthrew the army of the assyrians and the angel of the lord
destroyed them
for ezechias did that which pleased god and walked valiantly in
the way of david his father which isaias the great prophet and
faithful in the sight of god had commanded him
in his days the sun wen backward and he lengthened the kings
life
with a great spirit he saw the things that are to come to pass at
last and comforted the mourners in sion
he showed what should come to pass for ever and secret things
before they came
the memory of josias is like the composition of a sweet smell made
by the art of a perfumer
his remembrance shall be sweet as honey in every mouth and as
music at a banquet of wine
he was directed by god unto the repentance of the nation and he
took away the abominations of wickedness
and he directed his heart towards the lord and in the days of
sinners he strengthened godliness
except david and ezechias and josias all committed sin
for the kings of juda forsook the law of the most high and
despised the fear of god
so they gave their kingdom to others and their glory to a strange
nation
they burnt the chosen city of holiness and made the streets
thereof desolate according to the prediction of jeremias
for they treated him evil who was consecrated a prophet from his
mothers womb to overthrow and pluck up and destroy and to build
again and renew
it was ezechiel that saw the glorious vision which was shewn him
upon the chariot of cherubims
for he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain and
of doing good to them that shewed right ways
and may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up out of their
place for they strengthened jacob and redeemed themselves by strong
faith
how shall we magnify zorobabel for he was as a signet on the
right hand
in like manner jesus the son of josedec who in their days built
the house and set up a holy temple to the lord prepared for
everlasting glory
and let nehemias be a long time remembered who raised up for us
our walls that were cast down and set up the gates and the bars who
rebuilt our houses
no man was born upon earth like henoch for he also was taken up
from the earth
nor as joseph who was a man born prince of his brethren the
support of his family the ruler of his brethren the stay of the
people
and his bones were visited and after death they prophesied
verified the prophetic prediction of joseph gen
seth and sem obtained glory among men and above every soul adam
in the beginning
simon the high priest the son of onias who in his life propped
up the house and in his days fortified the temple
by him also the height of the temple was founded the double
building and the high walls of the temple
in his days the wells of water flowed out and they were filled as
the sea above measure
he took care of his nation and delivered it from destruction
he prevailed to enlarge the city and obtained glory in his
conversation with the people and enlarged the entrance of the house and
the court
he shone in his days as the morning star in the midst of a cloud
and as the moon at the full
and as the sun when it shineth so did he shine in the temple of
and as the rainbow giving light in bright clouds and as the
flower of roses in the days of the spring and as the lilies that are on
the brink of the water and as the sweet smelling frankincense in the
time of summer
as a bright fire and frankincense burning in the fire
as a massy vessel of gold adorned with every precious stone
as an olive tree budding forth and a cypress tree rearing itself
on high when he put on the robe of glory and was clothed with the
perfection of power
denoting his dignity and authority
when he went up to the holy altar he honoured the vesture of
holiness
and when he took the portions out of the hands of the priests he
himself stood by the altar and about him was the ring of his brethren
and as the cedar planted in mount libanus
and as branches of palm trees they stood round about him and
all the sons of aaron in their glory
and the oblation of the lord was in their hands before all the
congregation of israel and finishing his service on the altar to
honour the offering of the most high king
he stretched forth his hand to make a libation and offered of
the blood of the grape
he poured out at the foot of the altar a divine odour to the most
high prince
then the sons of aaron shouted they sounded with beaten
trumpets and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance before
then all the people together made haste and fell down to the
earth upon their faces to adore the lord their god and to pray to the
and the singers lifted up their voices and in the great house
the sound of sweet melody was increased
and the people in prayer besought the lord the most high until
the worship of the lord was perfected and they had finished their
office
then coming down he lifted up his hands over all the
congregation of the children of israel to give glory to god with his
lips and to glory in his name
and he repeated his prayer willing to shew the power of god
and now pray ye to the god of all who hath done great things in
all the earth who hath increased our days from our mothers womb and
hath done with us according to his mercy
may he grant us joyfulness of heart and that there be peace in
our days in israel for ever
that israel may believe that the mercy of god is with us to
deliver us in his days
there are two nations which my soul abhorreth and the third is
no nation which i hate
persecutors of his people such were then the edomites who abode in
mount seir the philistines and the samaritans who dwelt in sichem and
had their schismatical temple in that neighbourhood
they that sit on mount seir and the philistines and the foolish
people that dwell in sichem
jesus the son of sirach of jerusalem hath written in this book
the doctrine of wisdom and instruction who renewed wisdom from his
heart
blessed is he that is conversant in these good things and he that
layeth them up in his heart shall be wise always
for if he do them he shall be strong to do all things because
the light of god guideth his steps
a prayer of jesus the son of sirach i will give glory to thee o
i will give glory to thy name for thou hast been a helper and
protector to me
and hast preserved my body from destruction from the snare of an
unjust tongue and from the lips of them that forge lies and in the
sight of them that stood by thou hast been my helper
and thou hast delivered me according to the multitude of the
mercy of thy name from them that did roar prepared to devour
out of the hands of them that sought my life and from the gates
of afflictions which compassed me about
from the oppression of the flame which surrounded me and in the
midst of the fire i was not burnt
from the depth of the belly of hell and from an unclean tongue
and from lying words from an unjust king and from a slanderous tongue
my soul shall praise the lord even to death
and my life was drawing near to hell beneath
they compassed me on every side and there was no one that would
help me i looked for the succour of men and there was none
i remembered thy mercy o lord and thy works which are from the
beginning of the world
how thou deliverest them that wait for thee o lord and savest
them out of the hands of the nations
thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and i have
prayed for death to pass away
i called upon the lord the father of my lord that he would not
leave me in the day of my trouble and in the time of the proud without
help
i will praise thy name continually and will praise it with
thanksgiving and my prayer was heard
and thou hast saved me from destruction and hast delivered me
from the evil time
therefore i will give thanks and praise thee and bless the name
of the lord
when i was yet young before i wandered about i sought for
wisdom openly in my prayer
i prayed for her before the temple and unto the very end i will
seek after her and she flourished as a grape soon ripe
my heart delighted in her my foot walked in the right way from
my youth up i sought after her
i bowed down my ear a little and received her
i found much wisdom in myself and profited much therein
to him that giveth me wisdom will i give glory
for i have determined to follow her i have had a zeal for good
and shall not be confounded
my soul hath wrestled for her and in doing it i have been
confirmed
i stretched forth my hands on high and i bewailed my ignorance
of her
i directed my soul to her and in knowledge i found her
i possessed my heart with her from the beginning therefore i
shall not be forsaken
my entrails were troubled in seeking her therefore shall i
possess a good possession
the lord hath given me a tongue for my reward and with it i will
praise him
draw near to me ye unlearned and gather yourselves together
into the hours of discipline
why are ye slow and what do you say of these things your souls
are exceeding thirsty
i have opened my mouth and have spoken buy her for yourselves
without silver
and submit your neck to the yoke and let your soul receive
discipline for she is near at hand to be found
behold with your eyes how i have laboured a little and have
found much rest to myself
receive ye discipline as a great sum of money and possess
abundance of gold by her
let your soul rejoice in his mercy and you shall not be
confounded in his praise
work your work before the time and he will give you your reward
in his time

which he hath foretold so long before and in so clear a manner the
coming of christ the mysteries of our redemption the calling of the

wicked soninlaw king manasses for reproving his evil ways
