pulse and water their excellence and wisdom
in the third year of the reign of joakim king of juda
and the lord delivered into his hands joakim the king of juda and
part of the vessels of the house of god and he carried them away into
the land of sennaar to the house of his god and the vessels he brought
into the treasure house of his god
and the king spoke to asphenez the master of the eunuchs that he
should bring in some of the children of israel and of the kings seed
and of the princes
children in whom there was no blemish well favoured and skilful
in all wisdom acute in knowledge and instructed in science and such
as might stand in the kings palace that he might teach them the
learning and tongue of the chaldeans
and the king appointed them a daily provision of his own meat and
of the wine of which he drank himself that being nourished three years
afterwards they might stand before the king
now there was among them of the children of juda daniel ananias
and the master of the eunuchs gave them names to daniel
but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled with
the kings table nor with the wine which he drank and he requested the
master of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled
which had before been offered to idols
and god gave to daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the prince
of the eunuchs
and the prince of the eunuchs said to daniel i fear my lord the
king who hath appointed you meat and drink who if he should see your
faces leaner than those of the other youths your equals you shall
endanger my head to the king
and daniel said to malasar whom the prince of the eunuchs had
appointed over daniel ananias misael and azarias
try i beseech thee thy servants for ten days and let pulse be
given us to eat and water to drink
and look upon our faces and the faces of the children that eat of
the kings meat and as thou shalt see deal with thy servants
and when he had heard these words he tried them for ten days
and after ten days their faces appeared fairer and fatter than
all the children that ate of the kings meat
so malasar took their portions and the wine that they should
drink and he gave them pulse
and to these children god gave knowledge and understanding in
every book and wisdom but to daniel the understanding also of all
visions and dreams
and when the days were ended after which the king had ordered
they should be brought in the prince of the eunuchs brought them in
before nabuchodonosor
and when the king had spoken to them there were not found among
them all such as daniel ananias misael and azarias and they stood in
the kings presence
and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king
enquired of them he found them ten times better than all the diviners
and wise men that were in all his kingdom
and daniel continued even to the first year of king cyrus
the interpretation of it he is highly honoured by the king
in the second year of the reign of nabuchodonosor nabuchodonosor
had a dream and his spirit was terrified and his dream went out of his
mind
he had reigned before as partner with his father in the empire
then the king commanded to call together the diviners and the wise
men and the magicians and the chaldeans to declare to the king his
dreams so they came and stood before the king
stars
and the king said to them i saw a dream and being troubled in
mind i know not what i saw
and the chaldeans answered the king in syriac o king live for
ever tell to thy servants thy dream and we will declare the
interpretation thereof
and the king answering said to the chaldeans the thing is gone
out of my mind unless you tell me the dream and the meaning thereof
you shall be put to death and your houses shall be confiscated
but if you tell the dream and the meaning of it you shall receive
of me rewards and gifts and great honour therefore tell me the
dream and the interpretation thereof
they answered again and said let the king tell his servants the
dream and we will declare the interpretation of it
the king answered and said i know for certain that you seek to
gain time since you know that the thing is gone from me
if therefore you tell me not the dream there is one sentence
concerning you that you have also framed a lying interpretation and
full of deceit to speak before me till the time pass away tell me
therefore the dream that i may know that you also give a true
interpretation thereof
then the chaldeans answered before the king and said there is no
man upon earth that can accomplish thy word o king neither doth any
king though great and mighty ask such a thing of any diviner or wise
man or chaldean
for the thing that thou asketh o king is difficult nor can any
one be found that can shew it before the king except the gods whose
conversation is not with men
upon hearing this the king in fury and in great wrath commanded
that all the wise men of babylon should be put to death
and the decree being gone forth the wise men were slain and
then daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence of
wise men of babylon
and he asked him that had received the orders of the king why so
cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king and when
daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him
time to resolve the question and declare it to the king
and he went into his house and told the matter to ananias and
to the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the god of
heaven concerning this secret and that daniel and his companions might
not perish with the rest of the wise men of babylon
then was the mystery revealed to daniel by a vision in the night
and daniel blessed the god of heaven
and speaking he said blessed be the name of the lord from
eternity and for evermore for wisdom and fortitude are his
and he changeth times and ages taketh away kingdoms and
establisheth them giveth wisdom to the wise and knowledge to them that
have understanding
he revealeth deep and hidden things and knoweth what is in
darkness and light is with him
to thee o god of our fathers i give thanks and i praise thee
because thou hast given me wisdom and strength and now thou hast shewn
me what we desired of thee for thou hast made known to us the kings
discourse
after this daniel went in to arioch to whom the king had given
orders to destroy the wise men of babylon and he spoke thus to him
will tell the solution to the king
then arioch in haste brought in daniel to the king and said to
him i have found a man of the children of the captivity of juda that
will resolve the question to the king
the king answered and said to daniel whose name was baltassar
the interpretation thereof
and daniel made answer before the king and said the secret that
the king desireth to know none of the wise men or the philosophers or
the diviners or the soothsayers can declare to the king
but there is a god in heaven that revealeth mysteries who hath
shewn to thee o king nabuchodonosor what is to come to pass in the
latter times thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are
these
thou o king didst begin to think in thy bed what should come to
pass hereafter and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what shall
come to pass
to me also this secret is revealed not by any wisdom that i have
more than all men alive but that the interpretation might be made
manifest to the king and thou mightest know the thought of thy mind
thou o king sawest and behold there was as it were a great
statue this statue which was great and high tall of stature stood
before thee and the look thereof was terrible
the head of this statue was of fine gold but the breast and the
arms of silver and the belly and the thighs of brass
and the legs of iron the feet part of iron and part of clay
thus thou sawest till a stone was cut out of a mountain without
hands and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron
and clay and broke them in pieces
then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold
broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of a summers
threshing floor and they were carried away by the wind and there was
no place found for them but the stone that struck the statue became a
great mountain and filled the whole earth
this is the dream we will also tell the interpretation thereof
before thee o king
thou art a king of kings and the god of heaven hath given thee a
kingdom and strength and power and glory
and all places wherein the children of men and the beasts of the
field do dwell he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand
and hath put all things under thy power thou therefore art the head
of gold
and after thee shall rise up another kingdom inferior to thee of
silver and another third kingdom of brass which shall rule over all
the world
kingdom viz that of alexander the great
and the fourth kingdom shall be as iron as iron breaketh into
pieces and subdueth all things so shall that break and destroy all
these
its civil wars
and whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes part of potters
clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but yet it shall
take its origin from the iron according as thou sawest the iron mixed
with the miry clay
and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay
the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken
and whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay they shall
be mingled indeed together with the seed of man but they shall not
stick fast one to another as iron cannot be mixed with clay
but in the days of those kingdoms the god of heaven will set up a
kingdom that shall never by destroyed and his kingdom shall not be
delivered up to another people and it shall break in pieces and shall
consume all these kingdoms and itself shall stand for ever
cannot be destroyed
according as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
mountain without hands and broke in pieces the clay and the iron and
the brass and the silver and the gold the great god hath shewn the
king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is true and the
interpretation thereof is faithful
then king nabuchodonosor fell on his face and worshipped daniel
and commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and
incense
and the king spoke to daniel and said verily your god is the
thou couldst discover this secret
then the king advanced daniel to a high station and gave him many
and great gifts and he made him governor over all the provinces of
and daniel requested of the king and he appointed sidrach
the three children for refusing to do it are cast into the fiery
furnace but are not hurt by the flames their prayer and canticle of
praise
king nabuchodonosor made a statue of gold of sixty cubits high
and six cubits broad and he set it up in the plain of dura of the
province of babylon
then nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles
the magistrates and the judges the captains the rulers and
governors and all the chief men of the provinces to come to the
dedication of the statue which king nabuchodonosor had set up
then the nobles the magistrates and the judges the captains and
rulers and the great men that were placed in authority and all the
princes of the provinces were gathered together to come to the
dedication of the statue which king nabuchodonosor had set up and they
stood before the statue which king nabuchodonosor had set up
then a herald cried with a strong voice to you it is commanded o
nations tribes and languages
that in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet and
of the flute and of the harp of the sackbut and of the psaltery and
of the symphony and of all kind of music ye fall down and adore the
golden statue which king nabuchodonosor hath set up
but if any man shall not fall down and adore he shall the same
hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire
upon this therefore at the time when all the people heard the
sound of the trumpet the flute and the harp of the sackbut and the
psaltery of the symphony and of all kind of music all the nations
tribes and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king
and presently at that very time some chaldeans came and accused the
and said to king nabuchodonosor o king live for ever
thou o king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear
the sound of the trumpet the flute and the harp of the sackbut and
the psaltery of the symphony and of all kind of music shall prostrate
himself and adore the golden statue
and that if any man shall not fall down and adore he should be
cast into a furnace of burning fire
now there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the works of
the province of babylon sidrach misach and abdenago these men o
king have slighted thy decree they worship not thy gods nor do they
adore the golden statue which thou hast set up
then nabuchodonosor in fury and in wrath commanded that sidrach
before the king
and nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them and said is it true
adore the golden statue that i have set up
now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall
hear the sound of the trumpet flute harp sackbut and psaltery and
symphony and of all kind of music prostrate yourselves and adore the
statue which i have made but if you do not adore you shall be cast the
same hour into the furnace of burning fire and who is the god that
shall deliver you out of my hand
sidrach misach and abdenago answered and said to king
matter
for behold our god whom we worship is able to save us from the
furnace of burning fire and to deliver us out of thy hands o king
but if he will not be it known to thee o king that we will not
worship thy gods nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up
then was nabuchodonosor filled with fury and the countenance of
his face was changed against sidrach misach and abdenago and he
commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it had
been accustomed to be heated
and he commanded the strongest men that were in his army to bind
the feet of sidrach misach and abdenago and to cast them into the
furnace of burning fire
and immediately these men were bound and were cast into the
furnace of burning fire with their coats and their caps and their
shoes and their garments
for the kings commandment was urgent and the furnace was heated
exceedingly and the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in
but these three men that is sidrach misach and abdenago fell
down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire
and they walked in the midst of the flame praising god and
blessing the lord
verse to ver was not in the hebrew in his time but as it was in
all the greek bibles which were originally translated from the
written but this is certain that it is and has been of old received
by the church and read as canonical scripture in her liturgy and
divine offices
then azarias standing up prayed in this manner and opening his
mouth in the midst of the fire he said
blessed art thou o lord the god of our fathers and thy name is
worthy of praise and glorious for ever
for thou art just in all that thou hast done to us and all thy
works are true and thy ways right and all thy judgments true
for thou hast executed true judgments in all the things that thou
hast brought upon us and upon jerusalem the holy city of our fathers
for according to truth and judgment thou hast brought all these things
upon us for our sins
for we have sinned and committed iniquity departing from thee
and we have trespassed in all things
and we have not hearkened to thy commandments nor have we
observed nor done as thou hadst commanded us that it might go well with
us
wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us and every thing
that thou hast done to us thou hast done in true judgment
and thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies that are
unjust and most wicked and prevaricators and to a king unjust and
most wicked beyond all that are upon the earth
and now we cannot open our mouths we are become a shame and a
reproach to thy servants and to them that worship thee
deliver us not up for ever we beseech thee for thy names sake
and abolish not thy covenant
and take not away thy mercy from us for the sake of abraham thy
beloved and isaac thy servant and israel thy holy one
to whom thou hast spoken promising that thou wouldst multiply
their seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the sea
shore
for we o lord are diminished more than any nation and are
brought low in all the earth this day for our sins
neither is there at this time prince or leader or prophet or
holocaust or sacrifice or oblation or incense or place of first
fruits before thee
that we may find thy mercy nevertheless in a contrite heart and
humble spirit let us be accepted
as in holocausts of rams and bullocks and as in thousands of fat
lambs so let our sacrifice be made in thy sight this day that it may
please thee for there is no confusion to them that trust in thee
and now we follow thee with all our heart and we fear thee and
seek thy face
put us not to confusion but deal with us according to thy
meekness and according to the multitude of thy mercies
and deliver us according to thy wonderful works and give glory
to thy name o lord
and let all them be confounded that shew evils to thy servants
let them be confounded in all thy might and let their strength be
broken
and let them know that thou art the lord the only god and
glorious over all the world
now the kings servants that had cast them in ceased not to heat
the furnace with brimstone and tow and pitch and dry sticks
and the flame mounted up above the furnace nine and forty cubits
and it broke forth and burnt such of the chaldeans as it found
near the furnace
but the angel of the lord went down with azarias and his
companions into the furnace and he drove the flame of the fire out of
the furnace
and made the midst of the furnace like the blowing of a wind
bringing dew and the fire touched them not at all nor troubled them
nor did them any harm
then these three as with one mouth praised and glorified and
blessed god in the furnace saying
blessed art thou o lord the god of our fathers and worthy to be
praised and glorified and exalted above all for ever and blessed is
the holy name of thy glory and worthy to be praised and exalted above
all in all ages
blessed art thou in the holy temple of thy glory and exceedingly
glorious for ever
blessed art thou on the throne of thy kingdom and exceedingly
to be praised and exalted above all for ever

cherubims and worthy to be praised and exalted above all for ever

out of the hand of death and delivered us out of the midst of the
burning flame and saved us out of the midst of the fire
o give thanks to the lord because he is good because his mercy
endureth for ever and ever
o all ye religious bless the lord the god of gods praise him
and give him thanks because his mercy endureth for ever and ever
then nabuchodonosor the king was astonished and rose up in
haste and said to his nobles did we not cast three men bound into the
midst of the fire they answered the king and said true o king
he answered and said behold i see four men loose and walking
in the midst of the fire and there is no hurt in them and the form of
the fourth is like the son of god
then nabuchodonosor came to the door of the burning fiery furnace
and said sidrach misach and abdenago ye servants of the most high
and the nobles and the magistrates and the judges and the great
men of the king being gathered together considered these men that the
fire had no power on their bodies and that not a hair of their head had
been singed nor their garments altered nor the smell of the fire had
passed on them
then nabuchodonosor breaking forth said blessed be the god of
them to wit of sidrach misach and abdenago who hath sent his angel
and delivered his servants that believed in him and they changed the
kings word and delivered up their bodies that they might not serve
nor adore any god except their own god
by me therefore this decree is made that every people tribe
and tongue which shall speak blasphemy against the god of sidrach
for there is no other god that can save in this manner
then the king promoted sidrach misach and abdenago in the
province of babylon
nabuchodonosor the king to all peoples nations and tongues
that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you
the following chapter which is written in the style of an epistle from
the king
the most high god hath wrought signs and wonders towards me it
hath seemed good to me therefore to publish
his signs because they are great and his wonders because they
are mighty and his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his power to
all generations
against him for his pride is interpreted by daniel and verified by the
event
i nabuchodonosor was at rest in my house and flourishing in my
palace
i saw a dream that affrighted me and my thoughts in my bed and
the visions of my head troubled me
then i set forth a decree that all the wise men of babylon should
be brought in before me and that they should shew me the interpretation
of the dream
then came in the diviners the wise men the chaldeans and the
soothsayers and i told the dream before them but they did not shew me
the interpretation thereof
till their colleague daniel came in before me whose name is
of the holy gods and i told the dream before him
name of baltassar or belteshazzar is derived from the name of bel the
chief god of the babylonians
baltassar prince of the diviners because i know that thou hast in
thee the spirit of the holy gods and that no secret is impossible to
thee tell me the visions of my dreams that i have seen and the
interpretation of them
this was the vision of my head in my bed i saw and behold a tree
in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was exceeding great
the tree was great and strong and the height thereof reached unto
heaven the sight thereof was even to the ends of all the earth
its leaves were most beautiful and its fruit exceeding much and
in it was food for all under it dwelt cattle and beasts and in the
branches thereof the fowls of the air had their abode and all flesh did
eat of it
i saw in the vision of my head upon my bed and behold a watcher
and a holy one came down from heaven
he cried aloud and said thus cut down the tree and chop off the
branches thereof shake off its leaves and scatter its fruits let the
beasts fly away that are under it and the birds from its branches
nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth and let
it be tied with a band of iron and of brass among the grass that is
without and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let its portion
be with the wild beasts in the grass of the earth
let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be
given him and let seven times pass over him
changed into an ox but only that he lost his reason and became mad
and in this condition remained abroad in the company of beasts eating
grass like an ox till his hair grew in such manner as to resemble the
feathers of eagles and his nails to be like birds claws
this is the decree by the sentence of the watchers and the word
and demand of the holy ones till the living know that the most high
ruleth in the kingdom of men and he will give it to whomsoever it shall
please him and he will appoint the basest man over it
i king nabuchodonosor saw this dream thou therefore o
my kingdom are not able to declare the meaning of it to me but thou art
able because the spirit of the holy gods is in thee
then daniel whose name was baltassar began silently to think
within himself for about one hour and his thought troubled him but the
king answering said baltassar let not the dream and the
interpretation thereof trouble thee baltassar answered and said my
lord the dream be to them that hate thee and the interpretation
thereof to thy enemies
the tree which thou sawest which was high and strong whose
height reached to the skies and the sight thereof into all the earth
and the branches thereof were most beautiful and its fruit
exceeding much and in it was food for all under which the beasts of
the field dwelt and the birds of the air had their abode in its
branches
it is thou o king who art grown great and become mighty for
thy greatness hath grown and hath reached to heaven and thy power unto
the ends of the earth
and whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one come down from
heaven and say cut down the tree and destroy it but leave the stump
of the roots thereof in the earth and let it be bound with iron and
brass among the grass without and let it be sprinkled with the dew of
heaven and let his feeding be with the wild beasts till seven times
pass over him
this is the interpretation of the sentence of the most high which
is come upon my lord the king
they shall cast thee out from among men and thy dwelling shall be
with cattle and with wild beasts and thou shalt eat grass as an ox
and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over
thee till thou know that the most high ruleth over the kingdom of men
and giveth it to whomsoever he will
but whereas he commanded that the stump of the roots thereof
that is of the tree should be left thy kingdom shall remain to thee
after thou shalt have known that power is from heaven
wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable to thee and
redeem thou thy sins with alms and thy iniquities with works of mercy
to the poor perhaps he will forgive thy offences
all these things came upon king nabuchodonosor
at the end of twelve months he was walking in the palace of
and the king answered and said is not this the great babylon
which i have built to be the seat of the kingdom by the strength of my
power and in the glory of my excellence
and while the word was yet in the kings mouth a voice came down
from heaven to thee o king nabuchodonosor it is said thy kingdom
shall pass from thee
and they shall cast thee out from among men and thy dwelling
shall be with cattle and wild beasts thou shalt eat grass like an ox
and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the most high
ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will
the same hour the word was fulfilled upon nabuchodonosor and he
was driven away from among men and did eat grass like an ox and his
body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs grew like the
feathers of eagles and his nails like birds claws
now at the end of the days i nabuchodonosor lifted up my eyes
to heaven and my sense was restored to me and i blessed the most high
and i praised and glorified him that liveth for ever for his power is
an everlasting power and his kingdom is to all generations
and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before
him for he doth according to his will as well with the powers of
heaven as among the inhabitants of the earth and there is none that
can resist his hand and say to him why hast thou done it
at the same time my sense returned to me and i came to the honour
and glory of my kingdom and my shape returned to me and my nobles and
my magistrates sought for me and i was restored to my kingdom and
greater majesty was added to me
therefore i nabuchodonosor do now praise and magnify and
glorify the king of heaven because all his works are true and his ways
judgments and them that walk in pride he is able to abase
infer that this king became a true convert and dying not long after
was probably saved
on the wall which daniel reads and interprets
baltasar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his
nobles and every one drank according to his age
etc according to the style of the scriptures because he was a
descendant from him
and being now drunk he commanded that they should bring the
vessels of gold and silver which nabuchodonosor his father had
brought away out of the temple that was in jerusalem that the king and
his nobles and his wives and his concubines might drink in them
then were the golden and silver vessels brought which he had
brought away out of the temple that was in jerusalem and the king and
his nobles his wives and his concubines drank in them
they drank wine and praised their gods of gold and of silver of
brass of iron and of wood and of stone
in the same hour there appeared fingers as it were of the hand of
a man writing over against the candlestick upon the surface of the
wall of the kings palace and the king beheld the joints of the hand
that wrote
then was the kings countenance changed and his thoughts troubled
him and the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees struck one
against the other
and the king cried out aloud to bring in the wise men the
men of babylon whosoever shall read this writing and shall make known
to me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with purple and
shall have a golden chain on his neck and shall be the third man in my
kingdom
then came in all the kings wise men but they could neither read
the writing nor declare the interpretation to the king
wherewith king baltasar was much troubled and his countenance was
changed and his nobles also were troubled
then the queen on occasion of what had happened to the king and
his nobles came into the banquethouse and she spoke and said o
king live for ever let not thy thoughts trouble thee neither let thy
countenance be changed
there is a man in thy kingdom that hath the spirit of the holy
gods in him and in the days of thy father knowledge and wisdom were
found in him for king nabuchodonosor thy father appointed him prince
of the wise men enchanters chaldeans and soothsayers thy father i
say o king
because a greater spirit and knowledge and understanding and
interpretation of dreams and shewing of secrets and resolving of
difficult things were found in him that is in daniel whom the king
named baltassar now therefore let daniel be called for and he will
tell the interpretation
then daniel was brought in before the king and the king spoke
and said to him art thou daniel of the children of the captivity of
i have heard of thee that thou hast the spirit of the gods and
excellent knowledge and understanding and wisdom are found in thee
and now the wise men the magicians have come in before me to
read this writing and shew me the interpretation thereof and they
could not declare to me the meaning of this writing
but i have heard of thee that thou canst interpret obscure
things and resolve difficult things now if thou art able to read the
writing and to shew me the interpretation thereof thou shalt be
clothed with purple and shalt have a chain of gold about thy neck and
shalt be the third prince in my kingdom
to which daniel made answer and said before the king thy rewards
be to thyself and the gifts of thy house give to another but the
writing i will read to thee o king and shew thee the interpretation
thereof
o king the most high god gave to nabuchodonosor thy father a
kingdom and greatness and glory and honour
and for the greatness that he gave to him all people tribes and
languages trembled and were afraid of him whom he would he slew and
whom he would he destroyed and whom he would he set up and whom he
would he brought down
but when his heart was lifted up and his spirit hardened unto
pride he was put down from the throne of his kingdom and his glory was
taken away
and he was driven out from the sons of men and his heart was
made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses and he
did eat grass like an ox and his body was wet with the dew of heaven
till he knew that the most high ruled in the kingdom of men and that he
will set over it whomsoever it shall please him
thou also his son o baltasar hast not humbled thy heart
whereas thou knewest all these things
but hast lifted thyself up against the lord of heaven and the
vessels of his house have been brought before thee and thou and thy
nobles and thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine in them and
thou hast praised the gods of silver and of gold and of brass of
iron and of wood and of stone that neither see nor hear nor feel
but the god who hath thy breath in his hand and all thy ways thou hast
not glorified
wherefore he hath sent the part of the hand which hath written
this that is set down
and this is the writing that is written mane thecel phares
and this is the interpretation of the word mane god hath
numbered thy kingdom and hath finished it
thecel thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting
phares thy kingdom is divided and is given to the medes and
then by the kings command daniel was clothed with purple and a
chain of gold was put about his neck and it was proclaimed of him that
he had power as the third man in the kingdom
the same night baltasar the chaldean king was slain
and darius the mede succeeded to the kingdom being threescore
and two years old
prayer for the transgression of this law daniel is cast into the lions
den but miraculously delivered
it seemed good to darius and he appointed over the kingdom a
hundred and twenty governors to be over his whole kingdom
and three princes over them of whom daniel was one that the
governors might give an account to them and the king might have no
trouble
and daniel excelled all the princes and governors because a
greater spirit of god was in him
and the king thought to set him over all the kingdom whereupon the
princes and the governors sought to find occasion against daniel with
regard to the king and they could find no cause nor suspicion because
he was faithful and no fault nor suspicion was found in him
then these men said we shall not find any occasion against this
then the princes and the governors craftily suggested to the
king and spoke thus unto him king darius live for ever
all the princes of the kingdom the magistrates and governors the
senators and judges have consulted together that an imperial decree
and an edict be published that whosoever shall ask any petition of any
god or man for thirty days but of thee o king shall be cast into
the den of the lions
now therefore o king confirm the sentence and sign the decree
that what is decreed by the medes and persians may not be altered nor
any man be allowed to transgress it
so king darius set forth the decree and established it
now when daniel knew this that is to say that the law was made
he went into his house and opening the windows in his upper chamber
towards jerusalem he knelt down three times a day and adored and gave
thanks before his god as he had been accustomed to do before
wherefore those men carefully watching him found daniel praying
and making supplication to his god
and they came and spoke to the king concerning the edict o king
hast thou not decreed that every man that should make a request to any
of the gods or men for thirty days but to thyself o king should be
cast into the den of the lions and the king answered them saying the
word is true according to the decree of the medes and persians which
it is not lawful to violate
then they answered and said before the king daniel who is of
the children of the captivity of juda hath not regarded thy law nor
the decree that thou hast made but three times a day he maketh his
prayer
now when the king had heard these words he was very much grieved
and in behalf of daniel he set his heart to deliver him and even till
sunset he laboured to save him
but those men perceiving the kings design said to him know
thou o king that the law of the medes and persians is that no decree
which the king hath made may be altered
then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him
into the den of the lions and the king said to daniel thy god whom
thou always servest he will deliver thee
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den which
the king sealed with his own ring and with the ring of his nobles that
nothing should be done against daniel
and the king went away to his house and laid himself down without
taking supper and meat was not set before him and even sleep departed
from him
then the king rising very early in the morning went in haste to
the lions den
and coming near to the den cried with a lamentable voice to
from the lions
and daniel answering the king said o king live for ever
my god hath sent his angel and hath shut up the mouths of the
lions and they have not hurt me forasmuch as before him justice hath
been found in me yea and before thee o king i have done no offence
then was the king exceeding glad for him and he commanded that
den and no hurt was found in him because he believed in his god
and by the kings commandment those men were brought that had
accused daniel and they were cast into the lions den they and their
children and their wives and they did not reach the bottom of the den
before the lions caught them and broke all their bones in pieces
then king darius wrote to all people tribes and languages
dwelling in the whole earth peace be multiplied unto you
it is decreed by me that in all my empire and my kingdom all men
dread and fear the god of daniel for he is the living and eternal god
for ever and his kingdom shall not be destroyed and his power shall be
for ever
he is the deliverer and saviour doing signs and wonders in
heaven and in earth who hath delivered daniel out of the lions den
now daniel continued unto the reign of darius and the reign of
sitting on his throne and of the opposite kingdoms of christ and
in the first year of baltasar king of babylon daniel saw a dream
and the vision of his head was upon his bed and writing the dream he
comprehended it in a few words and relating the sum of it in short he
said
i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the
heavens strove upon the great sea
and four great beasts different one from another came up out of
the sea
empires but some rather choose to understand the fourth beast of the
successors of alexander the great more especially of them that reigned
in asia and syria
the first was like a lioness and had the wings of an eagle i
beheld till her wings were plucked off and she was lifted up from the
earth and stood upon her feet as a man and the heart of a man was
given to her
and behold another beast like a bear stood up on one side and
there were three rows in the mouth thereof and in the teeth thereof
and thus they said to it arise devour much flesh
after this i beheld and lo another like a leopard and it had
upon it four wings as of a fowl and the beast had four heads and
power was given to it
after this i beheld in the vision of the night and lo a fourth
beast terrible and wonderful and exceeding strong it had great iron
teeth eating and breaking in pieces and treading down the rest with
his feet and it was unlike to the other beasts which i had seen before
it and had ten horns
empire of the fourth beast shall be parcelled or ten kings of the
number of the successors of alexander as figures of such as shall be
about the time of antichrist
i considered the horns and behold another little horn sprung out
of the midst of them and three of the first horns were plucked up at
the presence thereof and behold eyes like the eyes of a man were in
this horn and a mouth speaking great things
also be applied to that great persecutor antiochus epiphanes as a
figure of antichrist
i beheld till thrones were placed and the ancient of days sat his
garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like clean wool his
throne like flames of fire the wheels of it like a burning fire
a swift stream of fire issued forth from before him thousands of
thousands ministered to him and ten thousand times a hundred thousand
stood before him the judgment sat and the books were opened
i beheld because of the voice of the great words which that horn
spoke and i saw that the beast was slain and the body thereof was
destroyed and given to the fire to be burnt
and that the power of the other beasts was taken away and that
times of life were appointed them for a time and a time
i beheld therefore in the vision of the night and lo one like
the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and he came even to the
ancient of days and they presented him before him
and he gave him power and glory and a kingdom and all peoples
tribes and tongues shall serve him his power is an everlasting power
that shall not be taken away and his kingdom that shall not be
destroyed
my spirit trembled i daniel was affrighted at these things and
the visions of my head troubled me
i went near to one of them that stood by and asked the truth of
him concerning all these things and he told me the interpretation of
the words and instructed me
these four great beasts are four kingdoms which shall arise out
of the earth
but the saints of the most high god shall take the kingdom and
they shall possess the kingdom for ever and ever
after this i would diligently learn concerning the fourth beast
which was very different from all and exceeding terrible his teeth and
claws were of iron he devoured and broke in pieces and the rest he
stamped upon with his feet
and concerning the ten horns that he had on his head and
concerning the other that came up before which three horns fell and of
that horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking great things and was
greater than the rest
i beheld and lo that horn made war against the saints and
prevailed over them
till the ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of
the most high and the time came and the saints obtained the kingdom
and thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
upon earth which shall be greater than all the kingdoms and shall
devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces
and the ten horns of the same kingdom shall be ten kings and
another shall rise up after them and he shall be mightier than the
former and he shall bring down three kings
and he shall speak words against the high one and shall crush the
saints of the most high and he shall think himself able to change times
and laws and they shall be delivered into his hand until a time and
times and half a time
which is supposed to be the length of the duration of the persecution of
and a judgment shall sit that his power may be taken away and be
broken in pieces and perish even to the end
and that the kingdom and power and the greatness of the kingdom
under the whole heaven may be given to the people of the saints of the
most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all kings shall
serve him and shall obey him
hitherto is the end of the word i daniel was much troubled with
my thoughts and my countenance was changed in me but i kept the word
in my heart
in the third year of the reign of king baltasar a vision appeared
to me i daniel after what i had seen in the beginning
saw in my vision when i was in the castle of susa which is in the
province of elam and i saw in the vision that i was over the gate of
and i lifted up my eyes and saw and behold a ram stood before the
water having two high horns and one higher than the other and growing
up afterward
i saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west and against
the north and against the south and no beasts could withstand him nor
be delivered out of his hand and he did according to his own will and
became great
and i understood and behold a hegoat came from the west on the
face of the whole earth and he touched not the ground and the hegoat
had a notable horn between his eyes
not the ground he conquered all before him with so much rapidity
that he seemed rather to fly than to walk upon the earthibid a
notable horn alexander the great
and he went up to the ram that had the horns which i had seen
standing before the gate and he ran towards him in the force of his
strength
and when he was come near the ram he was enraged against him and
struck the ram and broke his two horns and the ram could not withstand
him and when he had cast him down on the ground he stamped upon him
and none could deliver the ram out of his hand
and the hegoat became exceeding great and when he was grown the
great horn was broken and there came up four horns under it towards the
four winds of heaven
of alexander who divided his empire among them
and out of one of them came forth a little horn and it became
great against the south and against the east and against the strength
against the south and the east by his victories over the kings of
and the people of god
and it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven and it
threw down of the strength and of the stars and trod upon them
are here called the army of the jews the people of god
and it was magnified even to the prince of the strength and it
took away from him the continual sacrifice and cast down the place of
his sanctuary
and strength was given him against the continual sacrifice
because of sins and truth shall be cast down on the ground and he
shall do and shall prosper
and i heard one of the saints speaking and one saint said to
another i know not to whom that was speaking how long shall be the
vision concerning the continual sacrifice and the sin of the
desolation that is made and the sanctuary and the strength be trodden
under foot
and he said to him unto evening and morning two thousand three
hundred days and the sanctuary shall be cleansed
years and almost four months which was the whole time from the
beginning of the persecution of antiochus till his death
and it came to pass when i daniel saw the vision and sought the
meaning that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of
a man
and i heard the voice of a man between ulai and he called and
said gabriel make this man to understand the vision
and he came and stood near where i stood and when he was come i
fell on my face trembling and he said to me understand o son of man
for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled
and when he spoke to me i fell flat on the ground and he touched
me and set me upright
and he said to me i will shew thee what things are to come to
pass in the end of the malediction for the time hath its end
the ram which thou sawest with horns is the king of the medes
and persians
and the hegoat is the king of the greeks and the great horn
that was between his eyes the same is the first king
but whereas when that was broken there arose up four for it four
kings shall rise up of his nation but not with his strength
and after their reign when iniquities shall be grown up there
shall arise a king of a shameless face and understanding dark
sentences
and his power shall be strengthened but not by his own force and
he shall lay all things waste and shall prosper and do more than can
be believed and he shall destroy the mighty and the people of the
saints
according to his will and craft shall be successful in his hand
and his heart shall be puffed up and in the abundance of all things he
shall kill many and he shall rise up against the prince of princes and
shall be broken without hand
and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is
true thou therefore seal up the vision because it shall come to pass
after many days
and i daniel languished and was sick for some days and when i
was risen up i did the kings business and i was astonished at the
vision and there was none that could interpret it
seventy weeks to the coming of christ
in the first year of darius the son of assuerus of the seed of
the medes who reigned over the kingdom of the chaldeans
the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the
number of the years concerning which the word of the lord came to
desolation of jerusalem
and i set my face to the lord my god to pray and make
supplication with fasting and sackcloth and ashes
and i prayed to the lord my god and i made my confession and
said i beseech thee o lord god great and terrible who keepest the
covenant and mercy to them that love thee and keep thy commandments
we have sinned we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly
and have revolted and we have gone aside from thy commandments and thy
judgments
we have not hearkened to thy servants the prophets that have
spoken in thy name to our kings to our princes to our fathers and to
all the people of the land
to thee o lord justice but to us confusion of face as at this
day to the men of juda and to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to all
countries whither thou hast driven them for their iniquities by which
they have sinned against thee
o lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our princes and to
our fathers that have sinned
but to thee the lord our god mercy and forgiveness for we have
departed from thee
and we have not hearkened to the voice of the lord our god to
walk in his law which he set before us by his servants the prophets
and all israel have transgressed thy law and have turned away
from hearing thy voice and the malediction and the curse which is
written in the book of moses the servant of god is fallen upon us
because we have sinned against him
and he hath confirmed his words which he spoke against us and
against our princes that judged us that he would bring in upon us a
great evil such as never was under all the heaven according to that
which hath been done in jerusalem
as it is written in the law of moses all this evil is come upon
us and we entreated not thy face o lord our god that we might turn
from our iniquities and think on thy truth
and the lord hath watched upon the evil and hath brought it upon
us the lord our god is just in all his works which he hath done for
we have not hearkened to his voice
and now o lord our god who hast brought forth thy people out of
the land of egypt with a strong hand and hast made thee a name as at
this day we have sinned we have committed iniquity
o lord against all thy justice let thy wrath and thy indignation
be turned away i beseech thee from thy city jerusalem and from thy
holy mountain for by reason of our sins and the iniquities of our
fathers jerusalem and thy people are a reproach to all that are round
about us
now therefore o our god hear the supplication of thy servant
and his prayers and shew thy face upon thy sanctuary which is
desolate for thy own sake
incline o my god thy ear and hear open thy eyes and see our
desolation and the city upon which thy name is called for it is not
for our justifications that we present our prayers before thy face but
for the multitude of thy tender mercies
o lord hear o lord be appeased hearken and do delay not for
thy own sake o my god because thy name is invocated upon thy city and
upon thy people
now while i was yet speaking and praying and confessing my sins
and the sins of my people of israel and presenting my supplications in
the sight of my god for the holy mountain of my god
as i was yet speaking in prayer behold the man gabriel whom i
had seen in the vision at the beginning flying swiftly touched me at
the time of the evening sacrifice
and he instructed me and spoke to me and said o daniel i am
now come forth to teach thee and that thou mightest understand
from the beginning of thy prayers the word came forth and i am
come to shew it to thee because thou art a man of desires therefore
do thou mark the word and understand the vision
captivity
seventy weeks are shortened upon thy people and upon thy holy
city that transgression may be finished and sin may have an end and
iniquity may be abolished and everlasting justice may be brought and
vision and prophecy may be fulfilled and the saint of saints may be
anointed
years are shortened that is fixed and determined so that the time
shall be no longer
know thou therefore and take notice that from the going forth
of the word to build up jerusalem again unto christ the prince there
shall be seven weeks and sixtytwo weeks and the street shall be built
again and the walls in straitness of times
year of king artaxerxes when by his commandment nehemias rebuilt the
walls of jerusalem esd from which time according to the best
chronology there were just sixtynine weeks of years that is
years to the baptism of christ when he first began to preach and
execute the office of messiasibid in straitness of times angustia
temporum which may allude both to the difficulties and opposition they
met with in building and to the shortness of the time in which they
finished the wall viz fiftytwo days
and after sixtytwo weeks christ shall be slain and the people
that shall deny him shall not be his and a people with their leader
that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end
thereof shall be waste and after the end of the war the appointed
desolation
and he shall confirm the covenant with many in one week and in
the half of the week the victim and the sacrifice shall fail and there
shall be in the temple the abomination of desolation and the desolation
shall continue even to the consummation and to the end
the cross abolished all the sacrifices of the lawibid the abomination
of desolation some understand this of the profanation of the temple
by the crimes of the jews and by the bloody faction of the zealots
desolation viz that under antiochus that when the temple was
destroyed by the romans and the last near the end of the world under
relation
with which he is much terrified but he is comforted by an angel
in the third year of cyrus king of the persians a word was
revealed to daniel surnamed baltassar and a true word and great
strength and he understood the word for there is need of understanding
in a vision
in those days i daniel mourned the days of three weeks
i ate no desirable bread and neither flesh nor wine entered
into my mouth neither was i anointed with ointment till the days of
three weeks were accomplished
and in the four and twentieth day of the first month i was by the
great river which is the tigris
and i lifted up my eyes and i saw and behold a man clothed in
linen and his loins were girded with the finest gold
and his body was like the chrysolite and his face as the
appearance of lightning and his eyes as a burning lamp and his arms
and all downward even to the feet like in appearance to glittering
brass and the voice of his word like the voice of a multitude
and i daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me
saw it not but an exceeding great terror fell upon them and they fled
away and hid themselves
and i being left alone saw this great vision and there remained
no strength in me and the appearance of my countenance was changed in
me and i fainted away and retained no strength
and i heard the voice of his words and when i heard i lay in a
consternation upon my face and my face was close to the ground
and behold a hand touched me and lifted me up upon my knees and
upon the joints of my hands
and he said to me daniel thou man of desires understand the
words that i speak to thee and stand upright for i am sent now to
thee and when he had said this word to me i stood trembling
and he said to me fear not daniel for from the first day that
thou didst set thy heart to understand to afflict thyself in the sight
of thy god thy words have been heard and i am come for thy words
but the prince of the kingdom of the persians resisted me one and
twenty days and behold michael one of the chief princes came to help
me and i remained there by the king of the persians
to his office seeking the spiritual good of the persians was desirous
that many of the jews should remain among them
but i am come to teach thee what things shall befall thy people
in the latter days for as yet the vision is for days
and when he was speaking such words to me i cast down my
countenance to the ground and held my peace
and behold as it were the likeness of a son of man touched my
lips then i opened my mouth and spoke and said to him that stood
before me o my lord at the sight of thee my joints are loosed and no
strength hath remained in me
and how can the servant of my lord speak with my lord for no
strength remaineth in me moreover my breath is stopped
therefore he that looked like a man touched me again and
strengthened me
and he said fear not o man of desires peace be to thee take
courage and be strong and when he spoke to me i grew strong and i
said speak o my lord for thou hast strengthened me
and he said dost thou know wherefore i am come to thee and now
forth there appeared the prince of the greeks coming
but i will tell thee what is set down in the scripture of truth
and none is my helper in all these things but michael your prince
figure of antichrist
and from the first year of darius the mede i stood up that he
might be strengthened and confirmed
and now i will shew thee the truth behold there shall stand yet
three kings in persia and the fourth shall be enriched exceedingly
above them all and when he shall be grown mighty by his riches he
shall stir up all against the kingdom of greece
but there shall rise up a strong king and shall rule with great
power and he shall do what he pleaseth
and when he shall come to his height his kingdom shall be broken
and it shall be divided towards the four winds of the heaven but not to
his posterity nor according to his power with which he ruled for his
kingdom shall be rent in pieces even for strangers besides these
and the king of the south shall be strengthened and one of his
princes shall prevail over him and he shall rule with great power for
his dominions shall be great
which lies south of jerusalemibid one of his princes that is one
of alexanders princes shall prevail over him that is shall be
stronger than the king of egypt he speaks of seleucus nicator king of
because their dominions lay to the north in respect to jerusalem
and after the end of years they shall be in league together and
the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the
north to make friendship but she shall not obtain the strength of the
arm neither shall her seed stand and she shall be given up and her
young men that brought her and they that strengthened her in these
times
of seleucus
and a plant of the bud of her roots shall stand up and he shall
come with an army and shall enter into the province of the king of the
north and he shall abuse them and shall prevail
and he shall also carry away captive into egypt their gods and
their graven things and their precious vessels of gold and silver he
shall prevail against the king of the north
and the king of the south shall enter into the kingdom and shall
return to his own land
and his sons shall be provoked and they shall assemble a
multitude of great forces and he shall come with haste like a flood
and he shall return and be stirred up and he shall join battle with
his force
and the king of the south being provoked shall go forth and
shall fight against the king of the north and shall prepare an
exceeding great multitude and a multitude shall be given into his
hands
and he shall take a multitude and his heart shall be lifted up
and he shall cast down many thousands but he shall not prevail
for the king of the north shall return and shall prepare a
multitude much greater than before and in the end of times and years
he shall come in haste with a great army and much riches
and in those times many shall rise up against the king of the
south and the children of prevaricators of thy people shall lift up
themselves to fulfil the vision and they shall fall
and the king of the north shall come and shall cast up a mount
and shall take the best fenced cities and the arms of the south shall
not withstand and his chosen ones shall rise up to resist and they
shall not have strength
and he shall come upon him and do according to his pleasure and
there shall be none to stand against his face and he shall stand in the
glorious land and it shall be consumed by his hand
the southibid the glorious land judea
and he shall set his face to come to possess all his kingdom and
he shall make upright conditions with him and he shall give him a
daughter of women to overthrow it and she shall not stand neither
shall she be for him
woman viz his daughter cleopatraibid to overthrow it viz the
kingdom of epiphanes but his policy shall not succeed for cleopatra
shall take more to heart the interest of her husband than that of her
father
and he shall turn his face to the islands and shall take many
and he shall cause the prince of his reproach to cease and his reproach
shall be turned upon him
prince of his reproach because he overthrew antiochus and obliged him
to submit to very dishonourable terms before he would cease from the
war
and he shall turn his face to the empire of his own land and he
shall stumble and fall ans shall not be found
and there shall stand up in his place one most vile and unworthy
of kingly honour and in a few days he shall be destroyed not in rage
nor in battle
temple and was shortly after slain by the same heliodorus
and there shall stand up in his place one despised and the
kingly honour shall not be given him and he shall come privately and
shall obtain the kingdom by fraud
not received for king what is here said of this prince is accommodated
by st jerome and others to antichrist of whom this antiochus was a
figure
and the arms of the fighter shall be overcome before his face
and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenant
fight against himibid the prince of the covenant or of the
league the chief of them that conspired against him or the king of
and after friendships he will deal deceitfully with him and he
shall go up and shall overcome with a small people
and he shall enter into rich and plentiful cities and he shall
do that which his fathers never did nor his fathers fathers he shall
scatter their spoils and their prey and their riches and shall
forecast devices against the best fenced places and this until a time
and his strength and his heart shall be stirred up against the
king of the south with a great army and the king of the south shall be
stirred up to battle with many and very strong succours and they shall
not stand for they shall form designs against him
and they that eat bread with him shall destroy him and his army
shall be overthrown and many shall fall down slain
and the heart of the two kings shall be to do evil and they
shall speak lies at one table and they shall not prosper because as
yet the end is unto another time
and he shall return into his land with much riches and his heart
shall be against the holy covenant and he shall succeed and shall
return into his own land
at the time appointed he shall return and he shall come to the
south but the latter time shall not be like the former
and the galleys and the romans shall come upon him and he shall
be struck and shall return and shall have indignation against
the covenant of the sanctuary and he shall succeed and he shall
return and shall devise against them that have forsaken the covenant
of the sanctuary
who came in galleys and obliged him to depart from egypt
and arms shall stand on his part and they shall defile the
sanctuary of strength and shall take away the continual sacrifice and
they shall place there the abomination unto desolation
temple which is here called the sanctuary of strength from the
and such as deal wickedly against the covenant shall deceitfully
dissemble but the people that know their god shall prevail and succeed
and they that are learned among the people shall teach many and
they shall fall by the sword and by fire and by captivity and by
spoil for many days
and when they shall have fallen they shall be relieved with a
small help and many shall be joined to them deceitfully
and some of the learned shall fall that they may be tried and
may be chosen and made white even to the appointed time because yet
there shall be another time
and the king shall do according to his will and he shall be
lifted up and shall magnify himself against every god and he shall
speak great things against the god of gods and shall prosper till the
wrath be accomplished for the determination is made
and he shall make no account of the god of his fathers and he
shall follow the lust of women and he shall not regard any gods for he
shall rise up against all things
but he shall worship the god maozim in his place and a god whom
his fathers knew not he shall worship with gold and silver and
precious stones and things of great price
and he shall do this to fortify maozim with a strange god whom
he hath acknowledged and he shall increase glory and shall give them
power over many and shall divide the land gratis
lands upon them that shall worship his god
and at the time prefixed the king of the south shall fight
against him and the king of the north shall come against him like a
tempest with chariots and with horsemen and with a great navy and he
shall enter into the countries and shall destroy and pass through
and he shall enter into the glorious land and many shall fall
and these only shall be saved out of his hand edom and moab and the
principality of the children of ammon
and he shall lay his hand upon the lands and the land of egypt
shall not escape
and he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
silver and all the precious things of egypt and he shall pass through
and tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
him and he shall come with a great multitude to destroy and slay many
and he shall fix his tabernacle apadno between the seas upon a
glorious and holy mountain and he shall come even to the top thereof
and none shall help him
to antichrist and the end of the world
but at that time shall michael rise up the great prince who
standeth for the children of thy people and a time shall come such as
never was from the time that nations began even until that time and at
that time shall thy people be saved every one that shall be found
written in the book
and many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
awake some unto life everlasting and others unto reproach to see it
always
but they that are learned shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament and they that instruct many to justice as stars for all
eternity
knowing and loving god
but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to
the time appointed many shall pass over and knowledge shall be
manifold
and i daniel looked and behold as it were two others stood one
on this side upon the bank of the river and another on that side on
the other bank of the river
and i said to the man that was clothed in linen that stood upon
the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these
wonders
and i heard the man that was clothed in linen that stood upon the
waters of the river when he had lifted up his right hand and his left
hand to heaven and had sworn by him that liveth for ever that it
should be unto a time and times and half a time and when the
scattering of the band of the holy people shall be accomplished all
these things shall be finished
and i heard and understood not and i said o my lord what shall
be after these things
and he said go daniel because the words are shut up and sealed
until the appointed time
many shall be chosen and made white and shall be tried as fire
and the wicked shall deal wickedly and none of the wicked shall
understand but the learned shall understand
and from the time when the continual sacrifice shall be taken
away and the abomination unto desolation shall be set up there shall
be a thousand two hundred ninety days
blessed is he that waiteth and cometh unto a thousand three
hundred thirtyfive days
but go thou thy ways until the time appointed and thou shalt
rest and stand in thy lot unto the end of the days
placed in the beginning of the book of daniel till st jerome in his
translation detached it from thence because he did not find it in the
both the one and the other are received by the catholic church and were
from the very beginning a part of the christian bible
now there was a man that dwelt in babylon and his name was
and he took a wife whose name was susanna the daughter of
for her parents being just had instructed their daughter
according to the law of moses
now joakim was very rich and had an orchard near his house and
the jews resorted to him because he was the most honourable of them
all
and there were two of the ancients of the people appointed judges
that year of whom the lord said that iniquity came out from babylon
from the ancient judges that seemed to govern the people
these men frequented the house of joakim and all that hand any
matters of judgment came to them
and when the people departed away at noon susanna went in and
walked in her husbands orchard
and the old men saw her going in every day and walking and they
were inflamed with lust towards her
and they perverted their own mind and turned away their eyes
that they might not look unto heaven nor remember just judgments
so they were both wounded with the love of her yet they did not
make known their grief one to the other
for they were ashamed to declare to one another their lust being
desirous to have to do with her
and they watched carefully every day to see her and one said to
the other
let us now go home for it is dinner time so going out they
departed one from another
and turning back again they came both to the same place and
asking one another the cause they acknowledged their lust and then
they agreed together upon a time when they might find her alone
and it fell out as they watched a fit day she went in on a
time as yesterday and the day before with two maids only and was
desirous to wash herself in the orchard for it was hot weather
and there was nobody there but the two old men that had hid
themselves and were beholding her
so she said to the maids bring me oil and washing balls and
shut the doors of the orchard that i may wash me
and they did as she bade them and they shut the doors of the
orchard and went out by a back door to fetch what she had commanded
them and they knew not that the elders were hid within
now when the maids were gone forth the two elders arose and ran
to her and said
behold the doors of the orchard are shut and nobody seeth us
and we are in love with thee wherefore consent to us and lie with us
but if thou wilt not we will bear witness against thee that a
young man was with thee and therefore thou didst send away thy maids
form thee
susanna sighed and said i am straitened on every side for if i
do this thing it is death to me and if i do it not i shall not escape
your hands
but it is better for me to fall into your hands without doing it
than to sin in the sight of the lord
with that susanna cried out with a loud voice and the elders
also cried out against her
and one of them ran to the door of the orchard and opened it
so when the servants of the house heard the cry in the orchard
they rushed in by the back door to see what was the matter
but after the old men had spoken the servants were greatly
ashamed for never had there been any such word said of susanna and on
the next day
when the people were come to joakim her husband the two elders
also came full of wicked device against susanna to put her to death
and they said before the people send to susanna daughter of
and she came with her parents and children and all her kindred
now susanna was exceeding delicate and beautiful to behold
but those wicked men commanded that her face should be uncovered
for she was covered that so at least they might be satisfied with her
beauty
therefore her friends and all her acquaintance wept
but the two elders rising up in the midst of the people laid
their hands upon her head
and she weeping looked up to heaven for her heart had
confidence in the lord
and the elders said as we walked in the orchard alone this
woman came in with two maids and shut the doors of the orchard ans
sent away the maids from her
then a young man that was there hid came to her and lay with
her
but we that were in a corner of the orchard seeing this
wickedness ran up to them and we saw them lie together
and him indeed we could not take because he was stronger than
us and opening the doors he leaped out
but having taken this woman we asked who the young man was but
she would not tell us of this thing we are witnesses
the multitude believed them as being the elders and the judges
of the people and they condemned her to death
then susanna cried out with a loud voice and said o eternal
to pass
thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me and
behold i must die whereas i have done none of these things which these
men have maliciously forged against me
and the lord heard her voice
and when she was led to be put to death the lord raised up the
holy spirit of a young boy whose name was daniel
and he cried out with a loud voice i am clear from the blood of
this woman
then all the people turning themselves towards him said what
meaneth this word that thou hast spoken
but he standing in the midst of them said are ye so foolish ye
children of israel that without examination or knowledge of the truth
you have condemned a daughter of israel
return to judgment for they have borne false witness against
her
so all the people turned again in haste and the old men said to
him come and sit thou down among us and shew it us seeing god hath
given thee the honour of old age
and daniel said to the people separate these two far from one
another and i will examine them
so when they were put asunder one from the other he called one
of them and said to him o thou that art grown old in evil days now
are thy sins come out which thou hast committed before
in judging unjust judgments oppressing the innocent and letting
the guilty to go free whereas the lord saith the innocent and the just
thou shalt not kill
now then if thou sawest her tell me under what tree thou sawest
them conversing together he said under a mastic tree
and daniel said well hast thou lied against thy own head for
behold the angel of god having received the sentence of him shall cut
thee in two
and having put him aside he commanded that the other should
come and he said to him o thou seed of chanaan and not of juda
beauty hath deceived tee and lust hath perverted thy heart
thus did you do to the daughters of israel and they for fear
conversed with you but a daughter of juda would not abide your
wickedness
now therefore tell me under what tree didst thou take them
conversing together and he answered under a holm tree
and daniel said to him well hast thou also lied against thy own
head for the angel of the lord waiteth with a sword to cut thee in two
and to destroy you
with that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice and they
blessed god who saveth them that trust in him
and they rose up against the two elders for daniel had
convicted them of false witness by their own mouth and they did to them
as they had maliciously dealt against their neighbour
to fulfil the law of moses and they put them to death and
innocent blood was saved in that day
but helcias and his wife praised god for their daughter
was no dishonesty found in her
and daniel became great in the sight of the people from that day
and thence forward
and king astyages was gathered to his fathers and cyrus the
and daniel was the kings guest and was honoured above all his
friends
was evilmerodach the son and successor of nabuchodonosor and a great
favourer of the jews
now the babylonians had an idol called bel and there was spent
upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour and forty sheep
and six vessels of wine
the king also worshipped him and went every day to adore him but
and he answered and said to him because i do not worship idols
made with hands but the living god that created heaven and earth and
hath power over all flesh
and the king said to him doth not bel seem to thee to be a living
god seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day
then daniel smiled and said o king be not deceived for this is
but clay within and brass without neither hath he eaten at any time
and the king being angry called for his priests and said to
them if you tell me not who it is that eateth up these expenses you
shall die
but if you can shew that bel eateth these things daniel shall
die because he hath blasphemed against bel and daniel said to the
king be it done according to thy word
now the priests of bel were seventy beside their wives and
little ones and children and the king went with daniel into the temple
of bel
and the priests of bel said behold we go out and do thou o
king set on the meats and make ready the wine and shut the door fast
and seal it with thy own ring
and when thou comest in the morning if thou findest not that bel
hath eaten up all we will suffer death or else daniel that hath lied
against us
and they little regarded it because they had made under the
table a secret entrance and they always came in by it and consumed
those things
so it came to pass after they were gone out the king set the
meats before bel and daniel commanded his servants and they brought
ashes and he sifted them all over the temple before the king and going
forth they shut the door and having sealed it with the kings ring
they departed
but the priests went in by night according to their custom with
their wives and their children and they eat and drank up all
and the king arose early in the morning and daniel with him
and the king said are the seals whole daniel and he answered
and as soon as he had opened the door the king looked upon the
table and cried out with a loud voice great art thou o bel and there
is not any deceit with thee
and daniel laughed and he held the king that he should not go
in and he said behold the pavement mark whose footsteps these are
and the king said i see the footsteps of men and women and
children and the king was angry
then he took the priests and their wives and their children
and they shewed him the private doors by which they came in and
consumed the things that were on the table
the king therefore put them to death and delivered bel into
the power of daniel who destroyed him and his temple
and there was a great dragon in that place and the babylonians
worshipped him
and the king said to daniel behold thou canst not say now that
this is not a living god adore him therefore
and daniel said i adore the lord my god for he is the living
but give me leave o king and i will kill this dragon without
sword or club and the king said i give thee leave
then daniel took pitch and fat and hair and boiled them
together and he made lumps and put them into the dragons mouth and
the dragon burst asunder and he said behold him whom you worship
and when the babylonians had heard this they took great
indignation and being gathered together against the king they said
dragon and he hath put the priests to death
and they came to the king and said deliver us daniel or else
we will destroy thee and thy house
and the king saw that they pressed upon him violently and being
constrained by necessity he delivered daniel to them
and they cast him into the den of lions and he was there six
days
under darius the mede because he had transgressed the kings edict by
praying three times a day and another time under evilmerodach by a
sedition of the people this time he remained six days in the lions
den the other time only one night
and in the den there were seven lions and they had given to them
two carcasses every day and two sheep but then they were not given
unto them that they might devour daniel
now there was in judea a prophet called habacuc and he had
boiled pottage and had broken bread in a bowl and was going into the
field to carry it to the reapers
lesser prophets but others believe him to be different
and the angel of the lord said to habacuc carry the dinner which
thou hast into babylon to daniel who is in the lions den
and habacuc said lord i never saw babylon nor do i know the
den
and the angel of the lord took him by the top of his head and
carried him by the hair of his head and set him in babylon over the
den in the force of his spirit
and habacuc cried saying o daniel thou servant of god take
the dinner that god hath sent thee
and daniel said thou hast remembered me o god and thou hast
not forsaken them that love thee
and daniel arose and eat and the angel of the lord presently
set habacuc again in his own place
and upon the seventh day the king came to bewail daniel and he
came to the den and looked in and behold daniel was sitting in the
midst of the lions
and the king cried out with a loud voice saying great art thou
but those that had been the cause of his destruction he cast
into the den and they were devoured in a moment before him
then the king said let all the inhabitants of the whole earth
fear the god of daniel for he is the saviour working signs and
wonders in the earth who hath delivered daniel out of the lions den
order of time among those who are commonly called lesser prophets
because their prophecies are short he prophesied in the kingdom of
prophesied in the kingdom of juda
