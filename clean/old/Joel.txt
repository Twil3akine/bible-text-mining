invites them to fasting and prayer

hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the
land did this ever happen in your days or in the days of your fathers
tell ye of this to your children and let your children tell their
children and their children to another generation
that which the palmerworm hath left the locust hath eaten and
that which the locust hath left the bruchus hath eaten and that which
the bruchus hath left the mildew hath destroyed
literally of the desolation of the land by these insects others
understand it of the different invasions of the chaldeans or other
enemies
awake ye that are drunk and weep and mourn all ye that take
delight in drinking sweet wine for it is cut off from your mouth
for a nation come up upon my land strong and without number his
teeth are like the teeth of a lion and his cheek teeth as of a lions
whelp
he hath laid my vineyard waste and hath pilled off the bark of my
fig tree he hath stripped it bare and cast it away the branches
thereof are made white
lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her
youth
sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of the lord the
priests the lords ministers have mourned
the country is destroyed the ground hath mourned for the corn is
wasted the wine is confounded the oil hath languished
the husbandmen are ashamed the vinedressers have howled for the
wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field is perished
the vineyard is confounded and the fig tree hath languished the
pomegranate tree and the palm tree and the apple tree and all the
trees of the field are withered because joy is withdrawn from the
children of men
gird yourselves and lament o ye priests howl ye ministers of
the altars go in lie in sackcloth ye ministers of my god because
sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of your god
sanctify ye a fast call an assembly gather together the
ancients all the inhabitants of the land into the house of your god
and cry ye to the lord
ah ah ah for the day because the day of the lord is at hand
and it shall come like destruction from the mighty
is not your food cut off before your eyes joy and gladness from
the house of our god
the beasts have rotted in their dung the barns are destroyed the
storehouses are broken down because the corn is confounded
why did the beasts groan why did the herds of cattle low
because there is no pasture for them yea and the flocks of sheep are
perished
to thee o lord will i cry because fire hath devoured the
beautiful places of the wilderness and the flame hath burnt all the
trees of the country
yea and the beasts of the field have looked up to thee as a
garden bed that thirsteth after rain for the springs of waters are
dried up and fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the wilderness
blow ye the trumpet in sion sound an alarm in my holy mountain
let all the inhabitants of the land tremble because the day of the lord
cometh because it is nigh at hand
upon sinners
a day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and
whirlwinds a numerous and strong people as the morning spread upon the
mountains the like to it hath not been from the beginning nor shall be
after it even to the years of generation and generation
understand all this of an army of locusts laying waste the land
before the face thereof a devouring fire and behind it a burning
flame the land is like a garden of pleasure before it and behind it a
desolate wilderness neither is there any one that can escape it
the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and they
shall run like horsemen
they shall leap like the noise of chariots upon the tops of
mountains like the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble as a
strong people prepared to battle
at their presence the people shall be in grievous pains all faces
shall be made like a kettle
they shall run like valiant men like men of war they shall scale
the wall the men shall march every one on his way and they shall not
turn aside from their ranks
no one shall press upon his brother they shall walk every one in
his path yea and they shall fall through the windows and shall take
no harm
they shall enter into the city they shall run upon the wall they
shall climb up the houses they shall come in at the windows as a
thief
at their presence the earth hath trembled the heavens are moved
the sun and moon are darkened and the stars have withdrawn their
shining
and the lord hath uttered his voice before the face of his army
for his armies are exceedingly great for they are strong and execute
his word for the day of the lord is great and very terrible and who
can stand it
now therefore saith the lord be converted to me with all your
heart in fasting and in weeping and mourning
and rend your hearts and not your garments and turn to the lord
your god for he is gracious and merciful patient and rich in mercy
and ready to repent of the evil
who knoweth but he will return and forgive and leave a blessing
behind him sacrifice and libation to the lord your god
blow the trumpet in sion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly
gather together the people sanctify the church assemble the
ancients gather together the little ones and them that suck at the
breasts let the bridegroom go forth from his bed and the bride out of
her bridal chamber
between the porch and the altar the priests the lords ministers
shall weep and shall say spare o lord spare thy people and give not
thy inheritance to reproach that the heathens should rule over them why
should they say among the nations where is their god
the lord hath been zealous for his land and hath spared his
people
and the lord answered and said to his people behold i will send
you corn and wine and oil and you shall be filled with them and i
will no more make you a reproach among the nations
and i will remove far off from you the northern enemy and i will
drive him into a land unpassable and desert with his face towards the
east sea and his hinder part towards the utmost sea and his stench
shall ascend and his rottenness shall go up because he hath done
proudly
others of the locusts
fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord hath done
great things
fear not ye beasts of the fields for the beautiful places of the
wilderness are sprung for the tree hath brought forth its fruit the
fig tree and the vine have yielded their strength
and you o children of sion rejoice and be joyful in the lord
your god because he hath given you a teacher of justice and he will
make the early and the latter rain to come down to you as in the
beginning
and the floors shall be filled with wheat and the presses shall
overflow with wine and oil
and i will restore to you the years which the locust and the
bruchus and the mildew and the palmerworm hath eaten my great host
which i sent upon you
and you shall eat in plenty and shall be filled and you shall
praise the name of the lord your god who hath done wonders with you
and my people shall not be confounded for ever
and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel and i am the
confounded forever
and it shall come to pass after this that i will pour out my
spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy
your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions
moreover upon my servants and handmaids in those days i will pour
forth my spirit
and i will shew wonders in heaven and in earth blood and fire
and vapour of smoke
the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood
before the great and dreadful day of the lord doth come
and it shall come to pass that every one that shall call upon the
name of the lord shall be saved for in mount sion and in jerusalem
shall be salvation as the lord hath said and in the residue whom the
for behold in those days and in that time when i shall bring back
the captivity of juda and jerusalem
i will gather together all nations and will bring them down into
the valley of josaphat and i will plead with them there for my people
and for my inheritance israel whom they have scattered among the
nations and have parted my land
and they have cast lots upon my people and the boy they have put
in the stews and the girl they have sold for wine that they might
drink
but what have you to do with me o tyre and sidon and all the
coast of the philistines will you revenge yourselves on me and if you
revenge yourselves on me i will very soon return you a recompense upon
your own head
for you have taken away my silver and my gold and my desirable
and most beautiful things you have carried into your temples
and the children of juda and the children of jerusalem you have
sold to the children of the greeks that you might remove them far off
from their own country
behold i will raise them up out of the place wherein you have sold
them and i will return your recompense upon your own heads
and i will sell your sons and your daughters by the hands of the
children of juda and they shall sell them to the sabeans a nation far
off for the lord hath spoken it
proclaim ye this among the nations prepare war raise up the
strong let them come let all the men of war come up
cut your ploughshares into swords and your spades into spears
break forth and come all ye nations from round about and gather
yourselves together there will the lord cause all thy strong ones to
fall down
let them arise and let the nations come up into the valley of
put ye in the sickles for the harvest is ripe come and go down
for the press is full the fats run over for their wickedness is
multiplied
nations nations in the valley of destruction for the day of the
the sun and the moon are darkened and the stars have withdrawn
their shining
and the lord shall roar out of sion and utter his voice from
shall be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of
and you shall know that i am the lord your god dwelling in sion
my holy mountain and jerusalem shall be holy and strangers shall pass
through it no more
and it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall
drop down sweetness and the hills shall flow with milk and waters
shall flow through all the rivers of juda and a fountain shall come
forth of the house of the lord and shall water the torrent of thorns
fountain of grace in the church militant and of glory in the church
triumphant which shall water the torrent or valley of thorns that is
the souls that before like barren ground brought forth nothing but
thorns or that were afflicted with the thorns of crosses and
tribulations
egypt shall be a desolation and edom a wilderness destroyed
because they have done unjustly against the children of juda and have
shed innocent blood in their land
and judea shall be inhabited for ever and jerusalem to generation
and generation
church of christ
and i will cleanse their blood which i had not cleansed and the
from following the cattle to denounce gods judgments to the people of
which they continued without repentance
