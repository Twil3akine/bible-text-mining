there was a man in the land of hus whose name was job and that
man was simple and upright and fearing god and avoiding evil
and there were born to him seven sons and three daughters
and his possession was seven thousand sheep and three thousand
camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred sheasses and a
family exceedingly great and this man was great among all the people of
the east
and his sons went and made a feast by houses every one in his
day and sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with
them
house and had his day inviting the others and their sisters
and when the days of their feasting were gone about job sent to
them and sanctified them and rising up early offered holocausts for
every one of them for he said lest perhaps my sons have sinned and
have blessed god in their hearts so did job all days
scripture both here and ver and in the following chapter ver
and uses the word bless to signify its contrary
now on a certain day when the sons of god came to stand before the
represents to us in a figure accommodated to the ways and
understandings of men the restless endeavours of satan against the
servants of god that he can do nothing without gods permission
assists them by his divine grace in such manner that the vain efforts
of the enemy only serve to illustrate their virtue and increase their
merit
and the lord said to him whence comest thou and he answered and
said i have gone round about the earth and walked through it
and the lord said to him hast thou considered my servant job
that there is none like him in the earth a simple and upright man and
fearing god and avoiding evil
and satan answering said doth job fear god in vain
hast thou not made a fence for him and his house and all his
substance round about blessed the works of his hands and his
possession hath increased on the earth
but stretch forth thy hand a little and touch all that he hath
and see if he bless thee not to thy face
then the lord said to satan behold all that he hath is in thy
hand only put not forth thy hand upon his person and satan went forth
from the presence of the lord
now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating
and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother
there came a messenger to job and said the oxen were ploughing
and the asses feeding beside them
and the sabeans rushed in and took all away and slew the
servants with the sword and i alone have escaped to tell thee
and while he was yet speaking another came and said the fire of
consumed them and i alone have escaped to tell thee
and while he also was yet speaking there came another and said
taken them moreover they have slain the servants with the sword and i
alone have escaped to tell thee
he was yet speaking and behold another came in and said thy
sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their
eldest brother
a violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert and
shook the four corners of the house and it fell upon thy children and
they are dead and i alone have escaped to tell thee
then job rose up and rent his garments and having shaven his
head fell down upon the ground and worshipped
and said naked came i out of my mothers womb and naked shall i
return thither the lord gave and the lord hath taken away as it hath
pleased the lord so is it done blessed be the name of the lord
in all these things job sinned not by his lips nor spoke he any
foolish thing against god
and it came to pass when on a certain day the sons of god came
and stood before the lord and satan came amongst them and stood in his
sight
that the lord said to satan whence comest thou and he answered
and said i have gone round about the earth and walked through it
and the lord said to satan hast thou considered my servant job
that there is none like him in the earth a man simple and upright and
fearing god and avoiding evil and still keeping his innocence but
thou hast moved me against him that i should afflict him without cause
and satan answered and said skin for skin and all that a man
hath he will give for his life
but put forth thy hand and touch his bone and his flesh and then
thou shalt see that he will bless thee to thy face
and the lord said to satan behold he is in thy hand but yet save
his life
so satan went forth from the presence of the lord and struck job
with a very grievous ulcer from the sole of the foot even to the top of
his head
and he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter sitting on a
dunghill
and his wife said to him dost thou still continue in thy
simplicity bless god and die
and he said to her thou hast spoken like one of the foolish
women if we have received good things at the hand of god why should we
not receive evil in all these things job did not sin with his lips
now when jobs three friends heard all the evil that had befallen
him they came every one from his own place eliphaz the themanite and
appointment to come together and visit him and comfort him
and when they had lifted up their eyes afar off they knew him
not and crying out they wept and rending their garments they
sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven
and they sat with him on the ground seven day and seven nights and
no man spoke to him a word for they saw that his grief was very great
after this job opened his mouth and cursed his day
evil to any thing of gods creation but only to express in a stronger
manner his sense of human miseries in general and of his own calamities
in particular
and he said
let the day perish wherein i was born and the night in which it
was said a man child is conceived
let that day be turned into darkness let not god regard it from
above and let not the light shine upon it
let darkness and the shadow of death cover it let a mist
overspread it and let it be wrapped up in bitterness
let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night let it not be
counted in the days of the year nor numbered in the months
let that night be solitary and not worthy of praise
let them curse it who curse the day who are ready to raise up a
leviathan
let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof let it expect
light and not see it nor the rising of the dawning of the day
because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me nor
took away evils from my eyes
why did i not die in the womb why did i not perish when i came
out of the belly
why received upon the knees why suckled at the breasts
for now i should have been asleep and still and should have rest
in my sleep
with kings and consuls of the earth who build themselves
solitudes
or with princes that possess gold and fill their houses with
silver
or as a hidden untimely birth i should not be or as they that
being conceived have not seen the light
there the wicked cease from tumult and there the wearied in
strength are at rest
and they sometime bound together without disquiet have not heard
the voice of the oppressor
the small and great are there and the servant is free from his
master
why is light given to him that is in misery and life to them that
are in bitterness of soul
that look for death and it cometh not as they that dig for a
treasure
and they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave
to a man whose way is hidden and god hath surrounded him with
darkness
before i eat i sigh and as overflowing waters so is my roaring
for the fear which i feared hath come upon me and that which i
was afraid of hath befallen me
have i not dissembled have i not kept silence have i not been
quiet and indignation is come upon me
then eliphaz the themanite answered and said
if we begin to speak to thee perhaps thou wilt take it ill but
who can withhold the words he hath conceived
behold thou hast taught many and thou hast strengthened the weary
hands
thy words have confirmed them that were staggering and thou hast
strengthened the trembling knees
but now the scourge is come upon thee and thou faintest it hath
touched thee and thou art troubled
where is thy fear thy fortitude thy patience and the perfection
of thy ways
remember i pray thee who ever perished being innocent or when
were the just destroyed
on the contrary i have seen those who work iniquity and sow
sorrows and reap them
perishing by the blast of god and consumed by the spirit of his
wrath
the roaring of the lion and the voice of the lioness and the
teeth of the whelps of lions are broken
the tiger hath perished for want of prey and the young lions are
scattered abroad
now there was a word spoken to me in private and my ears by
stealth as it were received the veins of its whisper
in the horror of a vision by night when deep sleep is wont to
hold men
fear seized upon me and trembling and all my bones were
affrighted
and when a spirit passed before me the hair of my flesh stood up
there stood one whose countenance i knew not an image before my
eyes and i heard the voice as it were of a gentle wind
shall man be justified in comparison of god or shall a man be
more pure than his maker
which eliphaz had heard from an angel which ver he calls a
spirit
behold they that serve him are not steadfast and in his angels
he found wickedness
how much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay who have an
earthly foundation be consumed as with the moth
from morning till evening they shall be cut down and because no
one understandeth they shall perish for ever
and they that shall be left shall be taken away from them they
shall die and not in wisdom
call now if there be any that will answer thee and turn to some
of the saints
anger indeed killeth the foolish and envy slayeth the little one
i have seen a fool with a strong root and i cursed his beauty
immediately
his children shall be far from safety and shall be destroyed in
the gate and there shall be none to deliver them
whose harvest the hungry shall eat and the armed man shall take
him by violence and the thirsty shall drink up his riches
nothing upon earth is done without a cause and sorrow doth not
spring out of the ground
man is born to labour and the bird to fly
wherefore i will pray to the lord and address my speech to god
who doth great things and unsearchable and wonderful things
without number
who giveth rain upon the face of the earth and watereth all
things with waters
who setteth up the humble on high and comforteth with health
those that mourn
who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant so that their
hands cannot accomplish what they had begun
who catcheth the wise in their craftiness and disappointeth the
counsel of the wicked
they shall meet with darkness in the day and grope at noonday as
in the night
but he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth and the
poor from the hand of the violent
and to the needy there shall be hope but iniquity shall draw in
her mouth
blessed is the man whom god correcteth refuse not therefore the
chastising of the lord
for he woundeth and cureth he striketh and his hands shall
heal
in six troubles he shall deliver thee and in the seventh evil
shall not touch thee
in famine he shall deliver thee from death and in battle from
the hand of the sword
thou shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue and thou
shalt not fear calamity when it cometh
in destruction and famine thou shalt laugh and thou shalt not be
afraid of the beasts of the earth
but thou shalt have a covenant with the stones of the lands and
the beasts of the earth shall be at peace with thee
and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle is in peace and visiting
thy beauty thou shalt not sin
thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be multiplied and thy
offspring like the grass of the earth
thou shalt enter into the grave in abundance as a heap of wheat
is brought in its season
behold this is even so as we have searched out which thou
having heard consider it thoroughly in thy mind
but job answered and said
o that my sins whereby i have deserved wrath and the calamity
that i suffer were weighed in a balance
sins but with the imaginary crimes which his friends imputed to him
and especially with his wrath or grief expressed in the third chapter
which they so much accused though as he tells them here it bore no
proportion with the greatness of his calamity
as the sand of the sea this would appear heavier therefore my
words are full of sorrow
for the arrows of the lord are in me the rage whereof drinketh up
my spirit and the terrors of the lord war against me
will the wild ass bray when he hath grass or will the ox low when
he standeth before a full manger
or can an unsavoury thing be eaten that is not seasoned with salt
or can a man taste that which when tasted bringeth death
the things which before my soul would not touch now through
anguish are my meats
who will grant that my request may come and that god may give me
what i look for
and that he that hath begun may destroy me that he may let loose
his hand and cut me off
and that this may be my comfort that afflicting me with sorrow
he spare not nor i contradict the words of the holy one
for what is my strength that i can hold out or what is my end
that i should keep patience
my strength is not the strength of stones nor is my flesh of
brass
behold there is no help for me in myself and my familiar friends
also are departed from me
he that taketh away mercy from his friend forsaketh the fear of
the lord
my brethren have passed by me as the torrent that passeth swiftly
in the valleys
they that fear the hoary frost the snow shall fall upon them
at the time when they shall be scattered they shall perish and
after it groweth hot they shall be melted out of their place
the paths of their steps are entangled they shall walk in vain
and shall perish
consider the paths of thema the ways of saba and wait a little
while
they arc confounded because i have hoped they are come also even
unto me and are covered with shame
now you are come and now seeing my affliction you are afraid
did i say bring to me and give me of your substance
or deliver me from the hand of the enemy and rescue me out of the
hand of the mighty
teach me and i will hold my peace and if i have been ignorant of
any thing instruct me
why have you detracted the words of truth whereas there is none
of you that can reprove me
you dress up speeches only to rebuke and you utter words to the
wind
you rush in upon the fatherless and you endeavour to overthrow
your friend
however finish what you have begun give ear and see whether i
lie
answer i beseech you without contention and speaking that which
is just judge ye
and you shall not find iniquity in my tongue neither shall folly
sound in my mouth
the life of man upon earth is a warfare and his days are like the
days of a hireling
as a servant longeth for the shade as the hireling looketh for the
end of his work
so i also have had empty months and have numbered to myself
wearisome nights
if i lie down to sleep i shall say when shall i rise and again
darkness
my flesh is clothed with rottenness and the filth of dust my skin
is withered and drawn together
my days have passed more swiftly than the web is cut by the weaver
and are consumed without any hope
remember that my life is but wind and my eye shall not return to
see good things
nor shall the sight of man behold me thy eyes are upon me and i
shall be no more
as a cloud is consumed and passeth away so he that shall go down
to hell shall not come up
nor shall he return any more into his house neither shall his
place know him any more
wherefore i will not spare my month i will speak in the
affliction of my spirit i will talk with the bitterness of my soul
am i a sea or a whale that thou hast inclosed me in a prison
if i say my bed shall comfort me and i shall be relieved
speaking with myself on my couch
thou wilt frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions
so that my soul rather chooseth hanging and my bones death
i have done with hope i shall now live no longer spare me for
my days are nothing
what is a man that thou shouldst magnify him or why dost thou set
thy heart upon him
thou visitest him early in the morning and thou provest him
suddenly
how long wilt thou not spare me nor suffer me to swallow down my
spittle
i have sinned what shall i do to thee o keeper of men why hast
thou set me opposite to thee and am i become burdensome to myself
why dost thou not remove my sin and why dost thou not take away
my iniquity behold now i shall sleep in the dust and if thou seek me
in the morning i shall not be
then baldad the suhite answered and said
how long wilt thou speak these things and how long shall the words
of thy mouth be like a strong wind
doth god pervert judgment or doth the almighty overthrow that
which is just
although thy children have sinned against him and he hath left
them in the hand of their iniquity
yet if thou wilt arise early to god and wilt beseech the almighty
if thou wilt walk clean and upright he will presently awake unto
thee and will make the dwelling of thy justice peaceable
in so much that if thy former things were small thy latter things
would be multiplied exceedingly
for inquire of the former generation and search diligently into
the memory of the fathers
for we are but of yesterday and are ignorant that our days upon
earth are but a shadow
and they shall teach thee they shall speak to thee and utter
words out of their hearts
can the rush be green without moisture or sedge bush grow without
water
when it is yet in flower and is not plucked u with the hand it
withereth before all herbs
even so are the ways of all that forget god an the hope of the
hypocrite shall perish
his folly shall not please him and his trust shall be like the
spiders web
he shall lean upon his house and it shall no stand he shall prop
it up and it shall not rise
he seemeth to have moisture before the sun cometh and at his
rising his blossom shall shoot forth
his roots shall be thick upon a heap of stones and among the
stones he shall abide
if one swallow him up out of his place he shall deny him and
shall say i know thee not
for this is the joy of his way that others may spring again out
of the earth
god will not cast away the simple nor reach out his hand to the
evil doer
until thy mouth be filled with laughter and thy lips with
rejoicing
they that hate thee shall be clothed with confusion and the
dwelling of the wicked shall not stand
and job answered and said
indeed i know it is so and that man cannot be justified compared
with god
if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one for a
thousand
he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath resisted him
and hath had peace
who hath removed mountains and they whom he overthrew in his
wrath knew it not
who shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof
tremble
who commandeth the sun and it riseth not and shutteth up the
stars as it were under a seal
who alone spreadeth out the heavens and walketh upon the waves of
the sea
who maketh arcturus and orion and hyades and the inner parts of
the south
who doth things great and incomprehensible and wonderful of
which there is no number
if he come to me i shall not see him if he depart i shall not
understand
if he examine on a sudden who shall answer him or who can say
god whose wrath no man can resist and under whom they stoop that
bear up the world
what am i then that i should answer him and have words with him
i who although i should have any just thing would not answer
but would make supplication to my judge
and if he should hear me when i call i should not believe that he
had heard my voice
for he shall crush me in a whirlwind and multiply my wounds even
without cause
crime of mine
he alloweth not my spirit to rest and he filleth me with
bitterness
if strength be demanded he is most strong if equity of judgment
no man dare bear witness for me
if i would justify myself my own mouth shall condemn me if i
would shew myself innocent he shall prove me wicked
although i should be simple even this my soul shall be ignorant
of and i shall be weary of my life
one thing there is that i have spoken both the innocent and the
wicked he consumeth
if he scourge let him kill at once and not laugh at the pains of
the innocent
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the
face of the judges thereof and if it be not he who is it then
my days have been swifter than a post they have fled away and
have not seen good
they have passed by as ships carrying fruits as an eagle flying
to the prey
if i say i will not speak so i change my face and am tormented
with sorrow
i feared all my works knowing that thou didst not spare the
offender
but if so also i am wicked why have i laboured in vain
if i be washed as it were with snow waters and my hands shall
shine ever so clean
yet thou shalt plunge me in filth and my garments shall abhor me
for i shall not answer a man that is like myself nor one that may
be heard with me equally in judgment
there is none that may be able to reprove both and to put his
hand between both
let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify
me
i will speak and will not fear him for i cannot answer while i
am in fear
my soul is weary of my life i will let go my speech against
myself i will speak in the bitterness of my soul
i will say to god do not condemn me tell me why thou judgest me
so
doth it seem good to thee that thou shouldst calumniate me and
oppress me the work of thy own hands and help the counsel of the
wicked
hast thou eyes of flesh or shalt thou see as man seeth
are thy days as the days of man and are thy years as the times of
men
that thou shouldst inquire after my iniquity and search after my
sin
and shouldst know that i have done no wicked thing whereas there
is no man that can deliver out of thy hand
thy hands have made me and fashioned me wholly round about and
dost thou thus cast me down headlong on a sudden
remember i beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay and
thou wilt bring me into dust
hast thou not milked me as milk and curdled me like cheese
thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh thou hast put me
together with bones and sinews
thou hast granted me life and mercy and thy visitation hath
preserved my spirit
although thou conceal these things in thy heart yet i know that
thou rememberest all things
if i have sinned and thou hast spared me for an hour why dost
thou not suffer me to be clean from my iniquity
and if i be wicked woe unto me and if just i shall not lift up
my head being filled with affliction and misery
and for pride thou wilt take me as a lioness and returning thou
tormentest me wonderfully
thou renewest thy witnesses against me and multipliest thy wrath
upon me and pains war against me
why didst thou bring me forth out of the womb o that i had been
consumed that eye might not see me
i should have been as if i had not been carried from the womb to
the grave
shall not the fewness of my days be ended shortly suffer me
therefore that i may lament my sorrow a little
before i go and return no more to a land that is dark and
covered with the mist of death
a land of misery and darkness where the shadow of death and no
order but everlasting horror dwelleth
repentance
then sophar the naamathite answered and said
shall not he that speaketh much hear also or shall a man full of
talk be justified
shall men hold their peace to thee only and when thou hast mocked
others shall no man confute thee
for thou hast said my word is pure and i am clean in thy sight
and i wish that god would speak with thee and would open his lips
to thee
that he might shew thee the secrets of wisdom and that his law is
manifold and thou mightest understand that he exacteth much less of
thee than thy iniquity deserveth
peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of god and wilt find
out the almighty perfectly
he is higher than heaven and what wilt thou do he is deeper than
hell and how wilt thou know
the measure of him is longer than the earth and broader than the
sea
if he shall overturn all things or shall press them together
who shall contradict him
for he knoweth the vanity of men and when he seeth iniquity
doth he not consider it
a vain man is lifted up into pride and thinketh himself born
free like a wild asss colt
but thou hast hardened thy heart and hast spread thy hands to
him
if thou wilt put away from thee the iniquity that is in thy hand
and let not injustice remain in thy tabernacle
then mayst thou lift up thy face without spot and thou shalt be
steadfast and shalt not fear
thou shalt also forget misery and remember it only as waters
that are passed away
and brightness like that of the noonday shall arise to thee at
evening and when thou shalt think thyself consumed thou shalt rise as
the day star
and thou shalt have confidence hope being set before thee and
being buried thou shalt sleep secure
thou shalt rest and there shall be none to make thee afraid and
many shall entreat thy face
but the eyes of the wicked shall decay and the way to escape
shall fail them and their hope the abomination of the soul
then job answered and said
are you then men alone and shall wisdom die with you
i also have a heart as well as you for who is ignorant of these
things which you know
he that is mocked by his friends as i shall call upon god and he
will hear him for the simplicity of the just man is laughed to scorn
the lamp despised in the thoughts of the rich is ready for the
time appointed
the tabernacles of robbers abound and they provoke god boldly
whereas it is he that hath given all into their hands
but ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the birds
of the air and they shall tell thee
speak to the earth and it shall answer thee and the fishes of
the sea shall tell
who is ignorant that the hand of the lord hath made all these
things
in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the spirit
of all flesh of man
doth not the ear discern words and the palate of him that
eateth the taste
in the ancient is wisdom and in length of days prudence
with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and
understanding
if he pull down there is no man that can build up if he shut up
a man there is none that can open
if he withhold the waters all things shall be dried up and if
he send them out they shall overturn the earth
with him is strength and wisdom he knoweth both the deceivers
and him that is deceived
he bringeth counsellors to a foolish end and judges to
insensibility
he looseth the belt of kings and girdeth their loins with a
cord
he leadeth away priests without glory and overthroweth nobles
he changeth the speech of the true speakers and taketh away the
doctrine of the aged
he poureth contempt upon princes and relieveth them that were
oppressed
he discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth up to
light the shadow of death
he multiplieth nations and destroyeth them and restoreth them
again after they were overthrown
he changeth the heart of the princes of the people of the earth
and deceiveth them that they walk in vain where there is no way
they shall grope as in the dark and not in the light and he
shall make them stagger like men that are drunk
behold my eye hath seen all these things and my ear hath heard
them and i have understood them all
according to your knowledge i also know neither am i inferior to
you
but yet i will speak to the almighty and i desire to reason with
having first shewn that you are forgers of lies and maintainers
of perverse opinions
and i wish you would hold your peace that you might be thought to
be wise men
hear ye therefore my reproof and attend to the judgment of my
lips
hath god any need of your lie that you should speak deceitfully
for him
do you accept this person and do you endeavour to judge for god
or shall it please him from whom nothing can be concealed or
shall he be deceived as a man with your deceitful dealings
he shall reprove you because in secret you accept his person
as soon as he shall move himself he shall trouble you and his
dread shall fall upon you
your remembrance shall be compared to ashes and your necks shall
be brought to clay
hold your peace a little while that i may speak whatsoever my
mind shall suggest to me
why do i tear my flesh with my teeth and carry my soul in my
hands
although he should kill me i will trust in him but yet i will
reprove my ways in his sight
and he shall be my saviour for no hypocrite shall come before
his presence
hear ye my speech and receive with your ears hidden truths
if i shall be judged i know that i shall be found just
who is he that will plead against me let him come why am i
consumed holding my peace
two things only do not to me and then from thy face i shall not
be hid
withdraw thy hand far from me and let not thy dread terrify me
call me and i will answer thee or else i will speak and do
thou answer me
how many are my iniquities and sins make me know my crimes and
offenses
why hidest thou thy face and thinkest me thy enemy
against a leaf that is carried away with the wind thou shewest
thy power and thou pursuest a dry straw
for thou writest bitter things against me and wilt consume me
for the sins of my youth
thou hast put my feet in the stocks and hast observed all my
paths and hast considered the steps of my feet
who am to be consumed as rottenness and as a garment that is
motheaten
resurrection
man born of a woman living for a short time is filled with many
miseries
who cometh forth like a flower and is destroyed and fleeth as a
shadow and never continueth in the same state
and dost thou think it meet to open thy eyes upon such an one and
to bring him into judgment with thee
who can make him clean that is conceived of unclean seed is it
not thou who only art
the days of man are short and the number of his months is with
thee thou hast appointed his bounds which cannot be passed
depart a little from him that he may rest until his wished for
day come as that of the hireling
a tree hath hope if it be cut it growth green again and the
boughs thereof sprout
if its roots be old in the earth and its stock be dead in the
dust
at the scent of water it shall spring and bring forth leaves as
when it was first planted
but man when he shall be dead and stripped and consumed i pray
you where is he
as if the waters should depart out of the sea and an emptied
river should be dried up
so man when he is fallen asleep shall not rise again till the
heavens be broken he shall not awake nor rise up out of his sleep
who will grant me this that thou mayst protect me in hell and
hide me till thy wrath pass and appoint me a time when thou wilt
remember me
and in the place where the souls are kept waiting for their redeemer
shall man that is dead thinkest thou live again all the days
in which i am now in warfare i expect until my change come
thou shalt call me and i will answer thee to the work of thy
hands thou shalt reach out thy right hand
thou indeed hast numbered my steps but spare my sins
thou hast sealed up my offences as it were in a bag but hast
cured my iniquity
a mountain falling cometh to nought and a rock is removed out of
its place
waters wear away the stones and with inundation the ground by
little and little is washed away so in like manner thou shalt destroy
man
thou hast strengthened him for a little while that he may pass
away for ever thou shalt change his face and shalt send him away
whether his children come to honour or dishonour he shall not
understand
but yet his flesh while he shall live shall have pain and his
soul shall mourn over him
state of the wicked
and eliphaz the themanite answered and said
will a wise man answer as if he were speaking in the wind and
fill his stomach with burning heat
thou reprovest him by words who is not equal to thee and thou
speakest that which is not good for thee
as much as is in thee thou hast made void fear and hast taken
away prayers from before god
for thy iniquity hath taught thy mouth and thou imitatest the
tongue of blasphemers
thy own mouth shall condemn thee and not i and thy own lips
shall answer thee
art thou the first man that was born or wast thou made before the
hills
hast thou heard gods counsel and shall his wisdom be inferior to
thee
what knowest thou that we are ignorant of what dost thou
understand that we know not
there are with us also aged and ancient men much elder than thy
fathers
is it a great matter that god should comfort thee but thy wicked
words hinder this
why doth thy heart elevate thee and why dost thou stare with thy
eyes as if they were thinking great things
why doth thy spirit swell against god to utter such words out of
thy mouth
what is man that he should be without spot and he that is born
of a woman that he should appear just
behold among his saints none is unchangeable and the heavens are
not pure in his sight
how much more is man abominable and unprofitable who drinketh
iniquity like water
i will shew thee hear me and i will tell thee what i have seen
wise men confess and hide not their fathers
and documents they have received from their fathers they are not ashamed
to own
to whom alone the earth was given and no stranger hath passed
among them
the wicked man is proud all his days and the number of the years
of his tyranny is uncertain
the sound of dread is always in his ears and when there is
peace he always suspecteth treason
he believeth not that he may return from darkness to light
looking round about for the sword on every side
when he moveth himself to seek bread he knoweth that the day of
darkness is ready at his hand
tribulation shall terrify him and distress shall surround him
as a king that is prepared for the battle
for he hath stretched out his hand against god and hath
strengthened himself against the almighty
he hath run against him with his neck raised up and is armed
with a fat neck
fatness hath covered his face and the fat hangeth down on his
sides
he hath dwelt in desolate cities and in desert houses that are
reduced into heaps
he shall not be enriched neither shall his substance continue
neither shall he push his root in the earth
he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his
branches and he shall be taken away by the breath of his own mouth
he shall not believe being vainly deceived by error that he may
be redeemed with any price
before his days be full he shall perish and his hands shall
wither away
he shall be blasted as a vine when its grapes are in the first
flower and as an olive tree that casteth its flower
for the congregation of the hypocrite is barren and fire shall
devour their tabernacles who love to take bribes
he hath conceived sorrow and hath brought forth iniquity and
his womb prepareth deceits
then job answered and said
i have often heard such things as these you are all troublesome
comforters
shall windy words have no end or is it any trouble to thee to
speak
i also could speak like you and would god your soul were for my
soul
i would comfort you also with words and would wag my head over
you
i would strengthen you with my mouth and would move my lips as
sparing you
but what shall i do if i speak my pain will not rest and if i
hold my peace it will not depart from me
but now my sorrow hath oppressed me and all my limbs are brought
to nothing
my wrinkles bear witness against me and a false speaker riseth up
against my face contradicting me
he hath gathered together his fury against me and threatening me
he hath gnashed with his teeth upon me my enemy hath beheld me with
terrible eyes
they have opened their mouths upon me and reproaching me they
have struck me on the cheek they are filled with my pains
god hath shut me up with the unjust man and hath delivered me
into the hands of the wicked
i that was formerly so wealthy am all on a sudden broken to
pieces he hath taken me by my neck he hath broken me and hath set me
up to be his mark
he hath compassed me round about with his lances he hath wounded
my loins he hath not spared and hath poured out my bowels on the
earth
he hath torn me with wound upon wound he hath rushed in upon me
like a giant
i have sowed sackcloth upon my skin and have covered my flesh
with ashes
my face is swollen with weeping and my eyelids are dim
these things have i suffered without the iniquity of my hand
when i offered pure prayers to god
o earth cover not thou my blood neither let my cry find a
hiding place in thee
for behold my witness is in heaven and he that knoweth my
conscience is on high
my friends are full of words my eye poureth out tears to god
and o that a man might so be judged with god as the son of man
is judged with his companion
for behold short years pass away and i am walking in a path by
which i shall not return
my spirit shall be wasted my days shall be shortened and only the
grave remaineth for me
i have not sinned and my eye abideth in bitterness
with
deliver me o lord and set me beside thee and let any mans hand
fight against me
thou hast set their heart far from understanding therefore they
shall not be exalted
he promiseth a prey to his companions and the eyes of his
children shall fail
he hath made me as it were a byword of the people and i am an
example before them
my eye is dim through indignation and my limbs are brought as it
were to nothing
the just shall be astonished at this and the innocent shall be
raised up against the hypocrite
and the just man shall hold on his way and he that hath clean
hands shall be stronger and stronger
wherefore be you all converted and come and i shall not find
among you any wise man
my days have passed away my thoughts are dissipated tormenting
my heart
they have turned night into day and after darkness i hope for
light again
if i wait hell is my house and i have made my bed in darkness
i have said to rottenness thou art my father to worms my
mother and my sister
where is now then my expectation and who considereth my
patience
all that i have shall go down into the deepest pit thinkest thou
that there at least i shall have rest
then baldad the suhite answered and said
how long will you throw out words understand first and so let us
speak
why are we reputed as beasts and counted vile before you
thou that destroyest thy soul in thy fury shall the earth be
forsaken for thee and shall rocks be removed out of their place
shall not the light of the wicked be extinguished and the flame
of his fire not shine
the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and the lamp that is
over him shall be put out
the step of his strength shall be straitened and his own counsel
shall cast him down headlong
for he hath thrust his feet into a net and walketh in its meshes
the sole of his foot shall be held in a snare and thirst shall
burn against him
a gin is hidden for him in the earth and his trap upon the path
fears shall terrify him on every side and shall entangle his
feet
let his strength be wasted with famine and let hunger invade his
ribs
let it devour the beauty of his skin let the firstborn death
consume his arms
let his confidence be rooted out of his tabernacle and let
destruction tread upon him like a king
let the companions of him that is not dwell in his tabernacle
let brimstone be sprinkled in his tent
let his roots be dried up beneath and his harvest destroyed
above
let the memory of him perish from the earth and let not his name
be renowned in the streets
he shall drive him out of light into darkness and shall remove
him out of the world
his seed shall not subsist nor his offspring among his people
nor any remnants in his country
they that come after him shall be astonished at his day and
horror shall fall upon them that went before
these then are the tabernacles of the wicked and this the place
of him that knoweth not god
sufferings and his belief of a future resurrection
then job answered and said
how long do you afflict my soul and break me in pieces with
words
behold these ten times you confound me and are not ashamed to
oppress me
for if i have been ignorant my ignorance shall be with me
but you set yourselves up against me and reprove me with my
reproaches
at least now understand that god hath not afflicted me with an
equal judgment and compassed me with his scourges
being a just man and truly considering his own life thought that his
affliction was greater than his sins deserved and in that respect that
the punishment was not equal yet it was just as coming from god who
gives a crown of justice to those who suffer for righteousness sake
and proves the just with tribulations as gold is tried by fire
behold i shall cry suffering violence and no one will hear i
shall cry aloud and there is none to judge
he hath hedged in my path round about and i cannot pass and in
my way he hath set darkness
he hath stripped me of my glory and hath taken the crown from my
head
he hath destroyed me on every side and i am lost and he hath
taken away my hope as from a tree that is plucked up
his wrath is kindled against me and he hath counted me as his
enemy
his troops have come together and have made themselves a way by
me and have besieged my tabernacle round about
he hath put my brethren far from me and my acquaintance like
strangers have departed from me
my kinsmen have forsaken me and they that knew me have
forgotten me
they that dwell in my house and my maidservants have counted me
as a stranger and i have been like an alien in their eyes
i called my servant and he gave me no answer i entreated him
with my own mouth
my wife hath abhorred my breath and i entreated the children of
my womb
even fools despised me and when i was gone from them they spoke
against me
they that were sometime my counsellors have abhorred me and he
whom i loved most is turned against me
the flesh being consumed my bone hath cleaved to my skin and
nothing but lips are left about my teeth
have pity on me have pity on me at least you my friends
because the hand of the lord hath touched me
why do you persecute me as god and glut yourselves with my
flesh
who will grant me that my words may be written who will grant me
that they may be marked down in a book
with an iron pen and in a plate of lead or else be graven with
an instrument in flint stone
for i know that my redeemer liveth and in the last day i shall
rise out of the earth
of the resurrection of the flesh not as one tree riseth in place of
another but that the selfsame flesh shall rise at the last day by the
power of god changed in quality but not in substance every one to
receive sentence according to his works in this life
and i shall be clothed again with my skin and in my flesh i
shall see my god
whom i myself shall see and my eyes shall behold and not
another this my hope is laid up in my bosom
why then do you say now let us persecute him and let us find
occasion of word against him
flee then from the face of the sword for the sword is the
revenger of iniquities and know ye that there is a judgment
sudden downfall
then sophar the naamathite answered and said
therefore various thoughts succeed one another in me and my mind
is hurried away to different things
the doctrine with which thou reprovest me i will hear and the
spirit of my understanding shall answer for me
this i know from the beginning since man was placed upon the
earth
that the praise of the wicked is short and the joy of the
hypocrite but for a moment
if his pride mount up even to heaven and his head touch the
clouds
in the end he shall be destroyed like a dunghill and they that
had seen him shall say where is he
as a dream that fleeth away he shall not be found he shall pass
as a vision of the night
the eyes that had seen him shall see him no more neither shall
his place any more behold him
his children shall be oppressed with want and his hands shall
render to him his sorrow
his bones shall be filled with the vices of his youth and they
shall sleep with him in the dust
for when evil shall be sweet in his mouth he will hide it under
his tongue
he will spare it and not leave it and will hide it in his
throat
his bread in his belly shall be turned into the gall of asps
within him
the riches which he hath swallowed he shall vomit up and god
shall draw them out of his belly
he shall suck the head of asps and the vipers tongue shall kill
him
let him not see the streams of the river the brooks of honey and
of butter
he shall be punished for all that he did and yet shall not be
consumed according to the multitude of his devices so also shall he
suffer
gratify his passions and to oppress and destroy the poor
because he broke in and stripped the poor he hath violently
taken away a house which he did not build
and yet his belly was not filled and when he hath the things he
coveted he shall not be able to possess them
there was nothing left of his meat and therefore nothing shall
continue of his goods
when he shall be filled he shall be straitened he shall burn
and every sorrow shall fall upon him
may his belly be filled that god may send forth the wrath of his
indignation upon him and rain down his war upon him
he shall flee from weapons of iron and shall fall upon a bow of
brass
the sword is drawn out and cometh forth from its scabbard and
glittereth in his bitterness the terrible ones shall go and come upon
him
all darkness is hid in his secret places a fire that is not
kindled shall devour him he shall be afflicted when left in his
tabernacle
the heavens shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise
up against him
the offspring of his house shall be exposed he shall be pulled
down in the day of gods wrath
this is the portion of a wicked man from god and the inheritance
of his doings from the lord
of their life but that their judgment is in another world
then job answered and said
hear i beseech you my words and do penance
suffer me and i will speak and after if you please laugh at my
words
is my debate against man that i should not have just reason to be
troubled
hearken to me and be astonished and lay your finger on your
mouth
as for me when i remember i am afraid and trembling taketh hold
on my flesh
why then do the wicked live are they advanced and strengthened
with riches
their seed continueth before them a multitude of kinsmen and of
childrens children in their sight
their houses are secure and peaceable and the rod of god is not
upon them
their cattle have conceived and failed not their cow has
calved and is not deprived of her fruit
their little ones go out like a flock and their children dance
and play
they take the timbrel and the harp and rejoice at the sound of
the organ
they spend their days in wealth and in a moment they go down to
hell
who have said to god depart from us we desire not the knowledge
of thy ways
who is the almighty that we should serve him and what doth it
profit us if we pray to him
yet because their good things are not in their hand may the
counsel of the wicked be far from me
how often shall the lamp of the wicked be put out and a deluge
come upon them and he shall distribute the sorrows of his wrath
they shall be as chaff before the face of the wind and as ashes
which the whirlwind scattereth
god shall lay up the sorrow of the father for his children and
when he shall repay then shall he know
his eyes shall see his own destruction and he shall drink of the
wrath of the almighty
for what is it to him what befalleth his house after him and if
the number of his months be diminished by one half
shall any one teach god knowledge who judgeth those that are
high
one man dieth strong and hale rich and happy
his bowels are full of fat and his bones are moistened with
marrow
but another dieth in bitterness of soul without any riches
and yet they shall sleep together in the dust and worms shall
cover them
surely i know your thoughts and your unjust judgments against
me
for you say where is the house of the prince and where are the
dwelling places of the wicked
ask any one of them that go by the way and you shall perceive
that he knoweth these same things
because the wicked man is reserved to the day of destruction and
he shall be brought to the day of wrath
who shall reprove his way to his face and who shall repay him
what he hath done
he shall be brought to the graves and shall watch in the heap of
the dead
he hath been acceptable to the gravel of cocytus and he shall
draw every man after him and there are innumerable before him
has here rendered by the name cocytus which the poets represent as a
river in hell signifies a valley or a torrent and in this place is
taken for the low region of death and hell which willingly as it were
receives the wicked at their death who are ushered in by innumerable
others that have gone before them and are followed by multitudes above
number
how then do ye comfort me in vain whereas your answer is shewn
to be repugnant to truth
if he will repent
then eliphaz the themanite answered and said
can man be compared with god even though he were of perfect
knowledge
what doth it profit god if thou be just or what dost thou give
him if thy way be unspotted
shall he reprove thee for fear and come with thee into judgment
and not for thy manifold wickedness and thy infinite iniquities
for thou hast taken away the pledge of thy brethren without cause
and stripped the naked of their clothing
thou hast not given water to the weary thou hast withdrawn bread
from the hungry
in the strength of thy arm thou didst possess the land and being
the most mighty thou holdest it
thou hast sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless
thou hast broken in pieces
therefore art thou surrounded with shares and sudden fear
troubleth thee
and didst thou think that thou shouldst not see darkness and
that thou shouldst not be covered with the violence of overflowing
waters
dost not thou think that god is higher than heaven and is
elevated above the height of the stars
and thou sayest what doth god know and he judgeth as it were
through a mist
the clouds are his covert and he doth not consider our things
and he walketh about the poles of heaven
dost thou desire to keep the path of ages which wicked men have
trodden
who were taken away before their time and a flood hath
overthrown their foundation
who said to god depart from us and looked upon the almighty as
if he could do nothing
whereas he had filled their houses with good things whose way of
thinking be far from me
the just shall see and shall rejoice and the innocent shall
laugh them to scorn
is not their exaltation cut down and hath not fire devoured the
remnants of them
submit thyself then to him and be at peace and thereby thou
shalt have the best fruits
receive the law of his mouth and lay up his words in thy heart
if thou wilt return to the almighty thou shalt be built up and
shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacle
he shall give for earth flint and for flint torrents of gold
and the almighty shall be against thy enemies and silver shall
be heaped together for thee
then shalt thou abound in delights in the almighty and shalt
lift up thy face to god
thou shalt pray to him and he will hear thee and thou shalt pay
vows
thou shalt decree a thing and it shall come to thee and light
shall shine in thy ways
for he that hath been humbled shall be in glory and he that
shall bow down his eyes he shall be saved
the innocent shall be saved and he shall be saved by the
cleanness of his hands
then job answered and said
now also my words are in bitterness and the hand of my scourge is
more grievous than my mourning
who will grant me that i might know and find him and come even to
his throne
i would set judgment before him and would fill my mouth with
complaints
that i might know the words that he would answer me and
understand what he would say to me
i would not that he should contend with me with much strength nor
overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness
let him propose equity against me and let my judgment come to
victory
but if i go to the east he appeareth not if to the west i shall
not understand him
if to the left hand what shall i do i shall not take hold on
him if i turn myself to the right hand i shall not see him
but he knoweth my way and has tried me as gold that passeth
through the fire
my foot hath followed his steps i have kept his way and have
not declined from it
i have not departed from the commandments of his lips and the
words of his mouth i have hid in my bosom
for he is alone and no man can turn away his thought and
whatsoever his soul hath desired that hath he done
and when he shall have fulfilled his will in me many other like
things are also at hand with him
and therefore i am troubled at his presence and when i consider
him i am made pensive with fear
god hath softened my heart and the almighty hath troubled me
for i have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over
me neither hath the mist covered my face
sins but punisheth them in another life
times are not hid from the almighty but they that know him know
not his days
some have removed landmarks have taken away flocks by force and
fed them
they have driven away the ass of the fatherless and have taken
away the widows ox for a pledge
they have overturned the way of the poor and have oppressed
together the meek of the earth
others like wild asses in the desert go forth to their work by
watching for a prey they get bread for their children
they reap the field that is not their own and gather the vintage
of his vineyard whom by violence they have oppressed
they send men away naked taking away their clothes who have no
covering in the cold
who are wet with the showers of the mountains and having no
covering embrace the stones
they have violently robbed the fatherless and stripped the poor
common people
from the naked and them that go without clothing and from the
hungry they have taken away the ears of corn
they have taken their rest at noon among the stores of them who
after having trodden the winepresses suffer thirst
out of the cities they have made men to groan and the soul of
the wounded hath cried out and god doth not suffer it to pass
unrevenged
they have been rebellious to the light they have not known his
ways neither have they returned by his paths
the murderer riseth at the very break of day he killeth the
needy and the poor man but in the night he will be as a thief
the eye of the adulterer observeth darkness saying no eye shall
see me and he will cover his face
he diggeth through houses in the dark as in the day they had
appointed for themselves and they have not known the light
if the morning suddenly appear it is to them the shadow of
death and they walk in darkness as if it were in light
he is light upon the face of the water cursed be his portion on
the earth let him not walk by the way of the vineyards
let him pass from the snow waters to excessive heat and his sin
even to hell
let mercy forget him may worms be his sweetness let him be
remembered no more but be broken in pieces as an unfruitful tree
for he hath fed the barren that beareth not and to the widow he
hath done no good
he hath pulled down the strong by his might and when he standeth
up he shall not trust to his life
god hath given him place for penance and he abuseth it unto
pride but his eyes are upon his ways
they are lifted up for a little while and shall not stand and
shall be brought down as all things and shall be taken away and as the
tops of the ears of corn they shall be broken
and if it be not so who can convince me that i have lied and
set my words before god
sins but punisheth them in another life
then baldad the suhite answered and i said
power and terror are with him who maketh peace in his high places
is there any numbering of his soldiers and upon whom shall not his light arise
can man be justified compared with god or he that is born of a woman appear clean
behold even the moon doth not shine and the stars are not pure in his sight
how much less man that is rottenness and the son of man who is a worm
then job answered and said
whose helper art thou is it of him that is weak and dost thou
hold up the arm of him that has no strength
to whom hast thou given counsel perhaps to him that hath no
wisdom and thou hast shewn thy very great prudence
whom hast thou desired to teach was it not him that made life
behold the giants groan under the waters and they that dwell with
them
hell is naked before him and there is no covering for
destruction
he stretched out the north over the empty space and hangeth the
earth upon nothing
he bindeth up the waters in his clouds so that they break not out
and fall down together
he withholdeth the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud
over it
he hath set bounds about the waters till light and darkness come
to an end
the pillars of heaven tremble and dread at his beck
by his power the seas are suddenly gathered together and his
wisdom has struck the proud one
his spirit hath adorned the heavens and his obstetric hand
brought forth the winding serpent
omnipotent power of god which brought forth all things created in time
but conceived in the divine mind from all eternity the winding serpent
a constellation of fixed stars winding round the north pole called
spirit hath adorned the heavens
lo these things are said in part of his ways and seeing we have
heard scarce a little drop of his word who shall be able to behold the
thunder of his greatness
punished in the end
job also added taking up his parable and said
as god liveth who hath taken away my judgment and the almighty
who hath brought my soul to bitterness
as long as breath remaineth in me and the spirit of god in my
nostrils
my lips shall not speak iniquity neither shall my tongue contrive
lying
god forbid that i should judge you to be just till i die i will
not depart from my innocence
my justification which i have begun to hold i will not forsake
for my heart doth not reprehend me in all my life
let my enemy be as the ungodly and my adversary as the wicked
one
for what is the hope of the hypocrite if through covetousness he
take by violence and god deliver not his soul
will god hear his cry when distress shall come upon him
or can he delight himself in the almighty and call upon god at
all times
i will teach you by the hand of god what the almighty hath and
behold you all know it and why do you speak vain things without
cause
this is the portion of a wicked man with god and the inheritance
of the violent which they shall receive of the almighty
if his sons be multiplied they shall be for the sword and his
grandsons shall not be filled with bread
they that shall remain of him shall be buried in death and his
widows shall not weep
if he shall heap together silver as earth and prepare raiment as
clay
he shall prepare indeed but the just man shall be clothed with
it and the innocent shall divide the silver
he hath built his house as a moth and as a keeper he hath made a
booth
the rich man when he shall sleep shall take away nothing with
him he shall open his eyes and find nothing
poverty like water shall take hold on him a tempest shall
oppress him in the night
a burning wind shall take him up and carry him away and as a
whirlwind shall snatch him from his place
and he shall cast upon him and shall not spare out of his hand
he would willingly flee
he shall clasp his hands upon him and shall hiss at him
beholding his place
alone
silver hath beginnings of its veins and gold hath a place wherein
it is melted
iron is taken out of the earth and stone melted with heat is
turned into brass
he hath set a time for darkness and the end of all things he
considereth the stone also that is in the dark and the shadow of death
the flood divideth from the people that are on their journey
those whom the food of the needy man hath forgotten and who cannot be
come at
the land out of which bread grew in its place hath been
overturned with fire
the stones of it are the place of sapphires and the clods of it
are gold
the bird hath not known the path neither hath the eye of the
vulture beheld it
the children of the merchants have not trodden it neither hath
the lioness passed by it
he hath stretched forth his hand to the flint he hath overturned
mountains from the roots
in the rocks he hath cut out rivers and his eye hath seen every
precious thing
the depths also of rivers he hath searched and hidden things he
hath brought forth to light
but where is wisdom to be found and where is the place of
understanding
man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the
land of them that live in delights
the depth saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not
with me
the finest gold shall not purchase it neither shall silver be
weighed in exchange for it
it shall not be compared with the dyed colours of india or with
the most precious stone sardonyx or the sapphire
gold or crystal cannot equal it neither shall any vessels of
gold be changed for it
high and eminent things shall not be mentioned in comparison of
it but wisdom is drawn out of secret places
the topaz of ethiopia shall not be equal to it neither shall it
be compared to the cleanest dyeing
whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of
understanding
it is hid from the eyes of all living and the fowls of the air
know it not
destruction and death have said with our ears we have heard the
fame thereof
god understandeth the way of it and he knoweth the place
thereof
for he beholdeth the ends of the world and looketh on all things
that are under heaven
who made a weight for the winds and weighed the waters by
measure
when he gave a law for the rain and a way for the sounding
storms
then he saw it and declared and prepared and searched it
and he said to man behold the fear of the lord that is wisdom
and to depart from evil is understanding
him
job also added taking up his parable and said
who will grant me that i might be according to the months past
according to the days in which god kept me
when his lamp shined over my head and i walked by his light in
darkness
as i was in the days of my youth when god was secretly in my
tabernacle
when the almighty was with me and my servants round about me
when i washed my feet with butter and the rock poured me out
rivers of oil
when i went out to the gate of the city and in the street they
prepared me a chair
the young men saw me and hid themselves and the old men rose up
and stood
the princes ceased to speak and laid the finger on their mouth
the rulers held their peace and their tongue cleaved to their
throat
the ear that heard me blessed me and the eye that saw me gave
witness to me
because i had delivered the poor man that cried out and the
fatherless that had no helper
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i
comforted the heart of the widow
i was clad with justice and i clothed myself with my judgment
as with a robe and a diadem
i was an eye to the blind and a foot to the lame
i was the father of the poor and the cause which i knew not i
searched out most diligently
i broke the jaws of the wicked man and out of his teeth i took
away the prey
and i said i shall die in my nest and as a palm tree shall
multiply my days
my root is opened beside the waters and dew shall continue in my
harvest
my glory shall always be renewed and my bow in my hand shall be
repaired
they that heard me waited for my sentence and being attentive
held their peace at my counsel
to my words they durst add nothing and my speech dropped upon
them
they waited for me as for rain and they opened their mouth as
for a latter shower
if at any time i laughed on them they believed not and the
light of my countenance fell not on earth
if i had a mind to go to them i sat first and when i sat as a
king with his army standing about him yet i was a comforter of them
that mourned
great calamity
but now the younger in time scorn me whose fathers i would not
have set with the dogs of my flock
were obscure when i was conspicuous and in magnificence they now look
down on me
the strength of whose hands was to me as nothing and they were
thought unworthy of life itself
barren with want and hunger who gnawed in the wilderness
disfigured with calamity and misery
and they ate grass and barks of trees and the root of junipers
was their food
who snatched up these things out of the valleys and when they had
found any of them they ran to them with a cry
they dwelt in the desert places of torrents and in caves of
earth or upon the gravel
they pleased themselves among these kind of things and counted it
delightful to be under the briers
the children of foolish and base men and not appearing at all
upon the earth
now i am turned into their song and am become their byword
they abhor me and flee far from me and are not afraid to spit
in my face
for he hath opened his quiver and hath afflicted me and hath
put a bridle into my mouth
at the right hand of my rising my calamities forthwith arose
they have overthrown my feet and have overwhelmed me with their paths
as with waves
they have destroyed my ways they have lain in wait against me
and they have prevailed and there was none to help
they have rushed in upon me as when a wall is broken and a gate
opened and have rolled themselves down to my miseries
i am brought to nothing as a wind thou hast taken away my
desire and my prosperity hath passed away like a cloud
and now my soul fadeth within myself and the days of affliction
possess me
in the night my bone is pierced with sorrows and they that feed
upon me do not sleep
with the multitude of them my garment is consumed and they have
girded me about as with the collar of my coat
i am compared to dirt and am likened to embers and ashes
i cry to thee and thou hearest me not i stand up and thou dost
not regard me
thou art changed to be cruel toward me and in the hardness of
thy hand thou art against me
thou hast lifted me up and set me as it were upon the wind and
thou hast mightily dashed me
i know that thou wilt deliver me to death where a house is
appointed for every one that liveth
but yet thou stretchest not forth thy hand to their consumption
and if they shall fall down thou wilt save
i wept heretofore for him that was afflicted and my soul had
compassion on the poor
i expected good things and evils are come upon me i waited for
light and darkness broke out
my inner parts have boiled without any rest the days of
affliction have prevented me
i went mourning without indignation i rose up and cried in the
crowd
i was the brother of dragons and companion of ostriches
noise
my skin is become black upon me and my bones are dried up with
heat
my harp is turned to mourning and my organ into the voice of
those that weep
sincere account of his own virtues
i made a covenant with my eyes that i would not so much as think
upon a virgin
for what part should god from above have in me and what
inheritance the almighty from on high
is not destruction to the wicked and aversion to them that work
iniquity
doth not he consider my ways and number all my steps
if i have walked in vanity and my foot hath made haste to deceit
let him weigh me in a just balance and let god know my
simplicity
if my step hath turned out of the way and if my heart hath
followed my eyes and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands
then let me sow and let another reap and let my offspring be
rooted out
if my heart hath been deceived upon a woman and if i have laid
wait at my friends door
let my wife be the harlot of another and let other men lie with
her
for this is a heinous crime and a most grievous iniquity
it is a fire that devoureth even to destruction and rooteth up
all things that spring
if i have despised to abide judgment with my manservant or my
maidservant when they had any controversy against me
for what shall i do when god shall rise to judge and when he
shall examine what shall i answer him
did not he that made me in the womb make him also and did not
one and the same form me in the womb
if i have denied to the poor what they desired and have made the
eyes of the widow wait
if i have eaten my morsel alone and the fatherless hath not
eaten thereof
for from my infancy mercy grew up with me and it came out with
me from my mothers womb
if i have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing
and the poor man that had no covering
if his sides have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with
the fleece of my sheep
if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless even when i
saw myself superior in the gate
let my shoulder fall from its joint and let my arm with its
bones be broken
for i have always feared god as waves swelling over me and his
weight i was unable to bear
if i have thought gold my strength and have said to fine gold
if i have rejoiced over my great riches and because my hand had
gotten much
if i beheld the sun when it shined and the moon going in
brightness
admiration knowing them to be created and governed by the power of god
could be charged with worshipping the sun or moon
and my heart in secret hath rejoiced and i have kissed my hand
with my mouth
which is a very great iniquity and a denial against the most
high god
if i have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me and
have rejoiced that evil had found him
for i have not given my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his
soul
if the men of my tabernacle have not said who will give us of
his flesh that we may be filled
the stranger did not stay without my door was open to the
traveller
if as a man i have hid my sin and have concealed my iniquity in
my bosom
if i have been afraid at a very great multitude and the contempt
of kinsmen hath terrified me and have not rather held my peace and not
gone out of the door
who would grant me a hearing that the almighty may hear my
desire and that he himself that judgeth would write a book
that i may carry it on my shoulder and put it about me as a
crown
at every step of mine i would pronounce it and offer it as to a
prince
if my land cry against me and with it the furrows thereof mourn
if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money and have
afflicted the son of the tillers thereof
let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat and thorns instead
of barley
so these three men ceased to answer job because he seemed just to
himself
and eliu the son of barachel the buzite of the kindred of ram was
angry and was moved to indignation now he was angry against job
because he said he was just before god
and he was angry with his friends because they had not found a
reasonable answer but only had condemned job
so eliu waited while job was speaking because they were his elders
that were speaking
but when he saw that the three were not able to answer he was
exceedingly angry
then eliu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i am
younger in days and you are more ancient therefore hanging down my
head i was afraid to shew you my opinion
for i hoped that greater age would speak and that a multitude of
years would teach wisdom
but as i see there is a spirit in men and the inspiration of
the almighty giveth understanding
they that are aged are not the wise men neither do the ancients
understand judgment
therefore i will speak hearken to me i also will shew you my
wisdom
for i have waited for your words i have given ear to your
wisdom as long as you were disputing in words
and as long as i thought you said some thing i considered but
as i see there is none of you that can convince job and answer his
words
lest you should say we have found wisdom god hath cast him
down not man
he hath spoken nothing to me and i will not answer him according
to your words
they were afraid and answered no more and they left off
speaking
therefore because i have waited and they have not spoken they
stood and answered no more
i also will answer my part and will shew my knowledge
for i am full of matter to speak of and the spirit of my bowels
straiteneth me
behold my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent which
bursteth the new vessels
i will speak and take breath a little i will open my lips and
will answer
i will not accept the person of man and i will not level god
with man
himself on a level with god by the manner he assumed to justify his own
life in speaking to god as if he spoke to an equal eliu expresses in
the following ver his fear of punishment hereafter for such an
attempt
for i know not how long i shall continue and whether after a
while my maker may take me away
hear therefore o job my speeches and hearken to all my words
behold now i have opened my mouth let my tongue speak within my
jaws
my words are from my upright heart and my lips shall speak a pure
sentence
the spirit of god made me and the breath of the almighty gave me
life
if thou canst answer me and stand up against my face
behold god hath made me as well as thee and of the same clay i
also was formed
but yet let not my wonder terrify thee and let not my eloquence
be burdensome to thee
now thou hast said in my hearing and i have heard the voice of
thy words
i am clean and without sin i am unspotted and there is no
iniquity in me
because he hath found complaints against me therefore he hath
counted me for his enemy
he hath put my feet in the stocks he hath observed all my paths
now this is the thing in which thou art not justified i will
answer thee that god is greater than man
dost thou strive against him because he hath not answered thee
to all words
god speaketh once and repeateth not the selfsame thing the
second time
by a dream in a vision by night when deep sleep falleth upon
men and they are sleeping in their beds
then he openeth the ears of men and teaching instructeth them in
what they are to learn
that he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing and may
deliver him from pride
rescuing his soul from corruption and his life from passing to
the sword
he rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed and he maketh all his
bones to wither
bread becometh abominable to him in his life and to his soul the
meat which before he desired
his flesh shall be consumed away and his bones that were covered
shall be made bare
his soul hath drawn near to corruption and his life to the
destroyers
if there shall be an angel speaking for him one among thousands
to declare mans uprightness
he shall have mercy on him and shall say deliver him that he
may not go down to corruption i have found wherein i may be merciful to
him
his flesh is consumed with punishments let him return to the
days of his youth
he shall pray to god and he will be gracious to him and he
shall see his face with joy and he will render to man his justice
he shall look upon men and shall say i have sinned and indeed
he hath delivered his soul from going into destruction that it
may live and see the light
behold all these things god worketh three times within every
one
that he may withdraw their souls from corruption and enlighten
them with the light of the living
attend job and hearken to me and hold thy peace whilst i
speak
but if thou hast any thing to say answer me speak for i would
have thee to appear just
and if thou have not hear me hold thy peace and i will teach
thee wisdom
and eliu continued his discourse and said
hear ye wise men my words and ye learned hearken to me
for the ear trieth words and the mouth discerneth meats by the
taste
let us choose to us judgment and let us see among ourselves what
is the best
for job hath said i am just and god hath overthrown my judgment
for in judging me there is a lie my arrow is violent without any
sin
what man is there like job who drinketh up scorning like water
who goeth in company with them that work iniquity and walketh
with wicked men
for he hath said man shall not please god although he run with
him
therefore ye men of understanding hear me far from god be
wickedness and iniquity from the almighty
for he will render to a man his work and according to the ways
of every one he will reward them
for in very deed god will not condemn without cause neither will
the almighty pervert judgment
what other hath he appointed over the earth or whom hath he set
over the world which he made
if he turn his heart to him he shall draw his spirit and breath
unto himself
all flesh shall perish together and man shall return into ashes
if then thou hast understanding hear what is said and hearken
to the voice of my words
can he be healed that loveth not judgment and how dost thou so
far condemn him that is just
who saith to the king thou art an apostate who calleth rulers
ungodly
who accepteth not the persons of princes nor hath regarded the
tyrant when he contended against the poor man for all are the work of
his hands
they shall suddenly die and the people shall be troubled at
midnight and they shall pass and take away the violent without hand
for his eyes are upon the ways of men and he considereth all
their steps
there is no darkness and there is no shadow of death where they
may be hid who work iniquity
for it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment
with god
he shall break in pieces many and innumerable and shall make
others to stand in their stead
for he knoweth their works and therefore he shall bring night on
them and they shall be destroyed
he hath struck them as being wicked in open sight
who as it were on purpose have revolted from him and would not
understand all his ways
so that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him and he
heard the voice of the poor
for when he granteth peace who is there that can condemn when
he hideth his countenance who is there that can behold him whether it
regard nations or all men
who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the
people
seeing then i have spoken of god i will not hinder thee in thy
turn
if i have erred teach thou me if i have spoken iniquity i will
add no more
doth god require it of thee because it hath displeased thee for
thou begannest to speak and not i but if thou know any thing better
speak
let men of understanding speak to me and let a wise man hearken
to me
but job hath spoken foolishly and his words sound not
discipline
my father let job be tried even to the end cease not from the
man of iniquity
because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins let him be tied fast
in the mean time amongst us and then let him provoke god to judgment
with his speeches
moreover eliu spoke these words
doth thy thought seem right to thee that thou shouldst say i am
more just than god
for thou saidst that which is right doth not please thee or what
will it profit thee if i sin
therefore i will answer thy words and thy friends with thee
look up to heaven and see and behold the sky that it is higher
than thee
if thou sin what shalt thou hurt him and if thy iniquities be
multiplied what shalt thou do against him
and if thou do justly what shalt thou give him or what shall he
receive of thy hand
thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee and thy justice
may help the son of man
by reason of the multitude of oppressors they shall cry out and
shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants
and he hath not said where is god who made me who hath given
songs in the night
who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and
instructeth us more than the fowls of the air
there shall they cry and he will not hear because of the pride
of evil men
god therefore will not hear in vain and the almighty will look
into the causes of every one
yea when thou shalt say he considereth not be judged before
him and expect him
for he doth not now bring on his fury neither doth he revenge
wickedness exceedingly
therefore job openeth his mouth in vain and multiplieth words
without knowledge
eliu also proceeded and said
suffer me a little and i will shew thee for i have yet somewhat
to speak in gods behalf
i will repeat my knowledge from the beginning and i will prove my
for indeed my words are without a lie and perfect knowledge shall
be proved to thee
god doth not cast away the mighty whereas he himself also is
mighty
but he saveth not the wicked and he giveth judgment to the poor
he will not take away his eyes from the just and he placeth kings
on the throne for ever and they are exalted
and if they shall be in chains and be bound with the cords of
poverty
he shall shew them their works and their wicked deeds because
they have been violent
he also shall open their ear to correct them and shall speak
that they may return from iniquity
if they shall hear and observe they shall accomplish their days
in good and their years in glory
but if they hear not they shall pass by the sword and shall be
consumed in folly
dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of god neither shall
they cry when they are bound
their soul shall die in a storm and their life among the
effeminate
he shall deliver the poor out of his distress and shall open his
ear in affliction
therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow mouth and
which hath no foundation under it and the rest of thy table shall be
full of fatness
narrow and its depth bottomless but figuratively meant here that is
from his miseries and calamity to be restored to his former state of
happiness
thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked cause and
judgment thou shalt recover
therefore let not anger overcome thee to oppress any man neither
let multitude of gifts turn thee aside
lay down thy greatness without tribulation and all the mighty of
strength
prolong not the night that people may come up for them
beware thou turn not aside to iniquity for this thou hast begun
to follow after misery
that notwithstanding his misery he does not fear god as he ought but
in his judgment falls into iniquity
behold god is high in his strength and none is like him among
the lawgivers
who can search out his ways or who can say to him thou hast
wrought iniquity
remember that thou knowest not his work concerning which men
have sung
all men see him every one beholdeth afar off
behold god is great exceeding our knowledge the number of his
years is inestimable
he lifteth up the drops of rain and poureth out showers like
floods
which flow from the clouds that cover all above
if he will spread out clouds as his tent
and lighten with his light from above he shall cover also the
ends of the sea
for by these he judgeth people and giveth food to many mortals
in his hands he hideth the light and commandeth it to come
again
he sheweth his friend concerning it that it is his possession
and that he may come up to it
wonderful works
at this my heart trembleth and is moved out of its place
hear ye attentively the terror of his voice and the sound that
cometh out of his mouth
he beholdeth under all the heavens and his light is upon the ends
of the earth
after it a noise shall roar he shall thunder with the voice of
his majesty and shall not be found out when his voice shall be heard
god shall thunder wonderfully with his voice he that doth great
and unsearchable things
he commandeth the snow to go down upon the earth and the winter
rain and the shower of his strength
he sealeth up the hand of all men that every one may know his
works
is those storms of rain he seals up that is he shuts up the hands of
men from their usual works abroad and confines them within doors to
consider his works or to forecast their works that is what they
themselves are to do
then the beast shall go into his covert and shall abide in his
den
out of the inner parts shall a tempest come and cold out of the
north
when god bloweth there cometh frost and again the waters are
poured out abundantly
corn desireth clouds and the clouds spread their light
which go round about whithersoever the will of him that
governeth them shall lead them to whatsoever he shall command them upon
the face of the whole earth
whether in one tribe or in his own land or in what place soever
of his mercy he shall command them to be found
hearken to these things job stand and consider the wondrous
works of god
dost thou know when god commanded the rains to shew his light of
his clouds
knowest thou the great paths of the clouds and the perfect
knowledges
are not thy garments hot when the south wind blows upon the
earth
thou perhaps hast made the heavens with him which are most
strong as if they were of molten brass
shew us what we may say to him or we are wrapped up in darkness
who shall tell him the things i speak even if a man shall speak
he shall be swallowed up
is so little and inconsiderable in comparison with the subject that man
is lost and as it were swallowed up in so immense an ocean
but now they see not the light the air on a sudden shall be
thickened into clouds and the wind shall pass and drive them away
cold cometh out of the north and to god praise with fear
we cannot find him worthily he is great in strength and in
judgment and in justice and he is ineffable
therefore men shall fear him and all that seem to themselves to
be wise shall not dare to behold him
comprehend his power and wisdom
then the lord answered job out of a whirlwind and said
who is this that wrappeth up sentences in unskilful words
gird up thy loins like a man i will ask thee and answer thou me
where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth tell me
if thou hast understanding
who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath
stretched the line upon it
upon what are its bases grounded or who laid the corner stone
thereof
when the morning stars praised me together and all the sons of
who shut up the sea with doors when it broke forth as issuing out
of the womb
when i made a cloud the garment thereof and wrapped it in a mist
as in swaddling bands
i set my bounds around it and made it bars and doors
and i said hitherto thou shalt come and shalt go no further
and here thou shalt break thy swelling waves
didst thou since thy birth command the morning and shew the
dawning of the day its place
and didst thou hold the extremities of the earth shaking them
and hast thou shaken the ungodly out of it
the seal shall be restored as clay and shall stand as a garment
from the wicked their light shall be taken away and the high arm
shall be broken
hast thou entered into the depths of the sea and walked in the
lowest parts of the deep
have the gates of death been opened to thee and hast thou seen
the darksome doors
hast thou considered the breadth of the earth tell me if thou
knowest all things
where is the way where light dwelleth and where is the place of
darkness
that thou mayst bring every thing to its own bounds and
understand the paths of the house thereof
didst thou know then that thou shouldst be born and didst thou
know the number of thy days
hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow or hast thou
beheld the treasures of the hail
which i have prepared for the time of the enemy against the day
of battle and war
by what way is the light spread and heat divided upon the earth
who gave a course to violent showers or a way for noisy thunder
that it should rain on the earth without man in the wilderness
where no mortal dwelleth
that it should fill the desert and desolate land and should
bring forth green grass
who is the father of rain or who begot the drops of dew
out of whose womb came the ice and the frost from heaven who
hath gendered it
the waters are hardened like a stone and the surface of the deep
is congealed
shalt thou be able to join together the shining stars the
others the great bear is understood
canst thou bring forth the day star in its time and make the
evening star to rise upon the children of the earth
dost thou know the order of heaven and canst thou set down the
reason thereof on the earth
canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that an abundance of
waters may cover thee
canst thou send lightnings and will they go and will they
return and say to thee here we are
who hath put wisdom in the heart of man or who gave the cock
understanding
crowing in the night
who can declare the order of the heavens or who can make the
harmony of heaven to sleep
when was the dust poured on the earth and the clods fastened
together
wilt thou take the prey for the lioness and satisfy the appetite
of her whelps
when they couch in the dens and lie in wait in holes
who provideth food for the raven when her young ones cry to god
wandering about because they have no meat
his creatures
knowest thou the time when the wild goats bring forth among the
rocks or hast thou observed the hinds when they fawn
hast thou numbered the months of their conceiving or knowest thou
the time when they bring forth
they bow themselves to bring forth young and they cast them and
send forth roarings
their young are weaned and go to feed they go forth and return
not to them
who hath sent out the wild ass free and who hath loosed his
bonds
to whom i have given a house in the wilderness and his dwellings
in the barren land
he scorneth the multitude of the city he heareth not the cry of
the driver
he looketh round about the mountains of his pasture and seeketh
for every green thing
shall the rhinoceros be willing to serve thee or will he stay at
thy crib
canst thou bind the rhinoceros with thy thong to plough or will
he break the clods of the valleys after thee
wilt thou have confidence in his great strength and leave thy
labours to him
wilt thou trust him that he will render thee the seed and gather
it into thy barnfloor
the wing of the ostrich is like the wings of the heron and of
the hawk
when she leaveth her eggs on the earth thou perhaps wilt warm
them in the dust
she forgetteth that the foot may tread upon them or that the
beasts of the field may break them
she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not
hers she hath laboured in vain no fear constraining her
for god hath deprived her of wisdom neither hath he given her
understanding
when time shall be she setteth up her wings on high she
scorneth the horse and his rider
wilt thou give strength to the horse or clothe his neck with
neighing
wilt thou lift him up like the locusts the glory of his nostrils
is terror
he breaketh up the earth with his hoof he pranceth boldly he
goeth forward to meet armed men
he despiseth fear he turneth not his back to the sword
above him shall the quiver rattle the spear and shield shall
glitter
chasing and raging he swalloweth the ground neither doth he make
account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth
when he heareth the trumpet he saith ha ha he smelleth the
battle afar off the encouraging of the captains and the shouting of
the army
doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom spreading her wings to
the south
will the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest in high
places
she abideth among the rocks and dwelleth among cragged flints
and stony hills where there is no access
from thence she looketh for the prey and her eyes behold afar
off
her young ones shall suck up blood and wheresoever the carcass
shall be she is immediately there
and the lord went on and said to job
shall he that contendeth with god be so easily silenced surely
he that reproveth god ought to answer him
then job answered the lord and said
what can i answer who hath spoken inconsiderately i will lay my
hand upon my mouth
from the words of the lord himself chap ver but what was
reprehensible in him was the manner of expressing himself at times
speaking too much of his own affliction and too little of gods
goodness towards him which here he acknowledges as inconsiderate
one thing i have spoken which i wish i had not said and
another to which i will add no more
and the lord answering job out of the whirlwind said
gird up thy loins like a man i will ask thee and do thou tell
me
wilt thou make void my judgment and condemn me that thou mayst
be justified
and hast thou an arm like god and canst thou thunder with a voice
like him
clothe thyself with beauty and set thyself up on high and be
glorious and put on goodly garments
scatter the proud in thy indignation and behold every arrogant
man and humble him
look on all that are proud and confound them and crush the
wicked in their place
hide them in the dust together and plunge their faces into the
pit
then i will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee
behold behemoth whom i made with thee he eateth grass like an
ox
many authors explain that here it is put for the elephant
his strength is in his loins and his force in the navel of his
belly
he setteth up his tail like a cedar the sinews of his testicles
are wrapped together
his bones are like pipes of brass his gristle like plates of
iron
he is the beginning of the ways of god who made him he will
apply his sword
explain the sword the horn given to the animal for his defence others
the power that god hath given to the animal for his defence others the
power that god hath given to man to slay him notwithstanding his great
size and strength
to him the mountains bring forth grass there all the beasts of
the field shall play
he sleepeth under the shadow in the covert of the reed and in
moist places
the shades cover his shadow the willows of the brook shall
compass him about
behold he will drink up a river and not wonder and he trusteth
that the jordan may run into his mouth
in his eyes as with a hook he shall take him and bore through
his nostrils with stakes
canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook or canst thou tie
his tongue with a cord
canst thou put a ring in his nose or bore through his jaw with a
buckle
will he make many supplications to thee or speak soft words to
thee
will he make a covenant with thee and wilt thou take him to be a
servant for ever
shalt thou play with him as with a bird or tie him up for thy
handmaids
shall friends cut him in pieces shall merchants divide him
wilt thou fill nets with his skin and the cabins of fishes with
his head
lay thy hand upon him remember the battle and speak no more
behold his hope shall fail him and in the sight of all he shall
be cast down
i will not stir him up like one that is cruel for who can resist
my countenance
who hath given me before that i should repay him all things that
are under heaven are mine
i will not spare him nor his mighty words and framed to make
supplication
who can discover the face of his garment or who can go into the
midst of his mouth
who can open the doors of his face his teeth are terrible round
about
his body is like molten shields shut close up with scales
pressing upon one another
one is joined to another and not so much as any air can come
between them
they stick one to another and they hold one another fast and
shall not be separated
his sneezing is like the shining of fire and his eyes like the
eyelids of the morning
out of his mouth go forth lamps like torches of lighted fire
out of his nostrils goeth smoke like that of a pot heated and
boiling
his breath kindleth coals and a flame cometh forth out of his
mouth
in his neck strength shall dwell and want goeth before his face
the members of his flesh cleave one to another he shall send
lightnings against him and they shall not be carried to another place
his heart shall be as hard as a stone and as firm as a smiths
anvil
when he shall raise him up the angels shall fear and being
affrighted shall purify themselves
valiant shall fear this monstrous fish and in their fear shall seek to
be purified
when a sword shall lay at him it shall not be able to hold nor
a spear nor a breastplate
for he shall esteem iron as straw and brass as rotten wood
the archer shall not put him to flight the stones of the sling
are to him like stubble
as stubble will he esteem the hammer and he will laugh him to
scorn who shaketh the spear
the beams of the sun shall be under him and he shall strew gold
under him like mire
shall be like mire
he shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot and shall make it
as when ointments boil
a path shall shine after him he shall esteem the deep as growing
old
which he leaves behind him
there is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who
was made to fear no one
he beholdeth every high thing he is king over all the children
of pride
strong amongst living creatures mystically it is understood of the
devil who is king over all the proud
for his friends he is blessed with riches and children and dies
happily
then job answered the lord and said
i know that thou canst do all things and no thought is hid from
thee
who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore i
have spoken unwisely and things that above measure exceeded my
knowledge
hear and i will speak i will ask thee and do thou tell me
with the hearing of the ear i have heard thee but now my eye
seeth thee
therefore i reprehend myself and do penance in dust and ashes
and after the lord had spoken these words to job he said to
two friends because you have not spoken the thing that is right before
me as my servant job hath
take unto you therefore seven oxen and seven rams and go to my
servant job and offer for yourselves a holocaust and my servant job
shall pray for you his face i will accept that folly be not imputed to
you for you have not spoken right things before me as my servant job
hath
so eliphaz the themanite and baldad the suhite and sophar the
accepted the face of job
the lord also was turned at the penance of job when he prayed
for his friends and the lord gave job twice as much as he had before
and all his brethren came to him and all his sisters and all
that knew him before and they ate bread with him in his house and
bemoaned him and comforted him upon all the evil that god had brought
upon him and every man gave him one ewe and one earring of gold
and the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his
beginning and he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels
and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand sheasses
and he had seven sons and three daughters
and he called the name of one dies and the name of the second
and there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as
the daughters of job and their father gave them inheritance among their
brethren
and job lived after these things a hundred and forty years and
he saw his children and his childrens children unto the fourth
generation and he died an old man and full of days
are of opinion that some of them were made by asaph and others whose
names are prefixed in the titles
