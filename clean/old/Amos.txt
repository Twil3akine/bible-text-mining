judgments of god for their obstinacy in sin
the words of amos who was among the herdsmen of thecua which he
saw concerning israel in the days of ozias king of juda and in the days
of jeroboam the son of joas king of israel two years before the
earthquake
say was felt at the time that king ozias attempted to offer incense in
the temple but the best chronologists prove that the earthquake here
spoken of must have been before that time because jeroboam the second
under whom amos prophesied was dead long before that attempt of ozias
and he said the lord will roar from sion and utter his voice from
the top of carmel is withered
thus saith the lord for three crimes of damascus and for four i
will not convert it because they have thrashed galaad with iron wains
crimesibid i will not convert it that is i will not spare them
nor turn away the punishments i design to inflict upon them
and i will send a fire into the house of azael and it shall devour
the houses of benadad
and i will break the bar of damascus and i will cut off the
inhabitants from the plain of the idol and him that holdeth the sceptre
from the house of pleasure and the people of syria shall be carried
away to cyrene saith the lord
thus saith the lord for three crimes of gaza and for four i will
not convert it because they have carried away a perfect captivity to
shut them up in edom
and i will send a fire on the wall of gaza and it shall devour the
houses thereof
and i will cut off the inhabitant from azotus and him that holdeth
the sceptre from ascalon and i will turn my hand against accaron and
the rest of the philistines shall perish saith the lord god
thus saith the lord for three crimes of tyre and for four i will
not convert it because they have shut up an entire captivity in edom
and have not remembered the covenant of brethren
and i will send a fire upon the wall of tyre and it shall devour
the houses thereof
thus saith the lord for three crimes of edom and for four i will
not convert him because he hath pursued his brother with the sword and
hath carried on his fury and hath kept his wrath to the end
i will send a fire into theman and it shall devour the houses of
thus saith the lord for three crimes of the children of ammon
and for four i will not convert him because he hath ripped up the women
with child of galaad to enlarge his border
and i will kindle a fire in the wall of rabba and it shall devour
the houses thereof with shouting in the day of battle and with a
whirlwind in the day of trouble
and melchom shall go into captivity both he and his princes
together saith the lord
and melech which in hebrew signifies a king and melchom their king
sins and their ingratitude

not convert him because he hath burnt the bones of the king of edom
even to ashes
and i will send a fire into moab and it shall devour the houses of
and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof and will slay
all his princes with him saith the lord
thus saith the lord for three crimes of juda and for four i will
not convert him because he hath cast away the law of the lord and hath
not kept his commandments for their idols have caused them to err
after which their fathers have walked
and i will send a fire into juda and it shall devour the houses of
thus saith the lord for three crimes of israel and for four i
will not convert him because he hath sold the just man for silver and
the poor man for a pair of shoes
they bruise the heads of the poor upon the dust of the earth and
turn aside the way of the humble and the son and his father have gone
to the same young woman to profane my holy name
and they sat down upon garments laid to pledge by every altar and
drank the wine of the condemned in the house of their god
yet i cast out the amorrhite before their face whose height was
like the height of cedars and who was strong as an oak and i destroyed
his fruit from above and his roots beneath
it is i that brought you up out of the land of egypt and i led
you forty years through the wilderness that you might possess the land
of the amorrhite
and i raised up of your sons for prophets and of your young men
for nazarites is it not so o ye children of israel saith the lord
and you will present wine to the nazarites and command the
prophets saying prophesy not
behold i will screak under you as a wain screaketh that is laden
with hay
sins etc the spirit of god as st jerome takes notice accommodates
himself to the education of the prophet and inspires him with
comparisons taken from country affairs
and flight shall perish from the swift and the valiant shall not
possess his strength neither shall the strong save his life
and he that holdeth the bow shall not stand and the swift of foot
shall not escape neither shall the rider of the horse save his life
and the stout of heart among the valiant shall flee away naked in
that day saith the lord
hear the word that the lord hath spoken concerning you o ye
children of israel concerning the whole family that i brought up out of
the land of egypt saying
you only have i known of all the families of the earth therefore
will i visit upon you all your iniquities
shall two walk together except they be agreed
will a lion roar in the forest if he have no prey will the lions
whelp cry out of his den if he have taken nothing
will the bird fall into the snare upon the earth if there be no
fowler shall the snare be taken up from the earth before it hath taken
somewhat
shall the trumpet sound in a city and the people not be afraid
pestilence desolation etc but not of the evil of sin of which god
is not the author
for the lord god doth nothing without revealing his secret to his
servants the prophets
the lion shall roar who will not fear the lord god hath spoken
who shall not prophesy
publish it in the houses of azotus and in the houses of the land
of egypt and say assemble yourselves upon the mountains of samaria
and behold the many follies in the midst thereof and them that suffer
oppression in the inner rooms thereof
and they have not known to do the right thing saith the lord
storing up iniquity and robberies in their houses
therefore thus saith the lord god the land shall be in
tribulation and shall be compassed about and thy strength shall be
taken away from thee and thy houses shall be spoiled
thus saith the lord as if a shepherd should get out of the lions
mouth two legs or the tip of the ear so shall the children of israel
be taken out that dwell in samaria in a place of a bed and in the
couch of damascus
hear ye and testify in the house of jacob saith the lord the god
of hosts
that in the day when i shall begin to visit the transgressions of
horns of the altars shall be cut off and shall fall to the ground
and i will strike the winter house with the summer house and the
houses of ivory shall perish and many houses shall be destroyed saith
the lord
idolatry and their incorrigibleness
hear this word ye fat kine that are in the mountains of samaria
you that oppress the needy and crush the poor that say to your
masters bring and we will drink
the lord god hath sworn by his holiness that lo the days shall
come upon you when they shall lift you up on pikes and what shall
remain of you in boiling pots
and you shall go out at the breaches one over against the other
and you shall be cast forth into armon saith the lord
come ye to bethel and do wickedly to galgal and multiply
transgressions and bring in the morning your victims your tithes in
three days
and offer a sacrifice of praise with leaven and call free
offerings and proclaim it for so you would do o children of israel
saith the lord god
whereupon i also have given you dulness of teeth in all your
cities and want of bread in all your places yet you have not returned
to me saith the lord
i also have withholden the rain from you when there were yet three
months to the harvest and i caused it to rain upon on city and caused
it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained upon and the
piece whereupon i rained not withered
and two and three cities went to one city to drink water and were
not filled yet you returned not to me saith the lord
i struck you with a burning wind and with mildew the palmerworm
hath eaten up your many gardens and your vineyards your olive groves
and fig groves yet you returned not to me saith the lord
i sent death upon you in the way of egypt i slew your young men
with the sword even to the captivity of your horses and i made the
stench of your camp to come up into your nostrils yet you returned not
to me saith the lord
i destroyed some of you as god destroyed sodom and gomorrha and
you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning yet you returned not
to me saith the lord
therefore i will do these things to thee o israel and after i
shall have done these things to thee be prepared to meet thy god o
for behold he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind
and declareth his word to man he that maketh the morning mist and
walketh upon the high places of the earth the lord the god of hosts is
his name
hear ye this word which i take up concerning you for a
lamentation the house of israel is fallen and it shall rise no more
the virgin of israel is cast down upon her land there is none to
raise her up
for thus saith the lord god the city out of which came forth a
thousand there shall be left in it a hundred and out of which there
came a hundred there shall be left in it ten in the house of israel
for thus saith the lord to the house of israel seek ye me and you
shall live
but seek not bethel and go not into galgal neither shall you pass
over to bersabee for galgal shall go into captivity and bethel shall
be unprofitable
idols
seek ye the lord and live lest the house of joseph be burnt with
fire and it shall devour and there shall be none to quench bethel
you that turn judgment into wormwood and forsake justice in the
land
seek him that maketh arcturus and orion and that turneth darkness
into morning and that changeth day into night that calleth the waters
of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is
his name
beautiful constellation in the south
he that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the strong and
waste upon the mighty
they have hated him that rebuketh in the gate and have abhorred
him that speaketh perfectly
therefore because you robbed the poor and took the choice prey
from him you shall build houses with square stone and shall not dwell
in them you shall plant most delightful vineyards and shall not drink
the wine of them
because i know your manifold crimes and your grievous sins
enemies of the just taking bribes and oppressing the poor in the gate
therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time for it is
an evil time
seek ye good and not evil that you may live and the lord the
hate evil and love good and establish judgment in the gate it
may be the lord the god of hosts may have mercy on the remnant of
therefore thus saith the lord the god of hosts the sovereign lord
without they shall say alas alas and they shall call the husbandman
to mourning and such as are skilful in lamentation to lament
and in all vineyards there shall be wailing because i will pass
through in the midst of thee saith the lord
woe to them that desire the day of the lord to what end is it for
you the day of the lord is darkness and not light
as if a man should flee from the face of a lion and a bear should
meet him or enter into the house and lean with his hand upon the wall
and a serpent should bite him
shall not the day of the lord be darkness and not light and
obscurity and no brightness in it
i hate and have rejected your festivities and i will not receive
the odour of your assemblies
and if you offer me holocausts and your gifts i will not receive
them neither will i regard the vows of your fat beasts
take away from me the tumult of thy songs and i will not hear the
canticles of thy harp
but judgment shall be revealed as water and justice as a mighty
torrent
did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for forty
years o house of israel
first in the dedication of the tabernacle the israelites offered no
sacrifices in the desert
but you carried a tabernacle for your moloch and the image of your
idols the star of your god which you made to yourselves
committed when they were drawn away by the daughters of moab to the
worship of their gods num
and i will cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus saith
the lord the god of hosts is his name
woe to you that are wealthy in sion and to you that have
confidence in the mountain of samaria ye great men heads of the
people that go in with state into the house of israel
pass ye over to chalane and see and go from thence into emath the
great and go down into geth of the philistines and to all the best
kingdoms of these if their border be larger than your border
you that are separated unto the evil day and that approach to the
throne of iniquity
you that sleep upon beds of ivory and are wanton on your couches
that eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of
the herd
you that sing to the sound of the psaltery they have thought
themselves to have instruments of music like david
that drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the best
ointments and they are not concerned for the affliction of joseph
wherefore now they shall go captive at the head of them that go
into captivity and the faction of the luxurious ones shall be taken
away
the lord god hath sworn by his own soul saith the lord the god of
hosts i detest the pride of jacob and i hate his houses and i will
deliver up the city with the inhabitants thereof
and if there remain ten men in one house they also shall die
and a mans kinsman shall take him up and shall burn him that he
may carry the bones out of the house and he shall say to him that is in
the inner rooms of the house is there yet any with thee
and he shall answer there is an end and he shall say to him
for behold the lord hath commanded and he will strike the greater
house with breaches and the lesser house with clefts
can horses run upon the rocks or can any one plough with buffles
for you have turned judgment into bitterness and the fruit of justice
into wormwood
you that rejoice in a thing of nought you that say have we not
taken unto us horns by our own strength
but behold i will raise up a nation against you o house of
the entrance of emath even to the torrent of the desert
accused of treason by the false priest of bethel
these things the lord god shewed to me and behold the locust was
formed in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter rain and lo
it was the latter rain after the kings mowing
prophets intercession were moderated signify the former invasions of
the assyrians under phul and theglathphalasar before the utter
desolation of israel by salmanasar
and it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the
grass of the land i said o lord god be merciful i beseech thee who
shall raise up jacob for he is very little
the lord had pity upon this it shall not be said the lord
these things the lord god shewed to me and behold the lord called
for judgment unto fire and it devoured the great deep and ate up a
part at the same time
and i said o lord god cease i beseech thee who shall raise up
the lord had pity upon this yea this also shall not be said the
these things the lord shewed to me and behold the lord was
standing upon a plastered wall and in his hand a masons trowel
and the lord said to me what seest thou amos and i said a
masons trowel and the lord said behold i will lay down the trowel in
the midst of my people israel i will plaster them over no more
and the high places of the idol shall be thrown down and the
sanctuaries of israel shall be laid waste and i will rise up against
the house of jeroboam with the sword
and amasias the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of israel
saying amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the house of
for thus saith amos jeroboam shall die by the sword and israel
shall be carried away captive out of their own land
that the lord would rise up against the house of jeroboam with the
sword which was verified when zacharias the son and successor of
and amasias said to amos thou seer go flee away into the land
of juda and eat bread there and prophesy there
but prophesy not again any more in bethel because it is the
kings sanctuary and it is the house of the kingdom
and amos answered and said to amasias i am not a prophet nor am
prophesying my calling or profession but i am a herdsman whom god was
pleased to send hither to prophesy to israel
and the lord took me when i followed the flock and the lord said
to me go prophesy to my people israel
and now hear thou the word of the lord thou sayest thou shalt
not prophesy against israel and thou shalt not drop thy word upon the
house of the idol
therefore thus saith the lord thy wife shall play the harlot in
the city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword and
thy land shall be measured by a line and thou shalt die in a polluted
land and israel shall go into captivity out of their land
approaching desolation of israel is foreshewed for their avarice and
injustices
these things the lord shewed to me and behold a hook to draw down
the fruit
and he said what seest thou amos and i said a hook to draw down
fruit and the lord said to me the end is come upon my people israel i
will not again pass by them any more
and the hinges of the temple shall screak in that day saith the
hear this you that crush the poor and make the needy of the land
to fail
saying when will the month be over and we shall sell our wares
and the sabbath and we shall open the corn that we may lessen the
measure and increase the sicle and may convey in deceitful balances
that we may possess the needy for money and the poor for a pair of
shoes and may sell the refuse of the corn
the lord hath sworn against the pride of jacob surely i will never
forget all their works
shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that
dwelleth therein and rise up altogether as a river and be cast out
and run down as the river of egypt
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord god that the
sun shall go down at midday and i will make the earth dark in the day
of light
and i will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into
lamentation and i will bring up sackcloth upon every back of yours and
baldness upon every head and i will make it as the mourning of an only
son and the latter end thereof as a bitter day
behold the days come saith the lord and i will send forth a
famine into the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst of water but
of hearing the word of the lord
and they shall move from sea to sea and from the north to the
east they shall go about seeking the word of the lord and shall not
find it
in that day the fair virgins and the young men shall faint for
thirst
they that swear by the sin of samaria and say thy god o dan
liveth and the way of bersabee liveth and they shall fall and shall
rise no more
tabernacle of david and the conversion of the gentiles to the church
which shall flourish for ever
i saw the lord standing upon the altar and he said strike the
hinges and let the lintels be shook for there is covetousness in the
head of them all and i will slay the last of them with the sword there
shall be no flight for them they shall flee and he that shall flee of
them shall not be delivered
though they go down even to hell thence shall my hand bring them
out and though they climb up to heaven thence will i bring them down
and though they be hid in the top of carmel i will search and take
them away from thence and though they hide themselves from my eyes in
the depth of the sea there will i command the serpent and he shall bite
them
and if they go into captivity before their enemies there will i
command the sword and it shall kill them and i will set my eyes upon
them for evil and not for good
and the lord the god of hosts is he who toucheth the earth and it
shall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall rise up
as a river and shall run down as the river of egypt
he that buildeth his ascension in heaven and hath founded his
bundle upon the earth who calleth the waters of the sea and poureth
them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name
his church bound up together by the bands of one faith and communion
are not you as the children of the ethiopians unto me o children
of israel saith the lord did not i bring up israel out of the land of
iniquities
behold the eyes of the lord god are upon the sinful kingdom and i
will destroy it from the face of the earth but yet i will not utterly
destroy the house of jacob saith the lord
for behold i will command and i will sift the house of israel
among all nations as corn is sifted in a sieve and there shall not a
little stone fall to the ground
all the sinners of my people shall fall by the sword who say the
evils shall not approach and shall not come upon us
in that day i will raise up the tabernacle of david that is
fallen and i will close up the breaches of the walls thereof and
repair what was fallen and i will rebuild it as in the days of old
that they may possess the remnant of edom and all nations
because my name is invoked upon them saith the lord that doth these
things
behold the days come saith the lord when the ploughman shall
overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed and
the mountains shall drop sweetness and every hill shall be tilled
blessings which as it were by a constant succession shall enrich the
church of christ
and i will bring back the captivity of my people israel and they
shall build the abandoned cities and inhabit them and they shall plant
vineyards and drink the wine of them and shall make gardens and eat
the fruits of them and i will plant them upon their own land and i
will no more pluck them out of their land which i have given them saith
the lord thy god
to have prophesied about the same time as osee joel and amos though
some of the hebrews who believe him to be the same with achabs
steward make him much more ancient his prophecy is the shortest of any
in number of words but yields to none says st jerome in the
sublimity of mysteries it contains but one chapter
