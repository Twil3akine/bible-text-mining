the vision of abdias thus saith the lord god to edom we have
heard a rumour from the lord and he hath sent an ambassador to the
nations arise and let us rise up to battle against him
behold i have made thee small among the nations thou art exceeding
contemptible
the pride of thy heart hath lifted thee up who dwellest in the
clefts of the rocks and settest up thy throne on high who sayest in
thy heart who shall bring me down to the ground
though thou be exalted as an eagle and though thou set thy nest
among the stars thence will i bring thee down saith the lord
if thieves had gone in to thee if robbers by night how wouldst
thou have held thy peace would they not have stolen till they had
enough if the grapegatherers had come in to thee would they not have
left thee at the least a cluster
how have they searched esau how have they sought out his hidden
things
they have sent thee out even to the border all the men of thy
confederacy have deceived thee the men of thy peace have prevailed
against thee they that eat with thee shall lay snares under thee there

in the day when thou stoodest against him when strangers carried
away his army captive and foreigners entered into his gates and cast
lots upon jerusalem thou also wast as one of them
but thou shalt not look on in the day of thy brother in the day

reprehension for what they had done and at the same time a declaration
that these things should not pass unpunishedibid thou shalt not
magnify thy mouth that is thou shalt not speak arrogantly against
the children of juda as insulting them in their distress
neither shalt thou enter into the gate of my people in the day of
their ruin neither shalt thou also look on in his evils in the day of
his calamity and thou shalt not be sent out against his army in the day
of his desolation
neither shalt thou stand in the crossways to kill them that flee
and thou shalt not shut up them that remain of him in the day of
tribulation
for the day of the lord is at hand upon all nations as thou hast
done so shall it be done to thee he will turn thy reward upon thy own
head
for as you have drunk upon my holy mountain so all nations shall
drink continually and they shall drink and sup up and they shall be
as though they were not
and in mount sion shall be salvation and it shall be holy and
the house of jacob shall possess those that possessed them
and the house of jacob shall be a fire and the house of joseph a
flame and the house of esau stubble and they shall be kindled in them
and shall devour them and there shall be no remains of the house of

places of the chanaanites even to sarepta and the captivity of
and saviours shall come up into mount sion to judge the mount of
borders of israel he was of geth opher in the tribe of zabulon and
consequently of galilee which confutes that assertion of the pharisees
