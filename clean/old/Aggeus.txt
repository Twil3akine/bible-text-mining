encouraged to set about the work
in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month in the
first day of the month the word of the lord came by the hand of aggeus
the prophet to zorobabel the son of salathiel governor of juda and to
thus saith the lord of hosts saying this people saith the time
is not yet come for building the house of the lord
and the word of the lord came by the hand of aggeus the prophet
saying
is it time for you to dwell in ceiled houses and this house lie
desolate
and now thus saith the lord of hosts set your hearts to consider
your ways
you have sowed much and brought in little you have eaten but
have not had enough you have drunk but have not been filled with
drink you have clothed yourselves but have not been warmed and he
that hath earned wages put them into a bag with holes
thus saith the lord of hosts set your hearts upon your ways
go up to the mountain bring timber and build the house and it
shall be acceptable to me and i shall be glorified saith the lord
you have looked for more and behold it became less and you
brought it home and i blowed it away why saith the lord of hosts
because my house is desolate and you make haste every man to his own
house
therefore the heavens over you were stayed from giving dew and
the earth was hindered from yielding her fruits
and i called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains
and upon the corn and upon the wine and upon the oil and upon all
that the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon beasts and upon
all the labour of the hands
then zorobabel the son of salathiel and jesus the son of josedec
the high priest and all the remnant of the people hearkened to the
voice of the lord their god and to the words of aggeus the prophet as
the lord their god sent him to them and the people feared before the
and aggeus the messenger of the lord as one of the messengers of
the lord spoke saying to the people i am with you saith the lord
and the lord stirred up the spirit of zorobabel the son of
the high priest and the spirit of all the rest of the people and they
went in and did the work in the house of the lord of hosts their god
former the blessing of god shall reward their labour in building gods
promise to zorobabel
in the four and twentieth day of the month in the sixth month in
the second year of darius the king they began
and in the seventh month the word of the lord came by the hand of
speak to zorobabel the son of salathiel the governor of juda and
to jesus the son of josedec the high priest and to the rest of the
people saying
who is left among you that saw this house in its first glory and
how do you see it now is it not in comparison to that as nothing in
your eyes
yet now take courage o zorobabel saith the lord and take
courage jesus the son of josedec the high priest and take courage all
ye people of the land saith the lord of hosts and perform for i am
with you saith the lord of hosts
the word that i convenanted with you when you came out of the land
of egypt and my spirit shall be in the midst of you fear not
for thus saith the lord of hosts yet one little while and i will
move the heaven and the earth and the sea and the dry land
and i will move all nations and the desired of all nations shall
the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the lord of hosts
great shall be the glory of this last house more than of the
first saith the lord of hosts and in this place i will give peace
saith the lord of hosts
in the four and twentieth day of the ninth month in the second
year of darius the king the word of the lord came to aggeus the
prophet saying
thus saith the lord of hosts ask the priests the law saying
if a man carry sanctified flesh in the skirt of his garment and
touch with his skirt bread or pottage or wine or oil or any meat
shall it be sanctified and the priests answered and said no
and aggeus said if one that is unclean by occasion of a soul
touch any of all these things shall it be defiled and the priests
answered and said it shall be defiled
case according to the prescription of the law num a person
not only became unclean himself but made every thing that he touched
unclean the prophet applies all this to the people whose souls
remained unclean by neglecting the temple of god and therefore were not
sanctified by the flesh they offered in sacrifice but rather defiled
their sacrifices by approaching to them in the state of uncleanness
and aggeus answered and said so is this people and so is this
nation before my face saith the lord and so is all the work of their
hands and all that they have offered there shall be defiled
and now consider in your hearts from this day and upward before
there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of the lord
when you went to a heap of twenty bushels and they became ten
and you went into the press to press out fifty vessels and they became
twenty
i struck you with a blasting wind and all the works of your hand
with the mildew and with hail yet there was none among you that
returned to me saith the lord
set your hearts from this day and henceforward from the four and
twentieth day of the ninth month from the day that the foundations of
the temple of the lord were laid and lay it up in your hearts
is the seed as yet sprung up or hath the vine and the fig tree
and the pomegranate and the olive tree as yet flourished from this day
and the word of the lord came a second time to aggeus in the four
and twentieth day of the month saying
speak to zorobabel the governor of juda saying i will move both
heaven and earth
and i will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and will destroy the
strength of the kingdom of the gentiles and i will overthrow the
chariot and him that rideth therein and the horses and their riders
shall come down every one by the sword of his brother
in that day saith the lord of hosts i will take thee o
make thee as a signet for i have chosen thee saith the lord of hosts
the race of zorobabel
same occasion his prophecy is full of mysterious figures and promises
of blessings partly relating to the synagogue and partly to the church
of christ
