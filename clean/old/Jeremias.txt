encourages him
the words of jeremias the son of helcias of the priests that were
in anathoth in the land of benjamin
the word of the lord which came to him in the days of josias the
son of amon king of juda in the thirteenth year of his reign
and which came to him in the days of joakim the son of josias king
of juda unto the end of the eleventh year of sedecias the son of josias
king of juda even unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the
fifth month
and the word of the lord came to me saying
before i formed thee in the bowels of thy mother i knew thee and
before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and made
thee a prophet unto the nations
and i said ah ah ah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am
a child
and the lord said to me say not i am a child for thou shalt go
to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i shall command thee thou
shalt speak
be not afraid at their presence for i am with thee to deliver
thee saith the lord
and the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord
said to me behold i have given my words in thy mouth
lo i have set thee this day over the nations and over kingdoms
to root up and to pull down and to waste and to destroy and to
build and to plant
and the word of the lord came to me saying what seest thou
and the lord said to me thou hast seen well for i will watch
over my word to perform it
and the word of the lord came to me a second time saying what
seest thou and i said i see a boiling caldron and the face thereof
from the face of the north
and the lord said to me from the north shall an evil break forth
upon all the inhabitants of the land
for behold i will call together all the families of the kingdoms
of the north saith the lord and they shall come and shall set every
one his throne in the entrance of the gates of jerusalem and upon all
the walls thereof round about and upon all the cities of juda
and i will pronounce my judgments against them touching all their
wickedness who have forsaken me and have sacrificed to strange gods
and have adored the work of their own hands
thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak to them all
that i command thee be not afraid at their presence for i will make
thee not to fear their countenance
for behold i have made thee this day a fortified city and a
pillar of iron and a wall of brass over all the land to the kings of
the land
and they shall fight against them and shall not prevail for i am
with thee saith the lord to deliver thee
and the word of the lord came to me saying
go and cry in the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord
espousals when thou followedst me in the desert in a land that is not
sown
israel is holy to the lord the firstfruits of his increase all
they that devour him offend evils shall come upon them saith the lord
hear ye the word of the lord o house of jacob and all ye families
of the house of israel
thus saith the lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me
that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are
become vain
and they have not said where is the lord that made us come up out
of the land of egypt that led us through the desert through a land
uninhabited and unpassable through a land of drought and the image of
death through a land wherein no man walked nor any man dwelt
and i brought you into the land of carmel to eat the fruit
thereof and the best things thereof and when ye entered in you
defiled my land and made my inheritance an abomination
the priests did not say where is the lord and they that held the
law knew me not and the pastors transgressed against me and the
prophets prophesied in baal and followed idols
therefore will i yet contend in judgment with you saith the lord
and i will plead with your children
pass over to the isles of cethim and see and send into cedar
and consider diligently and see if there hath been done any thing like
this
if a nation hath changed their gods and indeed they are not gods
but my people have changed their glory into an idol
be astonished o ye heavens at this and ye gates thereof be
very desolate saith the lord
for my people have done two evils they have forsaken me the
fountain of living water and have digged to themselves cisterns broken
cisterns that can hold no water
is israel a bondman or a homeborn slave why then is he become a
prey
the lions have roared upon him and have made a noise they have
made his land a wilderness his cities are burnt down and there is none
to dwell in them
the children also of memphis and of taphnes have defloured thee
even to the crown of the head
hath not this been done to thee because thou hast forsaken the
and now what hast thou to do in the way of egypt to drink the
troubled water and what hast thou to do with the way of the assyrians
to drink the water of the river
thy own wickedness shall reprove thee and thy apostasy shall
rebuke thee know thou and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing
for thee to have left the lord thy god and that my fear is not with
thee saith the lord the god of hosts
of old time thou hast broken my yoke thou hast burst my bands
and thou saidst i will not serve for on every high hill and under
every green tree thou didst prostitute thyself
yet i planted thee a chosen vineyard all true seed how then art
thou turned unto me into that which is good for nothing o strange
vineyard
though thou wash thyself with nitre and multiply to thyself the
herb borith thou art stained in thy iniquity before me saith the lord
how canst thou say i am not polluted i have not walked after
runner pursuing his course
a wild ass accustomed to the wilderness in the desire of his
heart snuffed up the wind of his love none shall turn her away all
that seek her shall not fail in her monthly filth they shall find her
keep thy foot from being bare and thy throat from thirst but
thou saidst i have lost all hope i will not do it for i have loved
strangers and i will walk after them
as the thief is confounded when he is taken so is the house of
priests and their prophets
saying to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hast
begotten me they have turned their back to me and not their face and
in the time of their affliction they will say arise and deliver us
where are the gods whom thou hast made thee let them arise and
deliver thee in the time of thy affliction for according to the number
of thy cities were thy gods o juda
why will you contend with me in judgment you have all forsaken
me saith the lord
in vain have i struck your children they have not received
correction your sword hath devoured your prophets your generation is
like a ravaging lion
see ye the word of the lord am i become a wilderness to israel
or a lateward springing land why then have my people said we are
revolted we will come to thee no more
will a virgin forget her ornament or a bride her stomacher but
my people hath forgotten me days without number
why dost thou endeavour to shew thy way good to seek my love thou
who hast also taught thy malices to be thy ways
and in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor and
innocent not in ditches have i found them but in all places which i
mentioned before
and thou hast said i am without sin and am innocent and
therefore let thy anger be turned away from me behold i will contend
with thee in judgment because thou hast said i have not sinned
how exceeding base art thou become going the same ways over
again and thou shalt be ashamed of egypt as thou wast ashamed of
for from thence thou shalt go and thy hand shall be upon thy
head for the lord hath destroyed thy trust and thou shalt have nothing
prosperous therein
them he foretells the conversion of the gentiles
it is commonly said if a man put away his wife and she go from
him and marry another man shall he return to her any more shall not
that woman be polluted and defiled but thou hast prostituted thyself
to many lovers nevertheless return to me saith the lord and i will
receive thee
lift up thy eyes on high and see where thou hast not prostituted
thyself thou didst sit in the ways waiting for them as a robber in the
wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications and
with thy wickedness
therefore the showers were withholden and there was no lateward
rain thou hadst a harlots forehead thou wouldst not blush
therefore at the least from this time call to me thou art my
father the guide of my virginity
wilt thou be angry for ever or wilt thou continue unto the end
and the lord said to me in the days of king josias hast thou seen
what rebellious israel hath done she hath gone of herself upon every
high mountain and under every green tree and hath played the harlot
there
and when she had done all these things i said return to me and
she did not return and her treacherous sister juda saw
that because the rebellious israel had played the harlot i had put
her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister
and by the facility of her fornication she defiled the land and
played the harlot with stones and with stocks
and after all this her treacherous sister juda hath not returned
to me with her whole heart but with falsehood saith the lord
and the lord said to me the rebellious israel hath justified her
soul in comparison of the treacherous juda
go and proclaim these words towards the north and thou shalt
say return o rebellious israel saith the lord and i will not turn
away my face from you for i am holy saith the lord and i will not be
angry for ever
but yet acknowledge thy iniquity that thou hast transgressed
against the lord thy god and thou hast scattered thy ways to strangers
under every green tree and hast not heard my voice saith the lord
return o ye revolting children saith the lord for i am your i
husband and i will take you one of a city and two of a kindred and
will bring you into sion
and i will give you pastors according to my own heart and they
shall feed you with knowledge and doctrine
and when you shall be multiplied and increase in the land in
those days saith the lord they shall say no more the ark of the
covenant of the lord neither shall it come upon the heart neither
shall they remember it neither shall it be visited neither shall that
be done any more
at that time jerusalem shall be called the throne of the lord and
all the nations shall be gathered together to it in the name of the
most wicked heart
in those days the house of juda shall go to the house of israel
and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land
which i gave to your fathers
but i said how shall i put thee among the children and give thee
a lovely land the goodly inheritance of the armies of the gentiles and
but as a woman that despiseth her lover so hath the house of
a voice was heard in the highways weeping and howling of the
children of israel because they have made their way wicked they have
forgotten the lord their god
return you rebellious children and i will heal your rebellions
in very deed the hills were liars and the multitude of the
mountains truly in the lord our god is the salvation of israel
confusion hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth
their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters
we shall sleep in our confusion and our shame shall cover us
because we have sinned against the lord our god we and our fathers from
our youth even to this day and we have not hearkened to the voice of
the lord our god
with threats of grievous punishment to those that persist in sin
if thou wilt return o israel saith the lord return to me if
thou wilt take away thy stumblingblocks out of my sight thou shalt not
be moved
and thou shalt swear as the lord liveth in truth and in
judgment and in justice and the gentiles shall bless him and shall
praise him
for thus saith the lord to the men of juda and jerusalem break up
anew your fallow ground and sow not upon thorns
be circumcised to the lord and take away the foreskins of your
hearts ye men of juda and ye inhabitants of jerusalem lest my
indignation come forth like fire and burn and there be none that can
quench it because of the wickedness of your thoughts
declare ye in juda and make it heard in jerusalem speak and
sound with the trumpet in the land cry aloud and say assemble
yourselves and let us go into strong cities
set up the standard in sion strengthen yourselves stay not for i
bring evil from the north and great destruction
the lion is come up out of his den and the robber of nations hath
roused himself he is come forth out of his place to make thy land
desolate thy cities shall be laid waste remaining without an
inhabitant
for this gird yourselves with haircloth lament and howl for the
fierce anger of the lord is not turned away from us
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that the
heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the
priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall be amazed
and i said alas alas alas o lord god hast thou then deceived
this people and jerusalem saying you shall have peace and behold the
sword reacheth even to the soul
at that time it shall be said to this people and to jerusalem a
burning wind is in the ways that are in the desert of the way of the
daughter of my people not to fan nor to cleanse
a full wind from these places shall come to me and now i will
speak my judgments with them
behold he shall come up as a cloud and his chariots as a tempest
his horses are swifter than eagles woe unto us for we are laid waste
wash thy heart from wickedness o jerusalem that thou mayst be
saved how long shall hurtful thoughts abide in thee
for a voice of one declaring from dan and giving notice of the
idol from mount ephraim
say ye to the nations behold it is heard in jerusalem that
guards are coming from a far country and give out their voice against
the cities of juda
they are set round about her as keepers of fields because she
hath provoked me to wrath saith the lord
thy ways and thy devices have brought these things upon thee
this is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it hath touched
thy heart
my bowels my bowels are in part the senses of my heart are
troubled within me i will not hold my peace for my soul hath heard the
sound of the trumpet the cry of battle
destruction upon destruction is called for and all the earth is
laid waste my tents are destroyed on a sudden and my pavilions in a
moment
how long shall i see men fleeing away how long shall i hear the
sound of the trumpet
for my foolish people have not known me they are foolish and
senseless children they are wise to do evil but to do good they have
no knowledge
i beheld the earth and lo it was void and nothing and the
heavens and there was no light in them
i looked upon the mountains and behold they trembled and all the
hills were troubled
i beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the air
were gone
i looked and behold carmel was a wilderness and all its cities
were destroyed at the presence of the lord and at the presence of the
wrath of his indignation
for thus saith the lord all the land shall be desolate but yet i
will not utterly destroy
the earth shall mourn and the heavens shall lament from above
because i have spoken i have purposed and i have not repented neither
am i turned away from it
at the voice of the horsemen and the archers all the city is
fled away they have entered into thickets and climbed up the rocks all
the cities are forsaken and there dwelleth not a man in them
but when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do though thou clothest
thyself with scarlet though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold
and paintest thy eyes with stibic stone thou shalt dress thyself out in
vain thy lovers have despised thee they will seek thy life
for i have heard the voice as of a woman in travail anguishes as
of a woman in labour of a child the voice of the daughter of sion
dying away spreading her hands woe is me for my soul hath fainted
because of them that are slain
go about through the streets of jerusalem and see and consider
and seek in the broad places thereof if you can find a man that
executeth judgment and seeketh faith and i will be merciful unto it
and though they say the lord liveth this also they will swear
falsely
o lord thy eyes are upon truth thou hast struck them and they
have not grieved thou hast bruised them and they have refused to
receive correction they have made their faces harder than the rock and
they have refused to return
but i said perhaps these are poor and foolish that know not the
way of the lord the judgment of their god
i will go therefore to the great men and will speak to them for
they have known the way of the lord the judgment of their god and
behold these have altogether broken the yoke more and have burst the
bonds
wherefore a lion out of the wood hath slain them a wolf in the
evening hath spoiled them a leopard watcheth for their cities every
one that shall go out thence shall be taken because their
transgressions are multiplied their rebellions are strengthened
how can i be merciful to thee thy children have forsaken me and
swear by them that are not gods i fed them to the full and they
committed adultery and rioted in the harlots house
they are become as amorous horses and stallions every one neighed
after his neighbours wife
shall i not visit for these things saith the lord and shall not
my soul take revenge on such a nation
scale the walls thereof and throw them down but do not utterly
destroy take away the branches thereof because they are not the
for the house of israel and the house of juda have greatly
transgressed against me saith the lord
they have denied the lord and said it is not he and the evil
shall not come upon us we shall not see the sword and famine
the prophets have spoken in the wind and there was no word of god
in them these things therefore shall befall them
thus saith the lord the god of hosts because you have spoken this
word behold i will make my words in thy mouth as fire and this people
as wood and it shall devour them
behold i will bring upon you a nation from afar o house of
whose language thou shalt not know nor understand what they say
their quiver is as an open sepulchre they are all valiant
and they shall eat up thy corn and thy bread they shall devour
thy sons and thy daughters they shall eat up thy flocks and thy
herds they shall eat thy vineyards and thy figs and with the sword
they shall destroy thy strong cities wherein thou trustest
nevertheless in those days saith the lord i will not bring you
to utter destruction
and if you shall say why hath the lord our god done all these
things to us thou shalt say to them as you have forsaken me and
served a strange god in your own land so shall you serve strangers in a
land that is not your own
declare ye this to the house of jacob and publish it in juda
saying
hear o foolish people and without understanding who have eyes
and see not and ears and hear not
will not you then fear me saith the lord and will you not repent
at my presence i have set the sand a bound for the sea an everlasting
ordinance which it shall not pass over and the waves thereof shall
toss themselves and shall not prevail they shall swell and shall not
pass over it
but the heart of this people is become hard of belief and
provoking they are revolted and gone away
and they have not said in their heart let us fear the lord our
preserveth for us the fulness of the yearly harvest
your iniquities have turned these things away and your sins have
withholden good things from you
for among my people are found wicked men that lie in wait as
fowlers setting snares and traps to catch men
as a net is full of birds so their houses are full of deceit
therefore are they become great and enriched
they are grown gross and fat and have most wickedly transgressed
my words they have not judged the cause of the widow they have not
managed the cause of the fatherless and they have not judged the
judgment of the poor
shall i not visit for these things saith the lord or shall not
my soul take revenge on such a nation
astonishing and wonderful things have been done in the land
the prophets prophesied falsehood and the priests clapped their
hands and my people loved such things what then shall be done in the
end thereof
the good way and not to rely on sacrifices without obedience
strengthen yourselves ye sons of benjamin in the midst of
i have likened the daughter of sion to a beautiful and delicate
woman
the shepherds shall come to her with their flocks they have
pitched their tents against her round about every one shall feed them
that are under his hand
prepare ye war against her arise and let us go up at midday woe
unto us for the day is declined for the shadows of the evening are
grown longer
arise and let us go up in the night and destroy her houses
for thus saith the lord of hosts hew down her trees cast up a
trench about jerusalem this is the city to be visited all oppression
is in the midst of her
as a cistern maketh its water cold so hath she made her wickedness
cold violence and spoil shall be heard in her infirmity and stripes
are continually before me
be thou instructed o jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee
lest i make thee desolate a land uninhabited
thus saith the lord of hosts they shall gather the remains of
grapegatherer into the basket
to whom shall i speak and to whom shall i testify that he may
hear behold their ears are uncircumcised and they cannot hear behold
the word of the lord is become unto them a reproach and they will not
receive it
therefore am i full of the fury of the lord i am weary with
holding in pour it out upon the child abroad and upon the council of
the young men together for man and woman shall be taken the ancient
and he that is full of days
and their houses shall be turned over to others with their lands
and their wives together for i will stretch forth my hand upon the
inhabitants of the land saith the lord
for from the least of them even to the greatest all are given to
covetousness and from the prophet even to the priest all are guilty of
deceit
and they healed the breach of the daughter of my people
disgracefully saying peace peace and there was no peace
they were confounded because they committed abomination yea
rather they were not confounded with confusion and they knew not how to
blush wherefore they shall fall among them that fall in the time of
their visitation they shall fall down saith the lord
thus saith the lord stand ye on the ways and see and ask for
the old paths which is the good way and walk ye in it and you shall
find refreshment for your souls and they said we will not walk
and i appointed watchmen over you saying hearken ye to the sound
of the trumpet and they said we will not hearken
therefore hear ye nations and know o congregation what great
things i will do to them
hear o earth behold i will bring evils upon this people the
fruits of their own thoughts because they have not heard my words and
they have cast away my law
to what purpose do you bring me frankincense from saba and the
sweet smelling cane from a far country your holocausts are not
acceptable nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring destruction
upon this people by which fathers and sons together shall fall
neighbour and kinsman shall perish
thus saith the lord behold a people cometh from the land of the
north and a great nation shall rise up from the ends of the earth
they shall lay hold on arrow and shield they are cruel and will
have no mercy their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall mount
upon horses prepared as men for war against thee o daughter of sion
we have heard the fame thereof our hands grow feeble anguish
hath taken hold of us as a woman in labour
go not out into the fields nor walk in the highway for the sword
of the enemy and fear is on every side
gird thee with sackcloth o daughter of my people and sprinkle
thee with ashes make thee mourning as for an only son a bitter
lamentation because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us
i have set thee for a strong trier among my people and thou shalt
know and prove their way
all these princes go out of the way they walk deceitfully they
are brass and iron they are all corrupted
the bellows have failed the lead is consumed in the fire the
founder hath melted in vain for their wicked deeds are not consumed
call them reprobate silver for the lord hath rejected them
conversion the lord will not receive the prayers of the prophet for
them because they are obstinate in their sins
the word that came to jeremias from the lord saying
stand in the gate of the house of the lord and proclaim there this
word and say hear ye the word of the lord all ye men of juda that
enter in at these gates to adore the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel make your ways and
your doings good and i will dwell with you in this place
trust not in lying words saying the temple of the lord the
temple of the lord it is the temple of the lord
for if you will order well your ways and your doings if you will
execute judgment between a man and his neighbour
if you oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and
shed not innocent blood in this place and walk not after strange gods
to your own hurt
i will dwell with you in this place in the land which i gave to
your fathers from the beginning and for evermore
behold you put your trust in lying words which shall not profit
you
to steal to murder to commit adultery to swear falsely to offer
to baalim and to go after strange gods which you know not
and you have come and stood before me in this house in which my
name is called upon and have said we are delivered because we have
done all these abominations
is this house then in which my name hath been called upon in
your eyes become a den of robbers i i am he i have seen it saith the
go ye to my place in silo where my name dwelt from the beginning
and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel
and now because you have done all these works saith the lord
and i have spoken to you rising up early and speaking and you have not
heard and i have called you and you have not answered
i will do to this house in which my name is called upon and in
which you trust and to the place which i have given you and your
fathers as i did to silo
and i will cast you away from before my face as i have cast away
all your brethren the whole seed of ephraim
therefore do not thou pray for this people nor take to thee
praise and supplication for them and do not withstand me for i will
not hear thee
seest thou not what they do in the cities of juda and in the
streets of jerusalem
the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the
women knead the dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to
offer libations to strange gods and to provoke me to anger
name
do they provoke me to anger saith the lord is it not themselves
to the confusion of their own countenance
therefore thus saith the lord god behold my wrath and my
indignation is enkindled against this place upon men and upon beasts
and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruits of the land and it
shall burn and shall not be quenched
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel add your burnt
offerings to your sacrifices and eat ye the flesh
for i spoke not to your fathers and i commanded them not in the
day that i brought them out of the land of egypt concerning the matter
of burnt offerings and sacrifices
offered without obedience which was the thing principally commanded
so that in comparison with it the offering of the holocausts and
sacrifices was of small account
but this thing i commanded them saying hearken to my voice and
way that i have commanded you that it may be well with you
but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in
their own will and in the perversity of their wicked heart and went
backward and not forward
from the day that their fathers came out of the land of egypt
even to this day and i have sent to you all my servants the prophets
from day to day rising up early and sending
and they have not hearkened to me nor inclined their ear but
have hardened their neck and have done worse than their fathers
and thou shalt speak to them all these words but they will not
hearken to thee and thou shalt call them but they will not answer
thee
and thou shalt say to them this is a nation which hath not
hearkened to the voice of the lord their god nor received instruction
faith is lost and is taken away out of their mouth
cut off thy hair and cast it away and take up a lamentation on
high for the lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his
wrath
because the children of juda have done evil in my eyes saith the
called upon to pollute it
and they have built the high places of topheth which is in the
valley of the son of ennom to burn their sons and their daughters in
the fire which i commanded not nor thought on in my heart
therefore behold the days shall come saith the lord and it shall
no more be called topheth nor the valley of the son of ennom but the
valley of slaughter and they shall bury in topheth because there is no
place
and the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of
the air and for the beasts of the earth and there shall be none to
drive them away
and i will cause to cease out of the cities of juda and out of
the streets of jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness
the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land
shall be desolate
at that time saith the lord they shall cast out the bones of the
kings of juda and the bones of the princes thereof and the bones of
the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the
inhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves
and they shall spread them abroad to the sun and the moon and all
the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and
after whom have walked and whom they have sought and adored they
shall not be gathered and they shall not be buried they shall be as
dung upon the face of the earth
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all that shall remain
of this wicked kindred in all places which are left to which i have
cast them out saith the lord of hosts
and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord shall not he that
falleth rise again and he that is turned away shall he not turn
again
why then is this people in jerusalem turned away with a stubborn
revolting they have laid hold on lying and have refused to return
i attended and hearkened no man speaketh what is good there is
none that doth penance for his sin saying what have i done they are
all turned to their own course as a horse rushing to the battle
the kite in the air hath known her time the turtle and the
swallow and the stork have observed the time of their coming but my
people have not known the judgment of the lord
how do you say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us
the wise men are confounded they are dismayed and taken for they
have cast away the word of the lord and there is no wisdom in them
therefore will i give their women to strangers their fields to
others for an inheritance because from the least even to the greatest
all follow covetousness from the prophet even to the priest all deal
deceitfully
and they healed the breach of the daughter of my people
disgracefully saying peace peace when there was no peace
they are confounded because they have committed abomination yea
rather they are not confounded with confusion and they have not known
how to blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the
time of their visitation they shall fall saith the lord
gathering i will gather them together saith the lord there is no
grape on the vines and there are no figs on the fig tree the leaf is
fallen and i have given them the things that are passed away
why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into
the fenced city and let us be silent there for the lord our god hath
put us to silence and hath given us water of gall to drink for we have
sinned against the lord
we looked for peace and no good came for a time of healing and
behold fear
the snorting of his horses was heard from dan all the land was
moved at the sound of the neighing of his warriors and they came and
devoured the land and all that was in it the city and its inhabitants
for behold i will send among you serpents basilisks against
which there is no charm and they shall bite you saith the lord
my sorrow is above sorrow my heart mourneth within me
behold the voice of the daughter of my people from a far country
provoked me to wrath with their idols and strange vanities
the harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not saved
for the affliction of the daughter of my people i am afflicted
and made sorrowful astonishment hath taken hold on me
is there no balm in galaad or is there no physician there why
then is not the wound of the daughter of my people closed
are the cause of them he exhorts them to repentance
who will give water to my head and a fountain of tears to my eyes
and i will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my
people
who will give me in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring
men and i will leave my people and depart from them because they are
all adulterers an assembly of transgressors
and they have bent their tongue as a bow for lies and not for
truth they have strengthened themselves upon the earth for they have
proceeded from evil to evil and me they have not known saith the lord
let every man take heed of his neighbour and let him not trust in
any brother of his for every brother will utterly supplant and every
friend will walk deceitfully
and a man shall mock his brother and they will not speak the
truth for they have taught their tongue to speak lies they have
laboured to commit iniquity
thy habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they have
refused to know me saith the lord
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will melt and try
them for what else shall i do before the daughter of my people
their tongue is a piercing arrow it hath spoken deceit with his
mouth one speaketh peace with his friend and secretly he lieth in wait
for him
shall i not visit them for these things saith the lord or shall
not my soul be revenged on such a nation
for the mountains i will take up weeping and lamentation and for
the beautiful places of the desert mourning because they are burnt up
for that there is not a man that passeth through them and they have not
heard the voice of the owner from the fowl of the air to the beasts
they are gone away and departed
and i will make jerusalem to be heaps of sand and dens of
dragons and i will make the cities of juda desolate for want of an
inhabitant
who is the wise man that may understand this and to whom the
word of the mouth of the lord may come that he may declare this why the
land hath perished and is burnt up like a wilderness which none
passeth through
and the lord said because they have forsaken my law which i gave
them and have not heard my voice and have not walked in it
but they have gone after the perverseness of their own heart and
after baalim which their fathers taught them
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i
will feed this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to
drink
and i will scatter them among the nations which they and their
fathers have not known and i will send the sword after them till they
be consumed
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel consider ye and
call for the mourning women and let them come and send to them that
are wise women and let them make haste
let them hasten and take up a lamentation for us let our eyes
shed tears and our eyelids run down with waters
for a voice of wailing is heard out of sion how are we wasted and
greatly confounded because we have left the land because our dwellings
are cast down
hear therefore ye women the word of the lord and let your ears
receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and
every one her neighbour mourning
for death is come up through our windows it is entered into our
houses to destroy the children from without the young men from the
streets
speak thus saith the lord even the carcass of man shall fall as
dung upon the face of the country and as grass behind the back of the
mower and there is none to gather it
thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom and
let not the strong man glory in his strength and let not the rich man
glory in his riches
but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and
knoweth me for i am the lord that exercise mercy and judgment and
justice in the earth for these things please me saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord and i will visit upon every
one that hath the foreskin circumcised
upon egypt and upon juda and upon edom and upon the children of
that dwell in the desert for all the nations are uncircumcised in the
flesh but all the house of israel are uncircumcised in the heart
things the chastisement of jerusalem for her sins
hear ye the word which the lord hath spoken concerning you o
house of israel
thus saith the lord learn not according to the ways of the
fear
for the laws of the people are vain for the works of the hand of
the workman hath cut a tree out of the forest with an axe
he hath decked it with silver and gold he hath put it together
with nails and hammers that it may not fall asunder
they are framed after the likeness of a palm tree and shall not
speak they must be carried to be removed because they cannot go
there is none like to thee o lord thou art great and great is
thy name in might
who shall not fear thee o king of nations for thine is the
glory among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms
there is none like unto thee
they shall be all proved together to be senseless and foolish the
doctrine of their vanity is wood
silver spread into plates is brought from tharsis and gold from
violet and purple is their clothing all these things are the work of
artificers
but the lord is the true god he is the living god and the
everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations
shall not be able to abide his threatening
thus then shall you say to them the gods that have not made
heaven and earth let them perish from the earth and from among those
places that are under heaven
he that maketh the earth by his power that prepareth the world
by his wisdom and stretcheth out the heavens by his knowledge
at his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the heaven and
lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings
for rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures
every man is become a fool for knowledge every artist is
confounded in his graven idol for what he hath cast is false and there
is no spirit in them
they are vain things and a ridiculous work in the time of their
visitation they shall perish
the portion of jacob is not like these for it is he who formed
all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of hosts
is his name
gather up thy shame out of the land thou that dwellest in a
siege
for thus saith he lord behold i will cast away far off the
inhabitants of the land at this time and i will afflict them so that
they may be found
woe is me for my destruction my wound is very grievous but i
said truly this is my own evil and i will bear it
my tabernacle is laid waste all my cords are broken my children
are gone out from me and they are not there is none to stretch forth
my tent any more and to set up my curtains
because the pastors have done foolishly and have not sought the
scattered
behold the sound of a noise cometh a great commotion out of the
land of the north to make the cities of juda a desert and a dwelling
for dragons
i know o lord that the way of a man is not his neither is it
in a man to walk and to direct his steps
mans free will yet he can do no good without gods help nor evil
without his permission so that in the present case all the evils
which nabuchodonosor was about to bring upon jerusalem could not have
come but by the will of god
correct me o lord but yet with judgment and not in thy fury
lest thou bring me to nothing
pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not known
thee and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy name because
they have eaten up jacob and devoured him and consumed him and have
destroyed his glory
obstinate transgressors of it the conspiracy of the jews against him a
figure of their conspiracy against christ
the word that came from the lord to jeremias saying
hear ye the words of this covenant and speak to the men of juda
and to the inhabitants of jerusalem
and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord the god of israel
which i commanded your fathers in the day that i brought them out
of the land of egypt from the iron furnace saying hear ye my voice
and do all things that i command you and you shall be my people and i
will be your god
that i may accomplish the oath which i swore to your fathers to
give them a land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day and i
answered and said amen o lord
and the lord said to me proclaim aloud all these words in the
cities of juda and in the streets of jerusalem saying hear ye the
words of the covenant and do them
for protesting i conjured your fathers in the day that i brought
them out of the land of egypt even to this day rising early i conjured
them and said hearken ye to my voice
and they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every one
in the perverseness of his own wicked heart and i brought upon them all
the words of this covenant which i commanded them to do but they did
them not
and the lord said to me a conspiracy is found among the men of
they are returned to the former iniquities of their fathers who
refused to hear my words so these likewise have gone after strange
gods to serve them the house of israel and the house of juda have
made void my covenant which i made with their fathers
wherefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring in evils upon
them which they shall not be able to escape and they shall cry to me
and i will not hearken to them
and the cities of juda and the inhabitants of jerusalem shall
go and cry to the gods to whom they offer sacrifice and they shall not
save them in the time of their affliction
for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods o juda
and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem thou hast set up
altars of confusion altars to offer sacrifice to baalim
therefore do not thou pray for this people and do not take up
praise and prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time of
their cry to me in the time of their affliction
what is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought much wickedness
in my house shall the holy flesh take away from thee thy crimes in
which thou hast boasted
the lord called thy name a plentiful olive tree fair fruitful
and beautiful at the noise of a word a great fire was kindled in it
and the branches thereof are burnt
and the lord of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evil
against thee for the evils of the house of israel and of the house of
sacrifice to baalim
but thou o lord hast shewn me and i have known then thou
shewedst me their doings
and i was as a meek lamb that is carried to be a victim and i
knew not that they had devised counsels against me saying let us put
wood on his bread and cut him off from the land of the living and let
his name be remembered no more
but thou o lord of sabaoth who judgest justly and triest the
reins and the hearts let me see thy revenge on them for to thee have i
revealed my cause
in the scripturesibid thy revenge this was rather a prediction of
what was to happen with an approbation of the divine justice than an
imprecation
therefore thus saith the lord to the men of anathoth who seek
thy life and say thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the lord and
thou shalt not die in our hands
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will visit upon
them their young men shall die by the sword their sons and their
daughters shall die by famine
and there shall be no remains of them for i will bring in evil
upon the men of anathoth the year of their visitation
desolation of the jews for their sins their return from their
captivity
thou indeed o lord art just if i plead with thee but yet i
will speak what is just to thee why doth the way of the wicked prosper
why is it well with all them that transgress and do wickedly
thou hast planted them and they have taken root they prosper and
bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their
reins
and thou o lord hast known me thou hast seen me and proved my
heart with thee gather them together as for the day of slaughter
how long shall the land mourn and the herb of every field wither
for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts and the birds
are consumed because they have said he shall not see our last end
if thou hast been wearied with running with footmen how canst
thou contend with horses and if thou hast been secure in a land of
peace what wilt thou do in the swelling of the jordan
for even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they have
fought against thee and have cried after thee with full voice believe
them not when they speak good things to thee
i have forsaken my house i have left my inheritance i have given
my dear soul into the hand of her enemies
my inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood it hath
cried out against me therefore have i hated it
is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird is it as a bird dyed
throughout come ye assemble yourselves all ye beasts of the earth
make haste to devour
many pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my
portion under foot they have changed my delightful portion into a
desolate wilderness
they have laid it waste and it hath mourned for me with
desolation is all the land made desolate because there is none that
considereth in the heart
the spoilers are come upon all the ways of the wilderness for
the sword of the lord shall devour from one end of the land to the other
end thereof there is no peace for all flesh
they have sown wheat and reaped thorns they have received an
inheritance and it shall not profit them you shall be ashamed of your
fruits because of the fierce wrath of the lord
thus saith the lord against all wicked neighbours that touch the
inheritance that i have shared out to my people israel behold i will
pluck them out of their land and i will pluck the house of juda out of
the midst of them
and when i shall have plucked them out i will return and have
mercy on them and will bring them back every man to his inheritance
and every man into his land
and it shall come to pass if they will be taught and will learn
the ways of my people to swear by my name the lord liveth as they
have taught my people to swear by baal that they shall be built up in
the midst of my people
but if they will not hear i will utterly pluck out and destroy
that nation saith the lord
thus saith the lord to me go and get thee a linen girdle and
thou shalt put it about thy loins and shalt not put it into water
and i got a girdle according to the word of the lord and put it
about my loins
and the word of the lord came to me the second time saying
take the girdle which thou hast got which is about thy loins and
arise go to the euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock
and i went and hid it by the euphrates as the lord had commanded
me
and it came to pass after many days that the lord said to me
commanded thee to hide there
and i went to the euphrates and digged and took the girdle out
of the place where i had hid it and behold the girdle was rotten so
that it was fit for no use
and the word of the lord came to me saying
thus saith the lord after this manner will i make the pride of
this wicked people that will not hear my words and that walk in
the perverseness of their heart and have gone after strange gods to
serve them and to adore them and they shall be as this girdle which
is fit for no use
for as the girdle sticketh close to the loins of a man so have i
brought close to me all the house of israel and all the house of juda
saith the lord that they might be my people and for a name and for a
praise and for a glory but they would not hear
thou shalt speak therefore to them this word thus saith the lord
the god of israel every bottle shall be filled with wine and they
shall say to thee do we not know that every bottle shall be filled with
wine
and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord behold i will
fill all the inhabitants of this land and the kings of the race of
all the inhabitants of jerusalem with drunkenness
and i will scatter them every man from his brother and fathers
and sons in like manner saith the lord i will not spare and i will
not pardon nor will i have mercy but to destroy them
hear ye and give ear be not proud for the lord hath spoken
give ye glory to the lord your god before it be dark and before
your feet stumble upon the dark mountains you shall look for light and
he will turn it into the shadow of death and into darkness
but if you will not hear this my soul shall weep in secret for
your pride weeping it shall weep and my eyes shall run down with
tears because the flock of the lord is carried away captive
say to the king and to the queen humble yourselves sit down
for the crown of your glory is come down from your head
the cities of the south are shut up and there is none to open
them all juda is carried away captive with an entire captivity
lift up your eyes and see you that come from the north where
is the flock that is given thee thy beautiful cattle
what wilt thou say when he shall visit thee for thou hast taught
them against thee and instructed them against thy own head shall not
sorrows lay hold on thee as a woman in labour
and if thou shalt say in thy heart why are these things come
upon me for the greatness of thy iniquity thy nakedness is discovered
the soles of thy feet are defiled
if the ethiopian can change his skin or the leopard his spots
you also may do well when you have learned evil
and i will scatter them as stubble which is carried away by the
wind in the desert
this is thy lot and the portion of thy measure from me saith
the lord because thou hast forgotten me and hast trusted in falsehood
wherefore i have also bared thy thighs against thy face and thy
shame hath appeared
i have seen thy adulteries and thy neighing the wickedness of
thy fornication and thy abominations upon the hills in the field woe
to thee jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean after me how long yet
denounced to false prophets the prophet mourns for his people
the word of the lord that came to jeremias concerning the words of
the drought
judea hath mourned and the gates thereof are fallen and are
become obscure on the ground and the cry of jerusalem is gone up
the great ones sent their inferiors to the water they came to
draw they found no water they carried back their vessels empty they
were confounded and afflicted and covered their heads
for the destruction of the land because there came no rain upon
the earth the husbandman were confounded they covered their heads
yea the hind also brought forth in the field and left it
because there was no grass
and the wild asses stood upon the rocks they snuffed up the wind
like dragons their eyes failed because there was no grass
if our iniquities have testified against us o lord do thou it
for thy names sake for our rebellions are many we have sinned against
thee
o expectation of israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble
why wilt thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man
turning in to lodge
why wilt thou be as a wandering man as a mighty man that cannot
save but thou o lord art among us and thy name is called upon by us
forsake us not
thus saith the lord to this people that have loved to move their
feet and have not rested and have not pleased the lord he will now
remember their iniquities and visit their sins
and the lord said to me pray not for this people for their good
when they fast i will not hear their prayers and if they offer
holocausts and victims i will not receive them for i will consume them
by the sword and by famine and by the pestilence
and i said ah ah ah o lord god the prophets say to them you
shall not see the sword and there shall be no famine among you but he
will give you true peace in this place
and the lord said to me the prophets prophesy falsely in my
name i sent them not neither have i commanded them nor have i spoken
to them they prophesy unto you a lying vision and divination and
deceit and the seduction of their own heart
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that
prophesy in my name whom i did not send that say sword and famine
shall not be in this land by sword and famine shall those prophets be
consumed
and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and there
shall be none to bury them they and their wives their sons and their
daughters and i will pour out their own wickedness upon them
and thou shalt speak this word to them let my eyes shed down
tears night and day and let them not cease because the virgin daughter
of my people is afflicted with a great affliction with an exceeding
grievous evil
if i go forth into the fields behold the slain with the sword
and if i enter into the city behold them that are consumed with famine
not
hast thou utterly cast away juda or hath thy soul abhorred sion
why then hast thou struck us so that there is no healing for us we
have looked for peace and there is no good and for the time of
healing and behold trouble
we acknowledge o lord our wickedness the iniquities of our
fathers because we have sinned against thee
give us not to be a reproach for thy names sake and do not
disgrace in us the throne of thy glory remember break not thy covenant
with us
are there any among the graven things of the gentiles that can
send rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou the lord our
complaint and gods promise to him
and the lord said to me if moses and samuel shall stand before
me my soul is not towards this people cast them out from my sight and
let them go forth
and if they shall say unto thee whither shall we go forth thou
shalt say to them thus saith the lord such as are for death to death
and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are for famine
to famine and such as are for captivity to captivity
and i will visit them with four kinds saith the lord the sword
to kill and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the air and the beasts
of the earth to devour and to destroy
and i will give them up to the rage of all the kingdoms of the
earth because of manasses the son of ezechias the king of juda for all
that he did in jerusalem
for who shall have pity on thee o jerusalem or who shall bemoan
thee or who shall go to pray for thy peace
thou hast forsaken me saith the lord thou art gone backward and
weary of entreating thee
and i will scatter them with a fan in the gates of the land i
have killed and destroyed my people and yet they are not returned from
their ways
their widows are multiplied unto me above the sand of the sea i
have brought upon them against the mother of the young man a spoiler at
noonday i have cast a terror on a sudden upon the cities
she that hath borne seven is become weak her soul hath fainted
away her sun is gone down while it was yet day she is confounded and
ashamed and the residue of them i will give up to the sword in the
sight of their enemies saith the lord
woe is me my mother why hast thou borne me a man of strife a
man of contention to all the earth i have not lent on usury neither
hath any man lent to me on usury yet all curse me
the lord saith to me assuredly it shall be well with thy
remnant assuredly i shall help thee in the time of affliction and in
the time of tribulation against the enemy
shall iron be allied with the iron from the north and the brass
or enter into an alliance upon equal footing with it no certainly but
it must be broken by it
thy riches and thy treasures i will give unto spoil for nothing
because of all thy sins even in all thy borders
and i will bring thy enemies out of a land which thou knowest
not for a fire is kindled in my rage it shall burn upon you
o lord thou knowest remember me and visit me and defend me
from them that persecute me do not defend me in thy patience know that
for thy sake i have suffered reproach
longsuffering which thou usest towards sinners keep thee from making
haste to my assistance
thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was to me
a joy and gladness of my heart for thy name is called upon me o lord
i sat not in the assembly of jesters nor did i make a boast of
the presence of thy hand i sat alone because thou hast filled me with
threats
why is my sorrow become perpetual and my wound desperate so as
to refuse to be healed it is become to me as the falsehood of deceitful
waters that cannot be trusted
therefore thus saith the lord if thou wilt be converted i will
convert thee and thou shalt stand before my face and thou wilt
separate the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth they
shall be turned to thee and thou shalt not be turned to them
and i will make thee to this people as a strong wall of brass
and they shall fight against thee and shall not prevail for i am with
thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the lord
and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and i will
redeem thee out of the hand of the mighty
their idolatry but shall at length be released from their captivity
and the gentiles shall be converted
and the word of the lord came to me saying
thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons and
daughters in this place
for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and daughters that
are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bore them and
concerning their fathers of whom they were born in this land
they shall die by the death of grievous illnesses they shall not
be lamented and they shall not be buried they shall be as dung upon
the face of the earth and they shall be consumed with the sword and
with famine and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of the air
and for the beasts of the earth
for thus saith the lord enter not into the house of feasting
neither go thou to mourn nor to comfort them because i have taken away
my peace from this people saith the lord my mercy and commiserations
both the great and the little shall die in this land they shall
not be buried nor lamented and men shall not cut themselves nor make
themselves bald for them
and they shall not break bread among them to him that mourneth to
comfort him for the dead neither shall they give them for their father
and mother
and do not thou go into the house of feasting to sit with them
and to eat and drink
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will
take away out of this place in your sight and in your days the voice of
mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the
voice of the bride
and when thou shalt tell this people all these words and they
shall say to thee wherefore hath the lord pronounced against us all
this great evil what is our iniquity and what is our sin that we have
sinned against the lord our god
thou shalt say to them because your fathers forsook me saith
the lord and went after strange gods and served them and adored them
and they forsook me and kept not my law
and you also have done worse than your fathers for behold every
one of you walketh after the perverseness of his evil heart so as not
to hearken to me
so i will cast you forth out of this land into a land which you
know not nor your fathers and there you shall serve strange gods day
and night which shall not give you any rest
therefore behold the days come saith the lord when it shall be
said no more the lord liveth that brought forth the children of israel
out of the land of egypt
but the lord liveth that brought the children of israel out of
the land of the north and out of all the lands to which i cast them
out and i will bring them again into their land which i gave to their
fathers
behold i will send many fishers saith the lord and they shall
fish them and after this i will send them many hunters and they shall
hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes
of the rocks
for my eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my
face and their iniquity hath not been hid from my eyes
and i will repay first their double iniquities and their sins
because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their idols and
they have filled my inheritance with their abominations
o lord my might and my strength and my refuge in the day of
tribulation to thee the gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth
and shall say surely our fathers have possessed lies a vanity which
hath not profited them
shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods
therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will shew
them my hand and my power and they shall know that my name is the lord
that trusteth in flesh god alone searcheth the heart giving to every
one as he deserves the prophet prayeth to be delivered from his
enemies and preacheth up the observance of the sabbath
the sin of juda is written with a pen of iron with the point of a
diamond it is graven upon the table of their heart upon the horns of
their altars
when their children shall remember their altars and their groves
and their green trees upon the high mountains
sacrificing in the field i will give thy strength and all thy
treasures to the spoil and thy high places for sin in all thy borders
and thou shalt be left stripped of thy inheritance which i gave
thee and i will make thee serve thy enemies in a land which thou
knowest not because thou hast kindled a fire in my wrath it shall burn
for ever
thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and
maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord
for he shall be like tamaric in the desert and he shall not see
when good shall come but he shall dwell in dryness in the desert in a
salt land and not inhabited
wilderness
blessed be the man that trusteth in the lord and the lord shall
be his confidence
and he shall be as a tree that is planted by the waters that
spreadeth out its roots towards moisture and it shall not fear when the
heat cometh and the leaf thereof shall be green and in the time of
drought it shall not be solicitous neither shall it cease at any time
to bring forth fruit
the heart is perverse above all things and unsearchable who can
know it
i am the lord who search the heart and prove the reins who give
to every one according to his way and according to the fruit of his
devices
as the partridge hath hatched eggs which she did not lay so is
he that hath gathered riches and not by right in the midst of his days
he shall leave them and in his latter end he shall be a fool
a high and glorious throne from the beginning is the place of our
sanctification
o lord the hope of israel all that forsake thee shall be
confounded they that depart from thee shall be written in the earth
because they have forsaken the lord the vein of living waters
heal me o lord and i shall be healed save me and i shall be
saved for thou art my praise
behold they say to me where is the word of the lord let it
come
and i am not troubled following thee for my pastor and i have
not desired the day of man thou knowest that which went out of my
lips hath been right in thy sight
be not thou a terror unto me thou art my hope in the day of
affliction
let them be confounded that persecute me and let not me be
confounded let them be afraid and let not me be afraid bring upon
them the day of affliction and with a double destruction destroy them
of the prophets are not to be understood as imprecations proceeding
from malice or desire of revenge but as prophetic predictions of evils
that were about to fall upon impenitent sinners and approbations of the
ways of divine justice
thus saith the lord to me go and stand in the gate of the
children of the people by which the kings of juda come in and go out
and in all the gates of jerusalem
and thou shalt say to them hear the word of the lord ye kings
of juda and al juda and all the inhabitants of jerusalem that enter
in by these gates
thus saith the lord take heed to your souls and carry no
burdens on the sabbath day and bring them not in by the gates of
and do not bring burdens out of your houses on the sabbath day
neither do ye any work sanctify the sabbath day as i commanded your
fathers
but they did not hear nor incline their ear but hardened their
neck that they might not hear me and might not receive instruction
and it shall come to pass if you will hearken to me saith the
day and if you will sanctify the sabbath day to do no work therein
then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and
princes sitting upon the throne of david and riding in chariots and on
horses they and their princes the men of juda and the inhabitants of
and they shall come from the cities of juda and from the places
round about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the
plains and from the mountains and from the south bringing holocausts
and victims and sacrifices and frankincense and they shall bring in
an offering into the house of the lord
but if you will not hearken to me to sanctify the sabbath day
and not to carry burdens and not to bring them in by the gates of
and it shall devour the houses of jerusalem and it shall not be
quenched
pardoneth penitents and punisheth the obstinate they conspire against
them
the word that came to jeremias from the lord saying
arise and go down into the potters house and there thou shalt
hear my words
and i went down into the potters house and behold he was doing a
work on the wheel
and the vessel was broken which he was making of clay with his
hands and turning he made another vessel as it seemed good in his eyes
to make it
then the word of the lord came to me saying
cannot i do with you as this potter o house of israel saith the
hand o house of israel
i will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom to
root out and to pull down and to destroy it
if that nation against which i have spoken shall repent of their
evil i also will repent of the evil that i have thought to do to them
and i will suddenly speak of a nation and of a kingdom to build
up and plant it
if it shall do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice i
will repent of the good that i have spoken to do unto it
now therefore tell the men of juda and the inhabitants of
and devise a device against you let every man of you return from his
evil way and make ye your ways and your doings good
and they said we have no hopes for we will go after our own
thoughts and we will do every one according to the perverseness of his
evil heart
therefore thus saith the lord ask among the nations who hath
heard such horrible things as the virgin of israel hath done to excess
shall the snow of libanus fail from the rock of the field or can
the cold waters that gush out and run down be taken away
because my people have forgotten me sacrificing in vain and
stumbling in their ways in ancient paths to walk by them in a way not
trodden
that their land might be given up to desolation and to a
perpetual hissing every one that shall pass by it shall be astonished
and wag his head
as a burning wind will i scatter them before the enemy i will
shew them the back and not the face in the day of their destruction
and they said come and let us invent devices against jeremias
for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise
nor the word from the prophet come and let us strike him with the
tongue and let us give no heed to all his words
give heed to me o lord and hear the voice of my adversaries
shall evil be rendered for good because they have digged a pit
for my soul remember that i have stood in thy sight to speak good for
them and to turn away thy indignation from them
the jews and prophetically denouncing the evils that should fall upon
them in punishment of their crimes
therefore deliver up their children to famine and bring them
into the hands of the sword let their wives be bereaved of children and
widows and let their husbands be slain by death let their young men be
stabbed with the sword in battle
let a cry be heard out of their houses for thou shalt bring the
robber upon them suddenly because they have digged a pit to take me
and have hid snares for my feet
but thou o lord knowest all their counsel against me unto
death not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from thy
sight let them be overthrown before thy eyes in the time of thy wrath
do thou destroy them
the desolation of the jews for their sins
thus saith the lord go and take a potters earthen bottle and
take of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of the priests
and go forth into the valley of the son of ennom which is by the
entry of the earthen gate and there thou shalt proclaim the words that
and thou shalt say hear the word of the lord o ye kings of juda
and ye inhabitants of jerusalem thus saith the lord of hosts the god
of israel behold i will bring an affliction upon this place so that
whosoever shall hear it his ears shall tingle
because they have forsaken me and have profaned this place and
have sacrificed therein to strange gods whom neither they nor their
fathers knew nor the kings of juda and they have filled this place
with the blood of innocents
and they have built the high places of baalim to burn their
children with fire for a holocaust to baalim which i did not command
nor speak of neither did it once come into my mind
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that this place
shall no more be called topheth nor the valley of the son of ennom but
the valley of slaughter
and i will defeat the counsel of juda and of jerusalem in this
place and i will destroy them with the sword in the sight of their
enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and i will give
their carcasses to be meat for the fowls of the air and for the beasts
of the earth
and i will make this city an astonishment and a hissing every
one that shall pass by it shall be astonished and shall hiss because
of all the plagues thereof
and i will feed them with the flesh of their sons and with the
flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of his
friend in the siege and in the distress wherewith their enemies and
they that seek their lives shall straiten them
and thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men that
shall go with thee
and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord of hosts even so
will i break this people and this city as the potters vessel is
broken which cannot be made whole again and they shall be buried in
thus will i do to this place saith the lord and to the
inhabitants thereof and i will make this city as topheth
and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of juda
shall be unclean as the place of topheth all the houses upon whose
roofs they have sacrificed to all the host of heaven and have poured
out drink offerings to strange gods
then jeremias came from topheth whither the lord had sent him to
prophesy and he stood in the court of the house of the lord and said
to all the people
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will
bring in upon this city and upon all the cities thereof all the evils
that i have spoken against it because they have hardened their necks
that they might not hear my words
and bemoans himself
now phassur the son of emmer the priest who was appointed chief
in the house of the lord heard jeremias prophesying these words
and phassur struck jeremias the prophet and put him in the
stocks that were in the upper gate of benjamin in the house of the
and when it was light the next day phassur brought jeremias out
of the stocks and jeremias said to him the lord hath not called thy
name phassur but fear on every side
is here changed to magormissabib or fear on every side to denote the
evils that should come upon him in punishment of his opposing the word
of god
for thus saith the lord behold i will deliver thee up to fear
thee and all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of their
enemies and thy eyes shall see it and i will give all juda into the
hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry them away to babylon
and shall strike them with the sword
and i will give all the substance of this city and all its
labour and every precious thing thereof and all the treasures of the
kings of juda will i give into the hands of their enemies and they
shall pillage them and take them away and carry them to babylon
but thou phassur and all that dwell in thy house shall go into
captivity and thou shalt go to babylon and there thou shalt die and
there thou shalt be buried thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast
prophesied a lie
thou hast deceived me o lord and i am deceived thou hast been
stronger than i and thou hast prevailed i am become a laughingstock
all the day all scoff at me
concealing from him when he accepted of the prophetical commission the
greatness of the evils which the execution of that commission was to
bring upon him
for i am speaking now this long time crying out against iniquity
and i often proclaim devastation and the word of the lord is made a
reproach to me and a derision all the day
then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in
his name and there came in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my
bones and i was wearied not being able to bear it
for i heard the reproaches of many and terror on every side
familiars and continued at my side if by any means he may be deceived
and we may prevail against him and be revenged on him
but the lord is with me as a strong warrior therefore they that
persecute me shall fall and shall be weak they shall be greatly
confounded because they have not understood the everlasting reproach
which never shall be effaced
and thou o lord of hosts prover of the just who seest the
reins and the heart let me see i beseech thee thy vengeance on them
for to thee i have laid open my cause
but zeal of justice
sing ye to the lord praise the lord because he hath delivered
the soul of the poor out of the hand of the wicked
cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day in which my
mother bore me be blessed
prophet there is a certain figure of speech to express with more energy
the greatness of the evils to which his birth had exposed him
cursed be the man that brought the tidings to my father saying
let that man be as the cities which the lord hath overthrown and
hath not repented let him hear a cry in the morning and howling at
noontide
who slew me not from the womb that my mother might have been my
grave and her womb an everlasting conception
why came i out of the womb to see labour and sorrow and that my
days should be spent in confusion
besieged
the word that came to jeremias from the lord when king sedecias
sent unto him phassur the son of melchias and sophonias the son of
inquire of the lord for us for nabuchodonosor king of babylon
maketh war against us if so be the lord will deal with us according to
all his wonderful works that he may depart from us
and jeremias said to them thus shall you say to sedecias
thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will turn back
the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you fight
against the king of babylon and the chaldeans that besiege you round
about the walls and i will gather them together in the midst of this
city
and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and
with a strong arm and in fury and in indignation and in great wrath
and i will strike the inhabitants of this city men and beasts
shall die of a great pestilence
and after this saith the lord i will give sedecias the king of
city from the pestilence and the sword and the famine into the hand
of nabuchodonosor the king of babylon and into the hand of their
enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and he shall
strike them with the edge of the sword and he shall not be moved to
pity nor spare them nor shew mercy to them
and to this people thou shalt say thus saith the lord behold i
set before you the way of life and the way of death
he that shall abide in this city shall die by the sword and by
the famine and by the pestilence but he that shall go out and flee
over to the chaldeans that besiege you shall live and his life shall
be to him as a spoil
for i have set my face against this city for evil and not for
good saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of
and to the house of the king of juda hear ye the word of the
o house of david thus saith the lord judge ye judgment in the
morning and deliver him that is oppressed by violence out of the hand
of the oppressor lest my indignation go forth like a fire and be
kindled and there be none to quench it because of the evil of your
ways
behold i come to thee that dwellest in a valley upon a rock above
a plain saith the lord and you say who shall strike us and who shall
enter into our houses
strength of her situation upon rocks surrounded with a deep valley
but i will visit upon you according to the fruit of your doings
saith the lord and i will kindle a fire in the forest thereof and it
shall devour all things round about it
thus saith the lord go down to the house of the king of juda and
there thou shalt speak this word
than those of the foregoing chapter for the order of time is not always
observed in the writings of the prophets
and thou shalt say hear the word of the lord king of juda that
sittest upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people
who enter in by these gates
thus saith the lord execute judgment and justice and deliver him
that is oppressed out of the hand of the oppressor and afflict not the
stranger the fatherless and the widow nor oppress them unjustly and
shed not innocent blood in this place
for if you will do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by
the gates of this house kings of the race of david sitting upon his
throne and riding in chariots and on horses they and their servants
and their people
but if you will not hearken to these words i swear by myself
saith the lord that this house shall become a desolation
for thus saith the lord to the house of the king of juda thou art
to me galaad the head of libanus yet surely i will make thee a
wilderness and cities not habitable
here signified the royal palace of the kings of the house of david by
and i will prepare against thee the destroyer and his weapons and
they shall cut down thy chosen cedars and shall cast them headlong into
the fire
and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every
man to his neighbour why hath the lord done so to this great city
and they shall answer because they have forsaken the covenant of
the lord their god and have adored strange gods and served them
weep not for him that is dead nor bemoan him with your tears
lament him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his
native country
by death was taken away so as not to see the miseries of his country
carried captive into egypt
for thus saith the lord to sellum the son of josias the king of
place he shall return hither no more
but in the place to which i have removed him there shall he
die and he shall not see this land any more
woe to him that buildeth up his house by injustice and his
chambers not in judgment that will oppress his friend without cause
and will not pay him his wages
who saith i will build me a wide house and large chambers who
openeth to himself windows and maketh roofs of cedar and painteth them
with vermilion
shalt thou reign because thou comparest thyself to the cedar
did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and it
was then well with him
he judged the cause of the poor and needy for his own good was
it not therefore because he knew me saith the lord
but thy eyes and thy heart are set upon covetousness and upon
shedding innocent blood and upon oppression and running after evil
works
therefore thus saith the lord concerning joakim the son of josias
king of juda they shall not mourn for him alas my brother and alas
sister they shall not lament for him alas my lord or alas the
noble one
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass rotten and cast
forth without the gates of jerusalem
go up to libanus and cry and lift up thy voice in basan and
cry to them that pass by for all thy lovers are destroyed
i spoke to thee in thy prosperity and thou saidst i will not
hear this hath been thy way from thy youth because thou hast not heard
my voice
the wind shall feed all thy pastors and thy lovers shall go into
captivity and then shalt thou be confounded and ashamed of all thy
wickedness
thou that sittest in libanus and makest thy nest in the cedars
how hast thou mourned when sorrows came upon thee as the pains of a
woman in labour
as i live saith the lord if jechonias the son of joakim the
king of juda were a ring on my right hand i would pluck him thence
and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life
and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest and into the hand of
and i will send thee and thy mother that bore thee into a
strange country in which you were not born and there you shall die
and they shall not return into the land whereunto they lift up
their mind to return thither
is this man jechonias an earthen and a broken vessel is he a
vessel wherein is no pleasure why are they cast out he and his seed
and are cast into a land which they know not
o earth earth earth hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord write this man barren a man that shall not
prosper in his days for there shall not be a man of his seed that shall
sit upon the throne of david and have power any more in juda
children but that his children should never sit on the throne of juda
prophets preaching without being sent
woe to the pastors that destroy and tear the sheep of my pasture
saith the lord
therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel to the pastors
that feed my people you have scattered my flock and driven them away
and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you for the evil of
your doings saith the lord
and i will gather together the remnant of my flock out of all the
lands into which i have cast them out and i will make them return to
their own fields and they shall increase and be multiplied
and i will set up pastors over them and they shall feed them
they shall fear no more and they shall not be dismayed and none shall
be wanting of their number saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord and i will raise up to david
a just branch and a king shall reign and shall be wise and shall
execute judgment and justice in the earth
in those days shall juda be saved and israel shall dwell
confidently and this is the name that they shall call him the lord our
just one
therefore behold the days come saith the lord and they shall say
no more the lord liveth who brought up the children of israel out of
the land of egypt
but the lord liveth who hath brought out and brought hither the
seed of the house of israel from the land of the north and out of all
the lands to which i had cast them forth and they shall dwell in their
own land
to the prophets my heart is broken within me all my bones
tremble i am become as a drunken man and as a man full of wine at the
presence of the lord and at the presence of his holy words
because the land is full of adulterers because the land hath
mourned by reason of cursing the fields of the desert are dried up and
their course is become evil and their strength unlike
for the prophet and the priest are defiled and in my house i
have found their wickedness saith the lord
therefore their way shall be as a slippery way in the dark for
they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bring evils upon
them the year of their visitation saith the lord
and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria they prophesied
in baal and deceived my people israel
and i have seen the likeness of adulterers and the way of lying
in the prophets of jerusalem and they strengthened the hands of the
wicked that no man should return from his evil doings they are all
become unto me as sodom and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrha
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts to the prophets behold i
will feed them with wormwood and will give them gall to drink for from
the prophets of jerusalem corruption is gone forth into all the land
thus saith the lord of hosts hearken not to the words of the
prophets that prophesy to you and deceive you they speak a vision of
their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord
they say to them that blaspheme me the lord hath said you shall
have peace and to every one that walketh in the perverseness of his own
heart they have said no evil shall come upon you
for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath seen and
heard his word who hath considered his word and heard it
behold the whirlwind of the lords indignation shall come forth
and a tempest shall break out and come upon the head of the wicked
the wrath of the lord shall not return till he execute it and
till he accomplish the thought of his heart in the latter days you
shall understand his counsel
i did not send prophets yet they ran i have not spoken to them
yet they prophesied
if they had stood in my counsel and had made my words known to
my people i should have turned them from their evil way and from their
wicked doings
am i think ye a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar
off
shall a man be hid in secret places and i not see him saith the
i have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my
name and say i have dreamed i have dreamed
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy
lies and that prophesy the delusions of their own heart
who seek to make my people forget my name through their dreams
which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers forgot my
name for baal
the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that
hath my word let him speak my word with truth what hath the chaff to
do with the wheat saith the lord
are not my words as a fire saith the lord and as a hammer that
breaketh the rock in pieces
therefore behold i am against the prophets saith the lord who
steal my words every one from his neighbour
behold i am against the prophets saith the lord who use their
tongues and say the lord saith it
behold i am against the prophets that have lying dreams saith
the lord and tell them and cause my people to err by their lying and
by their wonders when i sent them not nor commanded them who have not
profited this people at all saith the lord
if therefore this people or the prophet or the priest shall ask
thee saying what is the burden of the lord thou shalt say to them
and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall
say the burden of the lord i will visit upon that man and upon his
house
at least for those times because it was then used in mockery and
contempt by the false prophets and unbelieving people who ridiculed
the repeated threats of jeremias under the name of his burdens
thus shall you say every one to his neighbour and to his
brother what hath the lord answered and what hath the lord spoken
and the burden of the lord shall be mentioned no more for every
mans word shall be his burden for you have perverted the words of the
living god of the lord of hosts our god
thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answered
thee and what hath the lord spoken
but if you shall say the burden of the lord therefore thus
saith the lord because you have said this word the burden of the lord
and i have sent to you saying say not the burden of the lord
therefore behold i will take you away carrying you and will
forsake you and the city which i gave to you and to your fathers out
of my presence
presence he will cast them and bring them to captivity for their
transgressions
and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a
perpetual shame which shall never be forgotten
desolation of those that were left behind
the lord shewed me and behold two baskets full of figs set
before the temple of the lord after that nabuchodonosor king of babylon
had carried away jechonias the son of joakim the king of juda and his
chief men and the craftsmen and engravers of jerusalem and had
brought them to babylon
one basket had very good figs like the figs of the first season
and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten
because they were bad
and the lord said to me what seest thou jeremias and i said
be eaten because they are bad
and the word of the lord came to me saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel like these good figs so
will i regard the captives of juda whom i have sent forth out of this
place into the land of the chaldeans for their good
and i will set my eyes upon them to be pacified and i will bring
them again into this land and i will build them up and not pull them
down and i will plant them and not pluck them up
and i will give them a heart to know me that i am the lord and
they shall be my people and i will be their god because they shall
return to me with their whole heart
and as the very bad figs that cannot be eaten because they are
bad thus saith the lord so will i give sedecias the king of juda and
his princes and the residue of jerusalem that have remained in this
city and that dwell in the land of egypt
and i will deliver them up to vexation and affliction to all the
kingdoms of the earth to be a reproach and a byword and a proverb
and to be a curse in all places to which i have cast them out
and i will send among them the sword and the famine and the
pestilence till they be consumed out of the land which i gave to them
and their fathers
destruction of babylon and other nations
the word that came to jeremias concerning all the people of juda
in the fourth year of joakim the son of josias king of juda the same
is the first year of nabuchodonosor king of babylon
which jeremias the prophet spoke to all the people of juda and to
all the inhabitants of jerusalem saying
from the thirteenth year of josias the son of ammon king of juda
until this day this is the three and twentieth year the word of the
speaking and you have not hearkened
and the lord hath sent to you all his servants the prophets
rising early and sending and you have not hearkened nor inclined your
ears to hear
when he said return ye every one from his evil way and from
your wicked devices and you shall dwell in the land which the lord hath
given to you and your fathers for ever and ever
and go not after strange gods to serve them and adore them nor
provoke me to wrath by the works of your hands and i will not afflict
you
and you have not heard me saith the lord that you might provoke
me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts because you have not heard
my words
behold i will send and take all the kindreds of the north saith
the lord and nabuchodonosor the king of babylon my servant and i will
bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and
against all the nations that are round about it and i will destroy
them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and perpetual
desolations
his instrument in punishing the sins of his people
and i will take away from them the voice of mirth and the voice
of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride
the sound of the mill and the light of the lamp
and all this land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and
all these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years
and when the seventy years shall be expired i will punish the
king of babylon and that nation saith the lord for their iniquity
and the land of the chaldeans and i will make it perpetual desolations
and i will bring upon that land all my words that i have spoken
against it all that is written in this book all that jeremias hath
prophesied against all nations
for they have served them whereas they were many nations and
great kings and i will repay them according to their deeds and
according to the works of their hands
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take the cup
of wine of this fury at my hand and thou shalt make all the nations to
drink thereof into which i shall send thee
and they shall drink and be troubled and be mad because of the
sword which i shall send among them
and i took the cup at the hand of the lord and i presented it to
all the nations to drink of it to which the lord sent me
to wit jerusalem and the cities of juda and the kings thereof
and the princes thereof to make them a desolation and an astonishment
and a hissing and a curse as it is at this day
pharao the king of egypt and his servants and his princes and
all his people
and all in general all the kings of the land of ausitis and all
the kings of the land of the philistines and ascalon and gaza and
and edom and moab and the children of ammon
and all the kings of tyre and all the kings of sidon and the
kings of the land of the islands that are beyond the sea
and dedan and thema and buz and all that have their hair cut
round
and all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the west that
dwell in the desert
and all the kings of zambri and all the kings of elam and all
the kings of the medes
and all the kings of the north far and near every one against
his brother and all the kingdoms of the earth which are upon the face
thereof and the king of sesac shall drink after them
people under her yoke should quickly fall and be destroyed herself
and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord of hosts the god
of israel drink ye and be drunken and vomit and fall and rise no
more because of the sword which i shall send among you
and if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink thou
shalt say to them thus saith the lord of hosts drinking you shall
drink
for behold i begin to bring evil on the city wherein my name is
called upon and shall you be as innocent and escape free you shall
not escape free for i will call for the sword upon all the inhabitants
of the earth saith the lord of hosts
and thou shalt prophesy unto them all these words and thou shalt
say to them i the lord shall roar from on high and shall utter his
voice from his holy habitation roaring he shall roar upon the place of
his beauty the shout as it were of them that tread grapes shall be
given out against all the inhabitants of the earth
the noise is come even to the ends of the earth for the lord
entereth into judgment with the nations he entereth into judgment with
all flesh the wicked i have delivered up to the sword saith the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts behold evil shall go forth from
nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall go forth from the ends of
the earth
and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of
the earth even to the other end thereof they shall not be lamented and
they shall not be gathered up nor buried they shall lie as dung upon
the face of the earth
howl ye shepherds and cry and sprinkle yourselves with ashes
ye leaders of the flock for the days of your slaughter and your
dispersion are accomplished and you shall fall like precious vessels
and the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the leaders of
the flock to save themselves
a voice of the cry of the shepherds and a howling of the
principal of the flock because the lord hath wasted their pastures
and the fields of peace have been silent because of the fierce
anger of the lord
he hath forsaken his covert as the lion for the land is laid
waste because of the wrath of the dove and because of the fierce anger
of the lord
military standard it is said was a dove but the hebrew word jonah
which is here rendered a dove may also signify a waster or oppressor
which name better agrees to that unmerciful prince or by comparison as
a doves flight is the swiftest so would their destruction come upon
them
the princes
in the beginning of the reign of joakim the son of josias king of
thus saith the lord stand in the court of the house of the lord
and speak to all the cities of juda out of which they come to adore in
the house of the lord all the words which i have commanded thee to
speak unto them leave not out one word
if so be they will hearken and be converted every one from his
evil way that i may repent me of the evil that i think to do unto them
for the wickedness of their doings
and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord if you will not
hearken to me to walk in my law which i have given you
to give ear to the words of my servants the prophets whom i sent
to you rising up early and sending and you have not hearkened
i will make this house like silo and i will make this city a
curse to all the nations of the earth
and the priests and the prophets and all the people heard
and when jeremias had made an end of speaking all that the lord
had commanded him to speak to all the people the priests and the
prophets and all the people laid hold on him saying let him be put to
death
why hath he prophesied in the name of the lord saying this house
shall be like silo and this city shall be made desolate without an
inhabitant and all the people were gathered together against jeremias
in the house of the lord
and the princes of juda heard these words and they went up from
the kings house into the house of the lord and sat in the entry of the
new gate of the house of the lord
and the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all
the people saying the judgment of death is for this man because he
hath prophesied against this city as you have heard with your ears
then jeremias spoke to all the princes and to all the people
saying the lord sent me to prophesy concerning this house and
concerning this city all the words that you have heard
now therefore amend your ways and your doings and hearken to
the voice of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evil
that he hath spoken against you
but as for me behold i am in your hands do with me what is good
and right in your eyes
but know ye and understand that if you put me to death you
will shed innocent blood against your own selves and against this city
and the inhabitants thereof for in truth the lord sent me to you to
speak all these words in your hearing
then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to
the prophets there is no judgment of death for this man for he hath
spoken to us in the name of the lord our god
and some of the ancients of the land rose up and they spoke to
all the assembly of the people saying
micheas of morasthi was a prophet in the days of ezechias king of
be a heap of stones and the mountain of the house the high places of
woods
did ezechias king of juda and all juda condemn him to death
did they not fear the lord and beseech the face of the lord and the
are doing a great evil against our souls
there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the lord
city and against this land according to all the words of jeremias
and joakim and all his men in power and his princes heard these
words and the king sought to put him to death and urias heard it and
was afraid and fled and went into egypt
and king joakim sent men into egypt elnathan the son of achobor
and men with him into egypt
and they brought urias out of egypt and brought him to king
the graves of the common people
so the hand of ahicam the son of saphan was with jeremias that
he should not be delivered into the hands of the people to put him to
death
their necks under the yoke of the king of babylon the vessels of the
temple shall not be brought back till all the rest are carried away
in the beginning of the reign of joakim the son of josias king of
the reign of joakim but the bands were not sent to the princes here
named before the reign of sedecias ver
thus saith the lord to me make thee bands and chains and thou
shalt put them on thy neck
and thou shalt send them to the king of edom and to the king of
and to the king of sidon by the hand of the messengers that are come to
and thou shalt command them to speak to their masters thus saith
the lord of hosts the god of israel thus shall you say to your masters
i made the earth and the men and the beasts that are upon the
face of the earth by my great power and by my stretched out arm and i
have given it to whom it seemed good in my eyes
and now i have given all these lands into the hand of
the field i have given him to serve him
and all nations shall serve him and his son and his sons son
till the time come for his land and himself and many nations and great
kings shall serve him
but the nation and kingdom that will not serve nabuchodonosor king
of babylon and whosoever will not bend his neck under the yoke of the
king of babylon i will visit upon that nation with the sword and with
famine and with pestilence saith the lord till i consume them by his
hand
therefore hearken not to your prophets and diviners and
dreamers and soothsayers and sorcerers that say to you you shall not
serve the king of babylon
for they prophesy lies to you to remove you far from your
country and cast you out and to make you perish
but the nation that shall bend down their neck under the yoke of
the king of babylon and shall serve him i will let them remain in
their own land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell in it
and i spoke to sedecias the king of juda according to all these
words saying bend down your necks under the yoke of the king of
why will you die thou and thy people by the sword and by
famine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken against the
nation that will not serve the king of babylon
hearken not to the words of the prophets that say to you you
shall not serve the king of babylon for they tell you a lie
for i have not sent them saith the lord and they prophesy in my
name falsely to drive you out and that you may perish both you and
the prophets that prophesy to you
i spoke also to the priests and to this people saying thus
saith the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy
to you saying behold the vessels of the lord shall now in a short time
be brought again from babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you
therefore hearken not to them but serve the king of babylon
that you may live why should this city be given up to desolation
but if they be prophets and the word of the lord be in them let
them interpose themselves before the lord of hosts that the vessels
which were left in the house of the lord and in the house of the king
of juda and in jerusalem may not go to babylon
for thus saith the lord of hosts to the pillars and to the sea
and to the bases and to the rest of the vessels that remain in this
city
which nabuchodonosor the king of babylon did not take when he
carried away jechonias the son of joakim the king of juda from
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel to the
vessels that are left in the house of the lord and in the house of the
king of juda and jerusalem
they shall be carried to babylon and there they shall be until
the day of their visitation saith the lord and i will cause them to be
brought and to be restored in this place
foretold
and it came to pass in that year in the beginning of the reign of
of the lord before the priests and all the people saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have broken the
yoke of the king of babylon
as yet two years of days and i will cause all the vessels of the
house of the lord to be brought back into this place which
them to babylon
and i will bring back to this place jechonias the son of joakim
king of juda and all the captives of juda that are gone to babylon
saith the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon
and jeremias the prophet said to hananias the prophet in the
presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that
stood in the house of the lord
and jeremias the prophet said amen the lord do so the lord
perform thy words which thou hast prophesied that the vessels may be
brought again into the house of the lord and all the captives may
return out of babylon to this place
nevertheless hear this word that i speak in thy ears and in the
ears of all the people
the prophets that have been before me and before thee from the
beginning and have prophesied concerning many countries and concerning
great kingdoms of war and of affliction and of famine
the prophet that prophesied peace when his word shall come to
pass the prophet shall be known whom the hath sent in truth
and hananias the prophet took the chain from the neck of jeremias
the prophet and broke it
and hananias spoke in the presence of all the people saying
king of babylon after two full years from off the neck of all the
nations
and jeremias the prophet went his way and the word of the lord
came to jeremias after that hananias the prophet had broken the chain
from off the neck of jeremias the prophet saying
go and tell hananias thus saith the lord thou hast broken
chains of wood and thou shalt make for them chains of iron
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have put a
yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations to serve nabuchodonosor
king of babylon and they shall serve him moreover also i have given
him the beasts of the earth
and jeremias the prophet said to hananias the prophet hear now
trust in a lie
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will send thee away from
off the face of the earth this year shalt thou die for thou hast
spoken against the lord
and hananias the prophet died in that year in the seventh month
there and not to hearken to false prophets that they shall be
delivered after seventy years but those that remain in jerusalem shall
perish by the sword famine and pestilence and that achab sedecias
and semeias false prophets shall die miserably
now these are the words of the letter which jeremias the prophet
sent from jerusalem to the residue of the ancients that were carried
into captivity and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the
people whom nabuchodonosor had carried away from jerusalem to babylon
after that jechonias the king and the queen and the eunuchs and
the princes of juda and of jerusalem and the craftsmen and the
engravers were departed out of jerusalem
by the hand of elasa the son of saphan and gamarias the son of
king of babylon saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel to all that are
carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away from
build ye houses and dwell in them and plant orchards and eat
the fruit of them
take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for
your sons and give your daughters to husbands and let them bear sons
and daughters and be ye multiplied there and be not few in number
and seek the peace of the city to which i have caused you to be
carried away captives and pray to the lord for it for in the peace
thereof shall be your peace
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your
prophets that are in the midst of you and your diviners deceive you
and give no heed to your dreams which you dream
for they prophesy falsely to you in my name and i have not sent
them saith the lord
for thus saith the lord when the seventy years shall begin to be
accomplished in babylon i will visit you and i will perform my good
word in your favour to bring you again to this place
for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord
thoughts of peace and not of affliction to give you an end and
patience
and you shall call upon me and you shall go and you shall pray
to me and i will hear you
you shall seek me and shall find me when you shall seek me with
all your heart
and i will be found by you saith the lord and i will bring back
your captivity and i will gather you out of all nations and from all
the places to which i have driven you out saith the lord and i will
bring you back from the place to which i caused you to be carried away
captive
because you have said the lord hath raised us up prophets in
for thus saith the lord to the king that sitteth upon the throne
of david and to all the people that dwell in this city to your
brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity
thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will send upon them the
sword and the famine and the pestilence and i will make them like bad
figs that cannot be eaten because they are very bad
and i will persecute them with the sword and with famine and
with the pestilence and i will give them up unto affliction to all the
kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and a
hissing and a reproach to all the nations to which i have driven them
out
because they have not hearkened to my words saith the lord
which i sent to them by my servants the prophets rising by night and
sending and you have not heard saith the lord
hear ye therefore the word of the lord all ye of the captivity
whom i have sent out from jerusalem to babylon
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel to achab the son
of colias and to sedecias the son of maasias who prophesy unto you in
my name falsely behold i will deliver them up into the hands of
eyes
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of
like achab whom the king of babylon fried in the fire
because they have acted folly in israel and have committed
adultery with the wives of their friends and have spoken lying words in
my name which i commanded them not i am the judge and the witness
saith the lord
and to semeias the nehelamite thou shalt say
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel because thou hast
sent letters in thy name to all the people that are in jerusalem and to
the lord hath made thee priest instead of joiada the priest that
thou shouldst be ruler in the house of the lord over every man that
raveth and prophesieth to put him in the stocks and into prison
and now why hast thou not rebuked jeremias the anathothite who
prophesieth to you
for he hath also sent to us in babylon saying it is a long
time build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the
fruits of them
so sophonias the priest read this letter in the hearing of
and the word of the lord came to jeremias saying
send to all them of the captivity saying thus saith the lord to
sent him not and hath caused you to trust in a lie
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will visit upon semeias
the nehelamite and upon his seed he shall not have a man to sit in the
midst of this people and he shall not see the good that i will do to my
people saith the lord because he hath spoken treason against the lord
king and his church shall be glorious for ever
this is the word that came to jeremias from the lord saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel saying write thee all the
words that i have spoken to thee in a book
for behold the days come saith the lord and i will bring again
the captivity of my people israel and juda saith the lord and i will
cause them to return to the land which i gave to their fathers and they
shall possess it
and these are the words that the lord hath spoken to israel and to
for thus saith the lord we have heard a voice of terror there is
fear and no peace
ask ye and see if a man bear children why then have i seen every
man with his hands on his loins like a woman in labour and all faces
are turned yellow
alas for that day is great neither is there the like to it and
it is the time of tribulation to jacob but he shall be saved out of it
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts
that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst his bands
and strangers shall no more rule over him
but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king
whom i will raise up to them
therefore fear thou not my servant jacob saith the lord
neither be dismayed o israel for behold i will save thee from a
country afar off and thy seed from the land of their captivity and
there shall be none whom he may fear
for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee for i will
utterly consume all the nations among which i have scattered thee but
that thou mayst not seem to thyself innocent
for thus saith the lord thy bruise is incurable thy wound is
very grievous
there is none to judge thy judgment to bind it up thou hast no
healing medicines
all thy lovers have forgotten thee and will not seek after thee
for i have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with cruel
chastisement by reason of the multitude of thy iniquities thy sins are
hardened
why criest thou for thy affliction thy sorrow is incurable for
the multitude of thy iniquity and for thy hardened sins i have done
these things to thee
therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all
thy enemies shall be carried into captivity and they that waste thee
shall be wasted and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey
for i will close up thy scar and will heal thee of thy wounds
saith the lord because they have called thee o sion an outcast this
is she that hath none to seek after her
thus saith the lord behold i will bring back the captivity of
the pavilions of jacob and will have pity on his houses and the city
shall be built in her high place and the temple shall be founded
according to the order thereof
and out of them shall come forth praise and the voice of them
that play and i will multiply them and they shall not be made few and
and their children shall be as from the beginning and their
assembly shall be permanent before me and i will visit against all that
afflict them
and their leader shall be of themselves and their prince shall
come forth from the midst of them and i will bring him near and he
shall come to me for who is this that setteth his heart to approach to
me saith the lord
and you shall be my people and i will be your god
behold the whirlwind of the lord his fury going forth a violent
storm it shall rest upon the head of the wicked
the lord will not turn away the wrath of his indignation till he
have executed and performed the thought of his heart in the latter days
you shall understand these things
covenant the church shall never fail
at that time saith the lord i will be the god of all the
families of israel and they shall be my people
thus saith the lord the people that were left and escaped from
the sword found grace in the desert israel shall go to his rest
the lord hath appeared from afar to me yea i have loved thee with
an everlasting love therefore have i drawn thee taking pity on thee
and i will build thee again and thou shalt be built o virgin of
forth in the dances of them that make merry
thou shalt yet plant vineyards in the mountains of samaria the
planters shall plant and they shall not gather the vintage before the
time
for there shall be a day in which the watchmen on mount ephraim
shall cry arise and let us go up to sion to the lord our god
for thus saith the lord rejoice ye in the joy of jacob and neigh
before the head of the gentiles shout ye and sing and say save o
behold i will bring them from the north country and will gather
them from the ends of the earth and among them shall be the blind and
the lame the woman with child and she that is bringing forth
together a great company of them returning hither
they shall come with weeping and i will bring them back in mercy
and i will bring them through the torrents of waters in a right way and
they shall not stumble in it for i am a father to israel and ephraim
is my firstborn
hear the word of the lord o ye nations and declare it in the
islands that are afar off and say he that scattered israel will gather
him and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his flock
for the lord hath redeemed jacob and delivered him out of the
hand of one that was mightier than he
and they shall come and shall give praise in mount sion and
they shall flow together to the good things of the lord for the corn
and wine and oil and the increase of cattle and herds and their soul
shall be as a watered garden and they shall be hungry no more
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance the young men and old
men together and i will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort
them and make them joyful after their sorrow
and i will fill the soul of the priests with fatness and my
people shall be filled with my good things saith the lord
thus saith the lord a voice was heard on high of lamentation of
mourning and weeping of rachel weeping for her children and refusing
to be comforted for them because they are not
thus saith the lord let thy voice cease from weeping and thy
eyes tears for there is a reward for thy work saith the lord and they
shall return out of the land of the enemy
and there is hope for thy last end saith the lord and the
children shall return to their own borders
hearing i heard ephraim when he went into captivity thou hast
chastised me and i was instructed as a young bullock unaccustomed to
the yoke convert me and i shall be converted for thou art the lord my
for after thou didst convert me i did penance and after thou
didst shew unto me i struck my thigh i am confounded and ashamed
because i have borne the reproach of my youth
surely ephraim is an honourable son to me surely he is a tender
child for since i spoke of him i will still remember him therefore
are my bowels troubled for him pitying i will pity him saith the lord
set thee up a watchtower make to thee bitterness direct thy
heart into the right way wherein thou hast walked return o virgin of
how long wilt thou be dissolute in deliciousness o wandering
daughter for the lord hath created a new thing upon the earth a woman
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as yet shall
they say this word in the land of juda and in the cities thereof when
justice the holy mountain
and juda and all his cities shall dwell therein together the
husbandman and they that drive the flocks
for i have inebriated the weary soul and i have filled every
hungry soul
upon this i was as it were awaked out of a sleep and i saw and
my sleep was sweet to me
behold the days come saith the lord and i will sow the house of
beasts
and as i have watched over them to pluck up and to throw down
and to scatter and destroy and afflict so will i watch over them to
build up and to plant them saith the lord
in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a
sour grape and the teeth of the children are set on edge
but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that
shall eat the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge
behold the days shall come saith the lord and i will make a new
covenant with the house of israel and with the house of juda
not according to the covenant which i made with their fathers in
the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of
saith the lord
but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of
bowels and i will write it in their heart and i will be their god and
they shall be my people
and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every
man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the
least of them even to the greatest saith the lord for i will forgive
their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more
thus saith the lord who giveth the sun for the light of the day
the order of the moon and of the stars for the light of the night who
stirreth up the sea and the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts is
his name
if these ordinances shall fail before me saith the lord then
also the seed of israel shall fail so as not to be a nation before me
for ever
thus saith the lord if the heavens above can be measured and
the foundations of the earth searched out beneath i also will cast away
all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that the city shall be
built to the lord from the tower of hanameel even to the gate of the
corner
and the measuring line shall go out farther in his sight upon the
hill gareb and it shall compass goatha
and the whole valley of dead bodies and of ashes and all the
country of death even to the torrent cedron and to the corner of the
horse gate towards the east the holy of the lord it shall not be
plucked up and it shall not be destroyed any more for ever
prophesies the return of the people out of captivity and the
everlasting covenant god will make with his church
the word that came to jeremias from the lord in the tenth year of
at that time the army of the king of babylon besieged jerusalem
and jeremias the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which
was in the house of the king of juda
for sedecias king of juda had shut him up saying why dost thou
prophesy saying thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into
the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it
and sedecias king of juda shall not escape out of the hand of the
see his eyes
and he shall lead sedecias to babylon and he shall be there till
and jeremias said the word of the lord came to me saying
behold hanameel the son of sellum thy cousin shall come to thee
saying buy thee my field which is in anathoth for it is thy right to
buy it being next akin
and hanameel my uncles son came to me according to the word of
the lord to the entry of the prison and said to me buy my field
which is in anathoth in the land of benjamin for the right of
inheritance is thine and thou art next of kin to possess it and i
understood that this was the word of the lord
and i bought the field of hanameel my uncles son that is in
silver
and i wrote it in a book and sealed it and took witnesses and i
weighed him the money in the balances
and i took the deed of the purchase that was sealed and the
stipulations and the ratifications with the seals that were on the
outside
and i gave the deed of the purchase to baruch the son of neri the
son of maasias in the sight of hanameel my uncles son in the presence
of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase and before
all the jews that sat in the court of the prison
and i charged baruch before them saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take these
writings this deed of the purchase that is sealed up and this deed
that is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue
many days
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and
fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land
and after i had delivered the deed of purchase to baruch the son
of neri i prayed to the lord saying
alas alas alas o lord god behold thou hast made heaven and
earth by thy great power and thy stretched out arm no word shall be
hard to thee
thou shewest mercy unto thousands and returnest the iniquity of
the fathers into the bosom of their children after them o most mighty
great and powerful the lord of hosts is thy name
great in counsel and incomprehensible in thought whose eyes are
open upon all the ways of the children of adam to render unto every one
according to his ways and according to the fruit of his devices
who hast set signs and wonders in the land of egypt even until
this day and in israel and amongst men and hast made thee a name as
at this day
and hast brought forth thy people israel out of the land of
stretched out arm and with great terror
and hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their
fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey
and they came in and possessed it but they obeyed not thy
voice and they walked not in thy law and they did not any of those
things that thou didst command them to do and all these evils are come
upon them
behold works are built up against the city to take it and the
city is given into the hands of the chaldeans who fight against it by
the sword and the famine and the pestilence and what thou hast
spoken is all come to pass as thou thyself seest
and sayest thou to me o lord god buy a field for money and
take witnesses whereas the city is given into the hands of the
and the word of the lord came to jeremias saying
behold i am the lord the god of all flesh shall any thing be
hard for me
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will deliver this city
into the hands of the chaldeans and into the hands of the king of
and the chaldeans that fight against this city shall come and
set it on fire and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they
offered sacrifice to baal and poured out drink offerings to strange
gods to provoke me to wrath
for the children of israel and the children of juda have
continually done evil in my eyes from their youth the children of
the lord
for this city hath been to me a provocation and indignation from
the day that they built it until this day in which it shall be taken
out of my sight
because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the
children of juda which they have done provoking me to wrath they and
their kings their princes and their priests and their prophets the
men of juda and the inhabitants of jerusalem
and they have turned their backs to me and not their faces when
not hearken to receive instruction
and they have set their idols in the house in which my name is
called upon to defile it
and they have built the high places of baal which are in the
valley of the son of ennom to consecrate their sons and their daughters
to moloch which i commanded them not neither entered it into my heart
that they should do this abomination and cause juda to sin
and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel to this
city whereof you say that it shall be delivered into the hands of the
king of babylon by the sword and by famine and by pestilence
behold i will gather them together out of all the lands to which
indignation and i will bring them again into this place and will cause
them to dwell securely
and they shall be my people and i will be their god
and i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear
me all days and that it may be well with them and with their children
after them
and i will make an everlasting covenant with them and will not
cease to do them good and i will give my fear in their heart that they
may not revolt from me
and i will rejoice over them when i shall do them good and i
will plant them in this land in truth with my whole heart and with all
my soul
for thus saith the lord as i have brought upon this people all
this great evil so will i bring upon them all the good that i now speak
to them
and fields shall be purchased in this land whereof you say that
it is desolate because there remaineth neither man nor beast and it is
given into the hands of the chaldeans
fields shall be bought for money and deeds shall be written and
sealed and witnesses shall be taken in the land of benjamin and round
about jerusalem in the cities of juda and in the cities on the
mountains and in the cities of the plains and in the cities that are
towards the south for i will bring back their captivity saith the
the coming of christ whose reign in his church shall be glorious and
perpetual
and the word of the lord came to jeremias the second time while
he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying
thus saith the lord who will do and will form it and prepare
it the lord is his name
cry to me and i will hear thee and i will shew thee great things
and sure things which thou knowest not
for thus saith the lord the god of israel to the houses of this
city and to the houses of the king of juda which are destroyed and to
the bulwarks and to the sword
of them that come to fight with the chaldeans and to fill them
with the dead bodies of the men whom i have slain in my wrath and in my
indignation hiding my face from this city because of all their
wickedness
behold i will close their wounds and give them health and i will
cure them and i will reveal to them the prayer of peace and truth
for
and i will bring back the captivity of juda and the captivity of
and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have
sinned against me and i will forgive all their iniquities whereby they
have sinned against me and despised me
and it shall be to me a name and a joy and a praise and a
gladness before all the nations of the earth that shall hear of all the
good things which i will do to them and they shall fear and be troubled
for all the good things and for all the peace that i will make for
them
thus saith the lord there shall be heard again in this place
which you say is desolate because there is neither man nor beast in
the cities of juda and without jerusalem which are desolate without
man and without inhabitant and without beast
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the
bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say
endureth for ever and of them that shall bring their vows into the
house of the lord for i will bring back the captivity of the land as at
the first saith the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts there shall be again in this place
that is desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities
thereof an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down
and in the cities on the mountains and in the cities of the
plains and in the cities that are towards the south and in the land of
flocks pass again under the hand of him that numbereth them saith the
behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform the
good word that i have spoken to the house of israel and to the house of
in those days and at that time i will make the bud of justice
to spring forth unto david and he shall do judgment and justice in the
earth
in those days shall juda be saved and jerusalem shall dwell
securely and this is the name that they shall call him the lord our
just one
for thus saith the lord there shall not be cut off from david a
man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel
shall have no end
neither shall there be cut off from the priests and levites a man
before my face to offer holocausts and to burn sacrifices and to kill
victims continually
relates to the christian priesthood which shall also continue for ever
the functions of which more especially the great sacrifice of the
altar are here expressed by the name of holocausts and other offerings
of the law which were so many figures of the christian sacrifice
and the word of the lord came to jeremias saying
thus saith the lord if my covenant with the day can be made
void and my covenant with the night that there should not be day and
night in their season
also my covenant with david my servant may be made void that he
should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the levites and
priests my ministers
as the stars of heaven cannot be numbered nor the sand of the
sea be measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and
the levites my ministers
and the word of the lord came to jeremias saying
hast thou not seen what this people hath spoken saying the two
families which the lord had chosen are cast off and they have despised
my people so that it is no more a nation before them
thus saith the lord if i have not set my covenant between day
and night and laws to heaven and earth
surely i will also cast off the seed of jacob and of david my
servant so as not to take any of his seed to be rulers of the seed of
will have mercy on them
broken his covenant
the word that came to jeremias from the lord when nabuchodonosor
king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth
that were under the power of his hand and all the people fought against
thus saith the lord the god of israel go and speak to sedecias
king of juda and say to him thus saith the lord behold i will deliver
this city into the hands of the king of babylon and he shall burn it
with fire
and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but thou shalt surely
be taken and thou shalt be delivered into his hand and thy eyes shall
see the eyes of the king of babylon and his mouth shall speak with thy
mouth and thou shalt go to babylon
yet hear the word of the lord o sedecias king of juda thus saith
the lord to thee thou shalt not die by the sword
but thou shalt die in peace and according to the burnings of thy
fathers the former kings that were before thee so shall they burn
thee and they shall mourn for thee saying alas lord for i have
spoken the word saith the lord
and jeremias the prophet spoke all these words to sedecias the
king of juda in jerusalem
and the army of the king of babylon fought against jerusalem and
against all the cities of juda that were left against lachis and
against azecha for these remained of the cities of juda fenced cities
the word that came to jeremias from the lord after that king
proclamation
that every man should let his manservant and every man his
maidservant being hebrew man or a hebrew woman go free and that they
should not lord it over them to wit over the jews their brethren
and all the princes and all the people who entered into the
covenant heard that every man should let his manservant and every man
his maidservant go free and should no more have dominion over them and
they obeyed and let them go free
but afterwards they turned and brought back again their servants
and their handmaids whom they had let go free and brought them into
subjection as menservants and maidservants
and the word of the lord came to jeremias from the lord saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel i made a covenant with
your fathers in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt
out of the house of bondage saying
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother being
a hebrew who hath been sold to thee so he shall serve thee six years
and thou shalt let him go free from thee and your fathers did not
hearken to me nor did they incline their ear
and you turned to day and did that which was right in my eyes
in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and you made a covenant
in my sight in the house upon which my name is invocated
and you are fallen back and have defiled my name and you have
brought back again every man his manservant and every man his
maidservant whom you had let go free and set at liberty and you have
brought them into subjection to be your servants and handmaids
therefore thus saith the lord you have not hearkened to me in
proclaiming liberty every man to his brother and every man to his
friend behold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord to the
sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will cause you to be
removed to all the kingdoms of the earth
and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant and
have not performed the words of the covenant which they agreed to in my
presence when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts
thereof
the princes of juda and the princes of jerusalem the eunuchs
and the priests and all the people of the land that passed between the
parts of the calf
and i will give them into the hands of their enemies and into
the hands of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be
for meat to the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the earth
and sedecias the king of juda and his princes i will give into
the hands of their enemies and into the hands of them that seek their
lives and into the hands of the armies of the king of babylon which
are gone from you
behold i will command saith the lord and i will bring them
again to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and
burn it with fire and i will make the cities of juda a desolation
without an inhabitant
the word that came to jeremias from the lord in the days of joakim
the son of josias king of juda saying
go to the house of the rechabites and speak to them and bring
them into the house of the lord into one of the chambers of the
treasures and thou shalt give them wine to drink
and i took jezonias the son of jeremias the son of habsanias and
his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the rechabites
and i brought them into the house of the lord to the treasure
house of the sons of hanan the son of jegedelias the man of god which
was by the treasure house of the princes above the treasure of maasias
the son of sellum who was keeper of the entry
and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full
of wine and cups and i said to them drink ye wine
and they answered we will not drink wine because jonadab the
son of rechab our father commanded us saying you shall drink no
wine neither you nor your children for ever
neither shall ye build houses nor sow reed nor plant vineyards
nor have any but you shall dwell in tents all your days that you may
live many days upon the face of the earth in which you are strangers
therefore we have obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab
our father in all things that he commanded us so as to drink no wine
all our days neither we nor our wives nor our sons nor our
daughters
nor to build houses to dwell in nor to have vineyard or field
or seed
but we have dwelt in tents and have been obedient according to
all that jonadab our father commanded us
but when nabuchodonosor king of babylon came up to our land we
said come let us go into jerusalem from the face of the army of the
in jerusalem
and the word of the lord came to jeremias saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel go and say to
the men of juda and to the inhabitants of jerusalem will you not
receive instruction to obey my words saith the lord
the words of jonadab the son of rechab by which he commanded his
sons not to drink wine have prevailed and they have drunk none to this
day because they have obeyed the commandment of their father but i
have spoken to you rising early and speaking and you have not obeyed
me
and i have sent to you all my servants the prophets rising
early and sending and saying return ye every man from his wicked way
and make your ways good and follow not strange gods nor worship them
and you shall dwell in the land which i gave you and your fathers and
you have not inclined your ear nor hearkened to me
so the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have constantly kept the
commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people
hath not obeyed me
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold
the evil that i have pronounced against them because i have spoken to
them and they have not heard i have called to them and they have not
answered me
and jeremias said to the house of the rechabites thus saith the
of jonadab your father and have kept all his precepts and have done
all that he commanded you
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel there
shall not be wanting a man of the race of jonadab the son of rechab
standing before me for ever
brought to king joakim who burns it the prophet denounces his
judgment and causes baruch to write a new copy
and it came to pass in the fourth year of joakim the son of josias
king of juda that this word came to jeremias by the lord saying
take thee a roll of a book and thou shalt write in it all the
words that i have spoken to thee against israel and juda and against
all the nations from the day that i spoke to thee from the days of
if so be when the house of juda shall hear all the evils that i
purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his wicked
way and i will forgive their iniquity and their sin
so jeremias called baruch the son of nerias and baruch wrote from
the mouth of jeremias all the words of the lord which he spoke to him
upon the roll of a book
and jeremias commanded baruch saying i am shut up and cannot go
into the house of the lord
appears from ver but that he kept himself shut up by reason of the
persecutions he had lately met with see chap
go thou in therefore and read out of the volume which thou hast
written from my mouth the words of the lord in the hearing of all the
people in the house of the lord on the fasting day and also thou shalt
read them in the hearing of all juda that come out of their cities
if so be they may present their supplication before the lord and
may return every one from his wicked way for great is the wrath and
indignation which the lord hath pronounced against this people
and baruch the son of nerias did according to all that jeremias
the prophet had commanded him reading out of the volume the words of
the lord in the house of the lord
and it came to pass in the fifth year of joakim the son of josias
king of juda in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fast before the
come together out of the cities of juda to jerusalem
and baruch read out of the volume the words of jeremias in the
house of the lord in the treasury of gamarias the son of saphan the
scribe in the upper court in the entry of the new gate of the house of
the lord in the hearing of all the people
and when micheas the son of gamarias the son of saphan had heard
out of the book all the words of the lord
he went down into the kings house to the secretarys chamber
and behold all the princes sat there elisama the scribe and dalaias
the son of semeias and elnathan the son of achobor and gamarias the
son of saphan and sedecias the son of hananias and all the princes
and micheas told them all the words that he had heard when baruch
read out of the volume in the hearing of the people
therefore all the princes sent judi the son of nathanias the son
of selemias the son of chusi to baruch saying take in thy hand the
volume in which thou hast read in the hearing of the people and come
them
and they said to him sit down and read these things in our
hearing and baruch read in their hearing
and when they had heard all the words they looked upon one
another with astonishment and they said to baruch we must tell the
king all these words
and they asked him saying tell us how didst thou write all
these words from his mouth
and baruch said to them with his mouth he pronounced all these
words as if he were reading to me and i wrote in a volume with ink
and the princes said to baruch go and hide thee both thou and
and they went in to the king into the court but they laid up the
volume in the chamber of elisama the scribe and they told all the words
in the hearing of the king
and the king sent judi that he should take the volume who
bringing it out of the chamber of elisama the scribe read it in the
hearing of the king and of all the princes that stood about the king
now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month and
there was a hearth before him full of burning coals
and when judi had read three or four pages he cut it with the
penknife and he cast it into the fire that was upon the hearth till
all the volume was consumed with the fire that was on the hearth
and the king and all his servants that heard all these words were
not afraid nor did they rend their garments
but yet elnathan and dalaias and gamarias spoke to the king
not to burn the book and he heard them not
and the king commanded jeremiel the son of amelech and saraias
the son of ezriel and selemias the son of abdeel to take up baruch the
scribe and jeremias the prophet but the lord hid them
and the word of the lord came to jeremias the prophet after that
the king had burnt the volume and the words that baruch had written
from the mouth of jeremias saying
take thee again another volume and write in it all the former
words that were in the first volume which joakim the king of juda both
burnt
and thou shalt say to joakim the king of juda thus saith the
therein and said the king of babylon shall come speedily and shall
lay waste this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast
therefore thus saith the lord against joakim the king of juda he
shall have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall
be cast out to the heat by day and to the frost by night
three months after the death of his father was carried away to babylon
so that his reign is not worthy of notice
and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
iniquities and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of
against them but they have not heard
and jeremias took another volume and gave it to baruch the son
of nerias the scribe who wrote in it from the mouth of jeremias all the
words of the book which joakim the king of juda had burnt with fire and
there were added besides many more words than had been before
would return and burn the city he is cast into prison his conference
with sedecias
now king sedecias the son of josias reigned instead of jechonias
the son of joakim whom nabuchodonosor king of babylon made king in the
land of juda
but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did
obey the words of the lord that he spoke in the hand of jeremias the
prophet
and king sedecias sent juchal the son of selemias and sophonias
the son of maasias the priest to jeremias the prophet saying pray to
the lord our god for us
now jeremias walked freely in the midst of the people for they
had not as yet cast him into prison and the army of pharao was come out
of egypt and the chaldeans that besieged jerusalem hearing these
tidings departed from jerusalem
and the word of the lord came to jeremias the prophet saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel thus shall you say to the
king of juda who sent you to inquire of me behold the army of pharao
which is come forth to help you shall return into their own land into
and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city
and take it and burn it with fire
thus saith the lord deceive not your souls saying the chaldeans
shall surely depart and go away from us for they shall not go away
but if you should even beat all the army of the chaldeans that
fight against you and there should be left of them some wounded men
they shall rise up every man from his heart and burn this city with
fire
now when the army of the chaldeans was gone away from jerusalem
because of pharaos army
jeremias went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of
citizens
and when he was come to the gate of benjamin the captain of the
gate who was there in his turn was one named jerias the son of
saying thou art fleeing to the chaldeans
and jeremias answered it is not so i am not fleeing to the
brought him to the princes
wherefore the princes were angry with jeremias and they beat
him and cast him into the prison that was in the house of jonathan the
scribe for he was chief over the prison
so jeremias went into the house of the prison and into the
dungeon and jeremias remained there many days
then sedecias the king sending took him and asked him secretly
in his house and said is there thinkest thou any word from the lord
the hands of the king of babylon
and jeremias said to king sedecias in what have i offended
against thee or thy servants or thy people that thou hast cast me
into prison
where are your prophets that prophesied to you and said the
king of babylon shall not come against you and against this land
now therefore hear i beseech thee my lord the king let my
petition be accepted in thy sight and send me not back into the house
of jonathan the scribe lest i die there
then king sedecias commanded that jeremias should be committed
into the entry of the prison and that they should give him daily a
piece of bread beside broth till all the bread in the city were spent
and jeremias remained in the entry of the prison
dungeon he is drawn out by abdemelech and has another conference with
the king
now saphatias the son of mathan and gedelias the son of phassur
and juchal the son of selemias and phassur the son of melchias heard
the words that jeremias spoke to all the people saying
thus saith the lord whosoever shall remain in this city shall
die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence but he that shall go
forth to the chaldeans shall live and his life shall be safe and he
shall live
thus saith the lord this city shall surely be delivered into the
hand of the army of the king of babylon and he shall take it
and the princes said to the king we beseech thee that this man
may be put to death for on purpose he weakeneth the hands of the men of
war that remain in this city and the hands of the people speaking to
them according to these words for this man seeketh not peace to this
people but evil
and king sedecias said behold he is in your hands for it is not
lawful for the king to deny you any thing
then they took jeremias and cast him into the dungeon of melchias
the son of amelech which was in the entry of the prison and they let
down jeremias by ropes into the dungeon wherein there was no water but
mire and jeremias sunk into the mire
now abdemelech the ethiopian an eunuch that was in the kings
house heard that they had put jeremias in the dungeon but the king was
sitting in the gate of benjamin
and abdemelech went out of the kings house and spoke to the
king saying
my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have
done against jeremias the prophet casting him into the dungeon to die
there with hunger for there is no more bread in the city
then the king commanded abdemelech the ethiopian saying take
from hence thirty men with thee and draw up jeremias the prophet out of
the dungeon before he die
so abdemelech taking the men with him went into the kings house
that was under the storehouse and he took from thence old rags and old
rotten things and he let them down by cords to jeremias into the
dungeon
and abdemelech the ethiopian said to jeremias put these old rags
and these rent and rotten things under thy arms and upon the cords and
and they drew up jeremias with the cords and brought him forth
out of the dungeon and jeremias remained in the entry of the prison
and king sedecias sent and took jeremias the prophet to him to
the third gate that was in the house of the lord and the king said to
then jeremias said to sedecias if i shall declare it to thee
wilt thou not put me to death and if i give thee counsel thou wilt not
hearken to me
then king sedecias swore to jeremias in private saying as the
will i deliver thee into the hands of these men that seek thy life
and jeremias said to sedecias thus saith the lord of hosts the
of the king of babylon thy soul shall live and this city shall not be
burnt with fire and thou shalt be safe and thy house
but if thou wilt not go out to the princes of the king of
and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their
hand
and king sedecias said to jeremias i am afraid because of the
into their hands and they should abuse me
but jeremias answered they shall not deliver thee hearken i
beseech thee to the word of the lord which i speak to the and it
shall be well with thee and thy soul shall live
but if thou wilt not go forth this is the word which the lord
hath shewn me
behold all the women that are left in the house of the king of
they shall say thy men of peace have deceived thee and have prevailed
against thee they have plunged thy feet in the mire and in a slippery
place and they have departed from thee
promising thee peace and happiness and by their evil counsels involving
thee in misery
and all thy wives and thy children shall be brought out to the
taken by the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn this city
with fire
then sedecias said to jeremias let no man know these words and
thou shalt not die
but if the princes shall hear that i have spoken with thee and
shall come to thee and say to thee tell us what thou hast said to the
king hide it not from us and we will not kill thee and also what the
king said to thee
thou shalt say to them i presented my supplication before the
king that he would not command me to be carried back into the house of
so all the princes came to jeremias and asked him and he spoke
to them according to all the words that the king had commanded him and
they left him for nothing had been heard
but jeremias remained in the entry of the prison until the day
that jerusalem was taken and it came to pass that jerusalem was taken
eyes jeremias is set at liberty
in the ninth year of sedecias king of juda in the tenth month
came nabuchodonosor king of babylon and all his army to jerusalem and
they besieged it
and in the eleventh year of sedecias in the fourth month the
fifth day of the month the city was opened
and all the princes of the king of babylon came in and sat in the
middle gate neregel sereser semegarnabu sarsachim rabsares
and when sedecias the king of juda and all the men of war saw
them they fled and they went forth in the night out of the city by the
way of the kings garden and by the gate that was between the two
walls and they went out to the way of the desert
but the army of the chaldeans pursued after them and they took
him they brought him to nabuchodonosor king of babylon to reblatha
which is in the land of emath and he gave judgment upon him
and the king of babylon slew the sons of sedecias in reblatha
before his eyes and the king of babylon slew all the nobles of juda
he also put out the eyes of sedecias and bound him with fetters
to be carried to babylon
and the chaldeans burnt the kings house and the houses of the
people with fire and they threw down the wall of jerusalem
and nabuzardan the general of the army carried away captive to
fugitives that had gone over to him and the rest of the people that
remained
but nabuzardan the general left some of the poor people that had
nothing at all in the land of juda and he gave them vineyards and
cisterns at that time
now nabuchodonosor king of babylon had given charge to nabuzardan
the general concerning jeremias saying
take him and set thy eyes upon him and do him no harm but as
he hath a mind so do with him
therefore nabuzardan the general sent and nabuzardan and
the king of babylon
sent and took jeremias out of the court of the prison and
committed him to godolias the son of ahicam the son of saphan that he
might go home and dwell among the people
but the word of the lord came to jeremias when he was yet shut
up in the court of the prison saying go and tell abdemelech the
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will
bring my words upon this city unto evil and not unto good and they
shall be accomplished in thy sight in that day
and i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou
shalt not be given into the hands of the men whom thou fearest
but delivering i will deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by
the sword but thy life shall be saved for thee because thou hast put
thy trust in me saith the lord
that resort to him
the word that came to jeremias from the lord after that
being bound with chains among all them that were carried away from
and the general of the army taking jeremias said to him the lord
thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place
and he hath brought it and the lord hath done as he hath said
because you have sinned against the lord and have not hearkened to his
voice and this word is come upon you
now then behold i have loosed thee this day from the chains which
were upon thy hands if it please thee to come with me to babylon come
and i will set my eyes upon thee but if it do not please thee to come
with me to babylon stay here behold all the land is before thee as
thou shalt choose and whither it shall please thee to go thither go
and come not with me but dwell with godolias the son of ahicam
the son of saphan whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the
cities of juda dwell therefore with him in the midst of the people or
whithersoever it shall please thee to go go and the general of the
army gave him victuals and presents and let him go
and jeremias went to godolias the son of ahicam to masphath and
dwelt with him in the midst of the people that were left in the land
and when all the captains of the army that were scattered through
the countries they and their companions had heard that the king of
that he had committed unto him men and women and children and of the
poor of the land them that had not been carried away captive to
they came to godolias to masphath and ismahel the son of
son of thanehumeth and the children of ophi that were of netophathi
and jezonias the son of maachati they and their men
and godolias the son of ahicam the son of saphan swore to them and
to their companions saying fear not to serve the chaldeans dwell in
the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you
behold i dwell in masphath that i may answer the commandment of
the chaldeans that are sent to us but as for you gather ye the
vintage and the harvest and the oil and lay it up in your vessels
and abide in your cities which you hold
moreover all the jews that were in moab and among the children
of ammon and in edom and in all the countries when they heard that
the king of babylon had left a remnant in judea and that he had made
all the jews i say returned out of all the places to which they
had fled and they came into the land of juda to godolias to masphath
and they gathered wine and a very great harvest
then johanan the son of caree and all the captains of the army
that had been scattered about in the countries came to godolias to
and they said to him know that baalis the king of the children
of ammon hath sent ismahel the son of nathanias to kill thee and
but johanan the son of caree spoke to godolias privately in
be scattered that are gathered unto thee and the remnant of juda
perish
and godolias the son of ahicam said to johanan the son of caree
and it came to pass in the seventh month that ismahel the son of
king and ten men with him came to godolias the son of ahicam into
and ismahel the son of nathanias arose and the ten men that were
with him and they struck godolias the son of ahicam the son of saphan
with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made governor
over the land
ismahel slew also all the jews that were with godolias in
and on the second day after he had killed godolias no man yet
knowing it
there came some from sichem and from silo and from samaria
fourscore men with their beards shaven and their clothes rent and
mourning and they had offerings and incense in their hand to offer in
the house of the lord
and ismahel the son of nathanias went forth from masphath to meet
them weeping all along as he went and when he had met them he said to
them come to godolias the son of ahicam
and when they were come to the midst of the city ismahel the son
of nathanias slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and
the men that were with him
but ten men were found among them that said to ismahel kill us
not for we have stores in the field of wheat and barley and oil and
honey and he forbore and slew them not with their brethren
and the pit into which ismahel cast all the dead bodies of the men
whom he slew because of godolias is the same that king asa made for
fear of baasa the king of israel the same did ismahel the son of
then ismahel carried away captive all the remnant of the people
that were in masphath the kings daughters and all the people that
remained in masphath whom nabuzardan the general of the army had
committed to godolias the son of ahicam and ismahel the son of
but johanan the son of caree and all the captains of the
fighting men that were with him heard of the evil that ismahel the son
of nathanias had done
and taking all the men they went out to fight against ismahel
the son of nathanias and they found him by the great waters that are in
and when all the people that were with ismahel had seen johanan
the son of caree and all the captains of the fighting men that were
with him they rejoiced
and all the people whom ismahel had taken went back to masphath
and they returned and went to johanan the son of caree
but ismahel the son of nathanias fled with eight men from the
face of johanan and went to the children of ammon
then johanan the son of caree and all the captains of the
soldiers that were with him took all the remnant of the people whom
they had recovered from ismahel the son of nathanias from masphath
after that he had slain godolias the son of ahicam valiant men for war
and the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had brought
back from gabaon
and they departed and sat as sojourners in chamaam which is
near bethlehem in order to go forward and enter into egypt
from the face of the chaldeans for they were afraid of them
because ismahel the son of nathanias had slain godolias the son of
perish
then all the captains of the warriors and johanan the son of
the least to the greatest came near
and they said to jeremias the prophet let our supplication fall
before thee and pray thou for us to the lord thy god for all this
remnant for we are left but a few of many as thy eyes do behold us
and let the lord thy god shew us the way by which we may walk and
the thing that we must do
and jeremias the prophet said to them i have heard you behold i
will pray to the lord your god according to your words and whatsoever
thing he shall answer me i will declare it to you and i will hide
nothing from you
and they said to jeremias the lord be witness between us of truth
and faithfulness if we do not according to every thing for which the
whether it be good or evil we will obey the voice of the lord our
hearken to the voice of the lord our god
now after ten days the word of the lord came to jeremias
and he called johanan the son of caree and all the captains of
the fighting men that were with him and all the people from the least
to the greatest
and he said to them thus saith the lord the god of israel to
whom you sent me to present your supplications before him
if you will be quiet and remain in this land i will build you
up and not pull you down i will plant you and not pluck you up for
now i am appeased for the evil that i have done to you
appeased as i have sufficiently punished you and now i am reconciled
with you
fear not because of the king of babylon of whom you are greatly
afraid fear him not saith the lord for i am with you to save you
and to deliver you from his hand
and i will shew mercies to you and will take pity on you and
will cause you to dwell in your own land
but if you say we will not dwell in this land neither will we
hearken to the voice of the lord our god
saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we shall
see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor suffer hunger and
there we will dwell
for this now hear the word of the lord ye remnant of juda thus
saith the lord of hosts the god of israel if you set your faces to go
into egypt and enter in to dwell there
the sword which you fear shall overtake you there in the land of
and all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to dwell
there shall die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence none of
them shall remain nor escape from the face of the evil that i will
bring upon them
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as my anger
and my indignation hath been kindled against the inhabitants of
shall enter into egypt and you shall be an execration and an
astonishment and a curse and a reproach and you shall see this place
no more
this is the word of the lord concerning you o ye remnant of
day
for you have deceived your own souls for you sent me to the lord
our god saying pray for us to the lord our god and according to all
that the lord our god shall say to thee so declare unto us and we will
do it
and now i have declared it to you this day and you have not
obeyed the voice of the lord your god with regard to all the things for
which he hath sent me to you
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword and
by famine and by pestilence in the place to which you desire to go to
dwell there
carrying jeremias with them he foretells the devastation of that land
by the king of babylon
and it came to pass that when jeremias had made an end of
speaking to the people all the words of the lord their god for which
the lord their god had sent him to them all these words
azarias the son of osaias and johanan the son of caree and all
the proud men made answer saying to jeremias thou tellest a lie the
there
but baruch the son of nerias setteth thee on against us to
deliver us into the hands of the chaldeans to kill us and to cause us
to be carried away captives to babylon
so johanan the son of caree and all the captains of the soldiers
and all the people obeyed not the voice of the lord to remain in the
land of juda
but johanan the son of caree and all the captains of the soldiers
took all the remnant of juda that were returned out of all nations to
which they had before been scattered to dwell in the land of juda
men and women and children and the kings daughters and every
soul which nabuzardan the general had left with godolias the son of
of nerias
and they went into the land of egypt for they obeyed not the
voice of the lord and they came as far as taphnis
and the word of the lord came to jeremias in taphnis saying
take great stones in thy hand and thou shalt hide them in the
vault that is under the brick wall at the gate of pharaos house in
and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord of hosts the god
of israel behold i will send and take nabuchodonosor the king of
have hid and he shall set his throne over them
and he shall come and strike the land of egypt such as are for
death to death and such as are for captivity to captivity and such
as are for the sword to the sword
and he shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of egypt
and he shall burn them and he shall carry them away captives and he
shall array himself with the land of egypt as a shepherd putteth on his
garment and he shall go forth from thence in peace
and he shall break the statues of the house of the sun that are
in the land of egypt and the temples of the gods of egypt he shall burn
with fire
regarded he denounces to them their destruction
the word that came to jeremias concerning all the jews that dwelt
in the land of egypt dwelling in magdal and in taphnis and in
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel you have seen all
this evil that i have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the cities of
inhabitant in them
because of the wickedness which they have committed to provoke me
to wrath and to go and offer sacrifice and worship other gods which
neither they nor you nor your fathers knew
and i sent to you all my servants the prophets rising early and
sending and saying do not commit this abominable thing which i hate
but they heard not nor inclined their ear to turn from their evil
ways and not to sacrifice to strange gods
wherefore my indignation and my fury was poured forth and was
kindled in the cities of juda and in the streets of jerusalem and they
are turned to desolation and waste as at this day
and now thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel why do you
commit this great evil against your own souls that there should die of
you man and woman child and suckling out of the midst of juda and no
remnant should be left you
in that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands by
sacrificing to other gods in the land of egypt into which you are come
to dwell there and that you should perish and be a curse and a
reproach to all the nations of the earth
have you forgotten the evils of your fathers and the evils of the
kings of juda and the evils of their wives and your evils and the
evils of your wives that they have done in the land of juda and in the
streets of jerusalem
they are not cleansed even to this day neither have they feared
nor walked in the law of the lord nor in my commandments which i set
before you and your fathers
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold
and i will take the remnant of juda that have set their faces to
go into the land of egypt and to dwell there and they shall be all
consumed in the land of egypt they shall fall by the sword and by the
famine and they shall be consumed from the least even to the greatest
by the sword and by the famine shall they die and they shall be for an
execration and for a wonder and for a curse and for a reproach
and i will visit them that dwell in the land of egypt as i have
visited jerusalem by the sword and by famine and by pestilence
and there shall be none that shall escape and remain of the
remnant of the jews that are gone to sojourn in the land of egypt and
that shall return into the land of juda to which they have a desire to
return to dwell there there shall none return but they that shall flee
then all the men that knew that their wives sacrificed to other
gods and all the women of whom there stood by a great multitude and
all the people of them that dwelt in the land of egypt in phatures
answered jeremias saying
as for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the
but we will certainly do every word that shall proceed out of our
own mouth to sacrifice to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink
offerings to her as we and our fathers have done our kings and our
princes in the cities of juda and in the streets of jerusalem and we
were filled with bread and it was well with us and we saw no evil
but since we left off to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven
and to pour out frank offerings to her we have wanted all things and
have been consumed by the sword and by famine
and if we offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven and pour out
drink offerings to her did we make cakes to worship her to pour out
drink offerings to her without our husbands
and jeremias spoke to all the people to the men and to the
women and to all the people which had given him that answer saying
was it not the sacrifice that you offered in the cities of juda
and in the streets of jerusalem you and your fathers your kings and
your princes and the people of the land which the lord hath
remembered and hath it not entered into his heart
so that the lord could no longer bear because of the evil of
your doings and because of the abominations which you have committed
therefore your land is become a desolation and an astonishment and a
curse without an inhabitant as at this day
because you have sacrificed to idols and have sinned against the
his law and in his commandments and in his testimonies therefore are
these evils come upon you as at this day
and jeremias said to all the people and to all the women hear ye
the word of the lord all juda you that dwell in the land of egypt
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel saying you and
your wives have spoken with your mouth and fulfilled with your hands
saying let us perform our vows which we have made to offer sacrifice
to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her you have
fulfilled your vows and have performed them indeed
therefore hear ye the word of the lord all juda you that dwell
in the land of egypt behold i have sworn by my great name saith the
behold i will watch over them for evil and not for good and all
the men of juda that are in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the
sword and by famine till there be an end of them
and a few men that shall flee from the sword shall return out of
the land of egypt into the land of juda and all the remnant of juda
that are gone into the land of egypt to dwell there shall know whose
word shall stand mine or theirs
and this shall be a sign to you saith the lord that i will
punish you in this place that you may know that my words shall be
accomplished indeed against you for evil
thus saith the lord behold i will deliver pharao nechao king of
his life as i delivered sedecias king of juda into the land of
the word that jeremias the prophet spoke to baruch the son of
saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel to thee baruch
thou hast said woe is me wretch that i am for the lord hath
added sorrow to my sorrow i am wearied with my groans and i find no
rest
thus saith the lord thus shalt thou say to him behold them whom
and all this land
and dost thou seek great things for thyself seek not for behold
thy life and save thee in all places whithersoever thou shalt go
the word of the lord that came to jeremias the prophet against the
against egypt against the army of pharao nechao king of egypt
which was by the river euphrates in charcamis whom nabuchodonosor the
king of babylon defeated in the fourth year of joakim the son of josias
king of juda
prepare ye the shield and buckler and go forth to battle
harness the horses and get up ye horsemen stand forth with
helmets furbish the spears put on coats of mail
what then i have seen them dismayed and turning their backs
their valiant ones slain they fled apace and they looked not back
terror was round about saith the lord
let not the swift flee away nor the strong think to escape they
are overthrown and fallen down towards the north by the river
who is this that cometh up as a flood and his streams swell like
those of rivers
egypt riseth up like a flood and the waves thereof shall be moved
as rivers and he shall say i will go up and will cover the earth i
will destroy the city and its inhabitants
get ye up on horses and glory in chariots and let the valiant
men come forth the ethiopians and the libyans that hold the shield
and the lydians that take and shoot arrows
for this is the day of the lord the god of hosts a day of
vengeance that he may revenge himself of his enemies the sword shall
devour and shall be filled and shall be drunk with their blood for
there is a sacrifice of the lord god of hosts in the north country by
the river euphrates
go up into galaad and take balm o virgin daughter of egypt in
vain dost thou multiply medicines there shall be no cure for thee
the nations have heard of thy disgrace and thy howling hath
filled the land for the strong hath stumbled against the strong and
both are fallen together
the word that the lord spoke to jeremias the prophet how
declare ye to egypt and publish it in magdal and let it be
known in memphis and in taphnis say ye stand up and prepare thyself
for the sword shall devour all round about thee
why are thy valiant men come to nothing they stood not because
the lord hath overthrown them
he hath multiplied them that fall and one hath fallen upon
another and they shall say arise and let us return to our own people
and to the land of our nativity from the sword of the dove
call ye the name of pharao king of egypt a tumult time hath
brought
as i live saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts as
come
furnish thyself to go into captivity thou daughter inhabitant of
uninhabited
egypt is like a fair and beautiful heifer there shall come from
the north one that shall goad her
her hirelings also that lived in the midst of her like fatted
calves are turned back and are fled away together and they could not
stand for the day of their slaughter is come upon them the time of
their visitation
her voice shall sound like brass for they shall hasten with an
army and with axes they shall come against her as hewers of wood
they have cut down her forest saith the lord which cannot be
counted they are multiplied above locusts and are without number
the daughter of egypt is confounded and delivered into the hand
of the people of the north
the lord of hosts the god of israel hath said behold i will
visit upon the tumult of alexandria and upon pharao and upon egypt
and upon her gods and upon her kings and upon pharao and upon them
that trust in him
which was the ancient name of the city to which alexander gave
afterwards the name of alexandria
and i will deliver them into the hand of them that seek their
lives and into the hand of nabuchodonosor king of babylon and into the
hand of his servants and afterwards it shall be inhabited as in the
days of old saith the lord
and thou my servant jacob fear not and be not thou dismayed o
the land of thy captivity and jacob shall return and be at rest and
prosper and there shall be none to terrify him
and thou my servant jacob fear not saith the lord because i
am with thee for i will consume all the nations to which i have cast
thee out but thee i will not consume but i will correct thee in
judgment neither will i spare thee as if thou wert innocent
and ascalon
the word of the lord that came to jeremias the prophet against the
people of palestine before pharao took gaza
thus saith the lord behold there come up waters out of the north
and they shall be as an overflowing torrent and they shall cover the
land and all that is therein the city and the inhabitants thereof
then the men shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl
at the noise of the marching of arms and of his soldiers at the
rushing of his chariots and the multitude of his wheels the fathers
have not looked back to the children for feebleness of hands
because of the coming of the day in which all the philistines
shall be laid waste and tyre and sidon shall be destroyed with all the
rest of their helpers for the lord hath wasted the philistines the
remnant of the isle of cappadocia
baldness is come upon gaza ascalon hath held her peace with the
remnant of their valley how long shalt thou cut thyself
o thou sword of the lord how long wilt thou not be quiet go
into thy scabbard rest and be still
how shall it be quiet when the lord hath given it a charge
against ascalon and against the countries thereof by the sea side and
there hath made an appointment for it
captivity shall at last be released
against moab thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel woe
to nabo for it is laid waste and confounded cariathaim is taken the
strong city is confounded and hath trembled
there is no more rejoicing in moab over hesebon they have devised
evil come and let us cut it off from being a nation therefore shalt
thou in silence hold thy peace and the sword shall follow thee
a voice of crying from oronaim waste and great destruction
moab is destroyed proclaim a cry for her little ones
for by the ascent of luith shall the mourner go up with weeping
for in the descent of oronaim the enemies have heard a howling of
destruction
flee save your lives and be as heath in the wilderness
for because thou hast trusted in thy bulwarks and in thy
treasures thou also shalt be taken and chamos shall go into captivity
his priests and his princes together
and the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall
escape and the valleys shall perish and the plains shall be destroyed
for the lord hath spoken
give a flower to moab for in its flower it shall go out and the
cities thereof shall be desolate and uninhabited
cursed be he that doth the work of the lord deceitfully and
cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood
of is the punishment of the moabites
moab hath been fruitful from his youth and hath rested upon his
lees and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel nor hath gone
into captivity therefore his taste hath remained in him and his scent
is not changed
rested upon his lees that is remained in its bad morals as wine not
decanted has its lees mixed and remains muddy
therefore behold the days come saith the lord and i will send
him men that shall order and overturn his bottles and they shall cast
him down and shall empty his vessels and break their bottles one
against another
and moab shall be ashamed of chamos as the house of israel was
ashamed of bethel in which they trusted
how do you say we are valiant and stout men in battle
moab is laid waste and they have cast down her cities and her
choice young men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose
name is the lord of hosts
the destruction of moab is near to come the calamity thereof
shall come on exceeding swiftly
comfort him all you that are round about him and all you that
know his name say how is the strong staff broken the beautiful rod
come down from thy glory and sit in thirst o dwelling of the
daughter of dibon because the spoiler of moab is come up to thee he
hath destroyed thy bulwarks
stand in the way and look out o habitation of aroer inquire of
him that fleeth and say to him that hath escaped what is done
moab is confounded because he is overthrown howl ye and cry
tell ye it in arnon that moab is wasted
and judgment is come upon the plain country upon helon and upon
and upon dibon and upon nabo and upon the house of deblathaim
and upon cariathaim and upon bethgamul and upon bethmaon
and upon carioth and upon bosra and upon all the cities of the
land of moab far or near
the horn of moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith the
make him drunk because he lifted up himself against the lord
and moab shall dash his hand in his own vomit and he also shall be in
derision
for israel hath been a derision unto them as though thou hadst
found him amongst thieves for thy words therefore which thou hast
spoken against him thou shalt be led away captive
leave the cities and dwell in the rock you that dwell in moab
and be ye like the dove that maketh her nest in the mouth of the hole in
the highest place
we have heard the pride of moab he is exceeding proud his
haughtiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the loftiness of his
heart
i know saith the lord his boasting and that the strength
thereof is not according to it neither hath it endeavoured to do
according as it was able
therefore will i lament for moab and i will cry out to all moab
for the men of the brick wall that mourn
o vineyard of sabama i will weep for thee with the mourning of
of jazer the robber hath rushed in upon thy harvest and thy vintage
joy and gladness is taken away from carmel and from the land of
the grapes shall not sing the accustomed cheerful tune
from the cry of hesebon even to eleale and to jasa they have
uttered their voice from segor to oronaim as a heifer of three years
old the waters also of nemrim shall be very bad
and i will take away from moab saith the lord him that offereth
in the high places and that sacrificeth to his gods
therefore my heart shall sound for moab like pipes and my heart
shall sound like pipes for the men of the brick wall because he hath
done more than he could therefore they have perished
for every head shall be bald and every beard shall be shaven
all hands shall be tied together and upon every back there shall be
haircloth
upon all the housetops of moab and in the streets thereof
general mourning because i have broken moab as an useless vessel saith
the lord
how is it overthrown and they have howled how hath moab bowed
down the neck and is confounded and moab shall be a derision and an
example to all round about him
thus saith the lord behold he shall fly as an eagle and shall
stretch forth his wings to moab
carioth is taken and the strongholds are won and the heart of
the valiant men of moab in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in
labour
and moab shall cease to be a people because he hath gloried
against the lord
fear and the pit and the snare come upon thee o inhabitant of
calamities the snare that is the ambushes laid by the enemy
he that shall flee from the fear shall fall into the pit and he
that shall get up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for i
will bring upon moab the year of their visitation saith the lord
they that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of hesebon but
there came a fire out of hesebon and a flame out of the midst of seon
and it shall devour part of moab and the crown of the head of the
children of tumult
woe to thee moab thou hast persisted o people of chamos for
thy sons and thy daughters are taken captives
and i will bring back the captivity of moab in the last days
saith the lord hitherto the judgments of moab
against the children of ammon thus saith the lord hath israel no
sons or hath he no heir why then hath melchom inherited gad and his
people dwelt in his cities
therefore behold the days come saith the lord and i will cause
the noise of war to be heard in rabbath of the children of ammon and it
shall be destroyed into a heap and her daughters shall be burnt with
fire and israel shall possess them that have possessed him saith the
howl o hesebon for hai is wasted cry ye daughters of rabbath
gird yourselves with haircloth mourn and go about by the hedges for
together
why gloriest thou in the valleys thy valley hath flowed away o
delicate daughter that hast trusted in thy treasures and hast said
behold i will bring a fear upon thee saith the lord god of hosts
from all that are round about thee and you shall be scattered every one
out of one anothers sight neither shall there be any to gather
together them that flee
and afterwards i will cause the captives of the children of ammon
to return saith the lord
against edom thus saith the lord of hosts is wisdom no more in
unprofitable
flee and turn your backs go down into the deep hole ye
inhabitants of dedan for i have brought the destruction of esau upon
him the time of his visitation
if grapegatherers had come to thee would they not have left a
bunch if thieves in the night they would have taken what was enough
for them
but i have made esau bare i have revealed his secrets and he
cannot be hid his seed is laid waste and his brethren and his
neighbours and he shall not be
leave thy fatherless children i will make them live and thy
widows shall hope in me
for thus saith the lord behold they whose judgment was not to
drink of the cup shall certainly drink and shalt thou come off as
innocent thou shalt not come off as innocent but drinking thou shalt
drink
for i have sworn by myself saith the lord that bosra shall
become a desolation and a reproach and a desert and a curse and all
her cities shall be everlasting wastes
i have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent to
the nations gather yourselves together and come against her and let
us rise up to battle
for behold i have made thee a little one among the nations
despicable among men
thy arrogancy hath deceived thee and the pride of thy heart o
thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock and endeavourest to lay
hold on the height of the hill but though thou shouldst make thy nest
as high as an eagle i will bring thee down from thence saith the lord
and edom shall be desolate every one that shall pass by it
shall be astonished and shall hiss at all its plagues
as sodom was overthrown and gomorrha and the neighbours thereof
saith the lord there shall not a man dwell there and there shall no
son of man inhabit it
behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of the
suddenly upon her and who shall be the chosen one whom i may appoint
over her for who is like to me and who shall abide me and who is that
shepherd that can withstand my countenance
therefore hear ye the counsel of the lord which he hath taken
concerning edom and his thoughts which he hath thought concerning the
inhabitants of theman surely the little ones of the flock shall cast
them down of a truth they shall destroy them with their habitation
the earth is moved at the noise of their fall the cry of their
voice is heard in the red sea
behold he shall come up as an eagle and fly and he shall spread
his wings over bosra and in that day the heart of the valiant ones of
against damascus emath is confounded and arphad for they have
heard very bad tidings they are troubled as in the sea through care
they could not rest
damascus is undone she is put to flight trembling hath seized
on her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in labour
how have they forsaken the city of renown the city of joy
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the
men of war shall be silent in that day saith the lord of hosts
and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus and it shall
devour the strong holds of benadad
against cedar and against the kingdoms of asor which
and go ye up to cedar and waste the children of the east
etc were all brought under the yoke of nabuchodonosor
they shall take their tents and their flocks and shall carry
off for themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their
camels and they shall call fear upon them round about
flee ye get away speedily sit in deep holes you that inhabit
counsel against you and hath conceived designs against you
arise and go up to a nation that is at ease and that dwelleth
securely saith the lord they have neither gates nor bars they dwell
alone
and their camels shall be for a spoil and the multitude of their
cattle for a booty and i will scatter into every wind them that have
their hair cut round and i will bring destruction upon them from all
their confines saith the lord
and asor shall be a habitation for dragons desolate for ever no
man shall abide there nor son of man inhabit it
the word of the lord that came to jeremias the prophet against
thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will break the bow of
and i will bring upon elam the four winds from the four quarters
of heaven and i will scatter them into all these winds and there shall
be no nation to which the fugitives of elam shall not come
and i will cause elam to be afraid before their enemies and in
the sight of them that seek their life and i will bring evil upon them
my fierce wrath saith the lord and i will send the sword after them
till i consume them
and i will set my throne in elam and destroy kings and princes
from thence saith the lord
but in the latter days i will cause the captives of elam to
return saith the lord
shall be utterly destroyed
the word that the lord hath spoken against babylon and against
the land of the chaldeans in the hand of jeremias the prophet
declare ye among the nations and publish it lift up a standard
proclaim and conceal it not say babylon is taken bel is confounded
are overthrown
for a nation is come up against her out of the north which shall
make her land desolate and there shall be none to dwell therein from
man even to beast yea they are removed and gone away
in those days and at that time saith the lord the children of
weeping they shall make haste and shall seek the lord their god
they shall ask the way to sion their faces are hitherward they
shall come and shall be joined to the lord by an everlasting covenant
which shall never be forgotten
my people have been a lost flock their shepherds have caused them
to go astray and have made them wander in the mountains they have gone
from mountain to hill they have forgotten their resting place
all that found them have devoured them and their enemies said
fathers
remove out of the midst of babylon and go forth out of the land
of the chaldeans and be ye as kids at the head of the flock
for behold i raise up and will bring against babylon an assembly
of great nations from the land of the north and they shall be prepared
against her and from thence she shall be taken their arrows like
those of a mighty man a destroyer shall not return in vain
and chaldea shall be made a prey all that waste her shall be
filled saith the lord
because you rejoice and speak great things pillaging my
inheritance because you are spread abroad as calves upon the grass and
have bellowed as bulls
your mother is confounded exceedingly and she that bore you is
made even with the dust behold she shall be the last among the nations
a wilderness unpassable and dry
because of the wrath of the lord it shall not be inhabited but
shall be wholly desolate every one that shall pass by babylon shall be
astonished and shall hiss at all her plagues
prepare yourselves against babylon round about all you that bend
the bow fight against her spare not arrows because she hath sinned
against the lord
shout against her she hath every where given her hand her
foundations are fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the
vengeance of the lord take vengeance upon her as she hath done so do
to her
destroy the sower out of babylon and him that holdeth the sickle
in the time of harvest for fear of the sword of the dove every man
shall return to his people and every one shall flee to his own land
one or the other
israel is a scattered flock the lions have driven him away
first the king of assyria devoured him and last this nabuchodonosor
king of babylon hath broken his bones
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold
king of assyria
and i will bring israel again to his habitation and he shall
feed on carmel and bason and his soul shall be satisfied in mount
in those days and at that time saith the lord the iniquity of
whom i shall leave
go up against the land of the rulers and punish the inhabitants
thereof waste and destroy all behind them saith the lord and do
according to all that i have commanded thee
a noise of war in the land and a great destruction
how is the hammer of the whole earth broken and destroyed how
is babylon turned into a desert among the nations
i have caused thee to fall into a snare and thou art taken o
because thou hast provoked the lord
the lord hath opened his armoury and hath brought forth the
weapons of his wrath for the lord the god of hosts hath a work to be
done in the land of the chaldeans
come ye against her from the uttermost borders open that they
may go forth that shall tread her down take the stones out of the way
and make heaps and destroy her and let nothing of her be left
destroy all her valiant men let them go down to the slaughter
woe to them for their day is come the time of their visitation
the voice of them that flee and of them that have escaped out of
the land of babylon to declare in sion the revenge of the lord our god
the revenge of his temple
declare to many against babylon to all that bend the bow stand
together against her round about and let none escape pay her according
to her work according to all that she hath done do ye to her for she
hath lifted up herself against the lord against the holy one of israel
therefore shall her young men fall in her streets and all her
men of war shall hold their peace in that day saith the lord
behold i come against thee o proud one saith the lord the god
of hosts for thy day is come the time of thy visitation
and the proud one shall fall he shall fall down and there shall
be none to lift him up and i will kindle a fire in his cities and it
shall devour all round about him
thus saith the lord of hosts the children of israel and the
children of juda are oppressed together all that have taken them
captives hold them fast they will not let them go
their redeemer is strong the lord of hosts is his name he will
defend their cause in judgment to terrify the land and to disquiet the
inhabitants of babylon
a sword is upon the chaldeans saith the lord and upon the
inhabitants of babylon and upon her princes and upon her wise men
a sword upon her diviners and they shall be foolish a sword
upon her valiant ones and they shall be dismayed
a sword upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all
the people that are in the midst of her and they shall become as women
a sword upon her treasures and they shall be made a spoil
a drought upon her waters and they shall be dried up because it
is a land of idols and they glory in monstrous things
therefore shall dragons dwell there with the fig fauns and
ostriches shall dwell therein and it shall be no more inhabited for
ever neither shall it be built up from generation to generation
as the ancients called fauns and satyrs and as they imagined them to
live upon wild figs they called them fauni ficarii or fig fauns
as the lord overthrew sodom and gomorrha and their neighbour
cities saith the lord no man shall dwell there neither shall the son
of man inhabit it
behold a people cometh from the north and a great nation and
many kings shall rise from the ends of the earth
they shall take the bow and the shield they are cruel and
unmerciful their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall ride
upon horses like a man prepared for battle against thee o daughter of
the king of babylon hath heard the report of them and his hands
are grown feeble anguish hath taken hold of him pangs as a woman in
labour
behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the
upon her and who shall be the chosen one whom i may appoint over her
for who is like to me and who shall bear up against me and who is that
shepherd that can withstand my countenance
therefore hear ye the counsel of the lord which he hath taken
against babylon and his thoughts which he hath thought against the land
of the chaldeans surely the little ones of the flocks shall pull them
down of a truth their habitation shall be destroyed with them
at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth is moved and the
cry is heard amongst the nations
destruction of her idols
thus saith the lord behold i will raise up as it were a
pestilential wind against babylon and against the inhabitants thereof
who have lifted up their heart against me
and i will send to babylon fanners and they shall fan her and
shall destroy her land for they are come upon her on every side in the
day of her affliction
let not him that bendeth bend his bow and let not him go up that
is armed with a coat of mail spare not her young men destroy all her
army
and the slain shall fall in the land of the chaldeans and the
wounded in the regions thereof
for israel and juda have not been forsaken by their god the lord
of hosts but their land hath been filled with sin against the holy one
of israel
flee ye from the midst of babylon and let every one save his own
life be not silent upon her iniquity for it is the time of revenge
from the lord he will render unto her what she hath deserved
babylon hath been a golden cup in the hand of the lord that made
all the earth drunk the nations have drunk of her wine and therefore
they have staggered
babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed howl for her take balm
for her pain if so she may be healed
we would have cured babylon but she is not healed let us forsake
her and let us go every man to his own land because her judgment hath
reached even to the heavens and is lifted up to the clouds
the lord hath brought forth our justices come and let us
declare in sion the work of the lord our god
sharpen the arrows fill the quivers the lord hath raised up the
spirit of the kings of the medes and his mind is against babylon to
destroy it because it is the vengeance of the lord the vengeance of
his temple
upon the walls of babylon set up the standard strengthen the
watch set up the watchmen prepare the ambushes for the lord hath both
purposed and done all that he spoke against the inhabitants of babylon
o thou that dwellest upon many waters rich in treasures thy end
is come for thy entire destruction
the lord of hosts hath sworn by himself saying i will fill thee
with men as with locusts and they shall lift up a joyful shout against
thee
he that made the earth by his power that hath prepared the world
by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding
when he uttereth his voice the waters are multiplied in heaven
he lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth he hath turned
lightning into rain and hath brought forth the wind out of his
treasures
every man is become foolish by his knowledge every founder is
confounded by his idol for what he hath cast is a lie and there is no
breath in them
they are vain works and worthy to be laughed at in the time of
their visitation they shall perish
the portion of jacob is not like them for he that made all
things he it is and israel is the sceptre of his inheritance the lord
of hosts is his name
thou dashest together for me the weapons of war and with thee i
will dash nations together and with thee i will destroy kingdoms
and with thee i will break in pieces the horse and his rider
and with thee i will break in pieces the chariot and him that getteth
up into it
and with thee i will break in pieces man and woman and with thee
break in pieces the young man and the virgin
and with thee i will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock
and with thee i will break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of
oxen and with thee i will break in pieces captains and rulers
and i will render to babylon and to all the inhabitants of
saith the lord
behold i come against thee thou destroying mountain saith the
upon thee and will roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a
burnt mountain
and they shall not take of thee a stone for the corner nor a
stone for foundations but thou shalt be destroyed for ever saith the
set ye up a standard in the land sound with the trumpet among
the nations prepare the nations against her call together against her
the kings of ararat menni and ascenez number taphsar against her
bring the horse as the stinging locust
prepare the nations against her the kings of media their
captains and all their rulers and all the land of their dominion
and the land shall be in a commotion and shall be troubled for
the design of the lord against babylon shall awake to make the land of
the valiant men of babylon have forborne to fight they have
dwelt in holds their strength hath failed and they are become as
women her dwelling places are burnt her bars are broken
one running post shall meet another and messenger shall meet
messenger to tell the king of babylon that his city is taken from one
end to the other
and that the fords are taken and the marshes are burnt with
fire and the men of war are affrighted
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel the daughter
of babylon is like a thrashingfloor this is the time of her thrashing
yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come
nabuchodonosor king of babylon hath eaten me up he hath devoured
me he hath made me as an empty vessel he hath swallowed me up like a
dragon he hath filled his belly with my delicate meats and he hath
cast me out
the wrong done to me and my flesh be upon babylon saith the
habitation of sion and my blood upon the inhabitants of chaldea saith
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will judge thy cause and
will take vengeance for thee and i will make her sea desolate i and
will dry up her spring
and babylon shall be reduced to heaps a dwelling place for
dragons an astonishment and a hissing because there is no inhabitant
they shall roar together like lions they shall shake their manes
like young lions
in their heat i will set them drink and i will make them drunk
that they may slumber and sleep an everlasting sleep and awake no
more saith the lord
i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter and like rams
with kids
how is sesach taken and the renowned one of all the earth
surprised how is babylon become an astonishment among the nations
the sea is come up over babylon she is covered with the
multitude of the waves thereof
her cities are become an astonishment a land uninhabited and
desolate a land wherein none can dwell nor son of man pass through it
and i will visit against bel in babylon and i will bring forth
out of his mouth that which he had swallowed down and the nations shall
no more flow together to him for the wall also of babylon shall fall
go out of the midst of her my people that every man may save
his life from the fierce wrath of the lord
and lest your hearts faint and ye fear for the rumour that shall
be heard in the land and a rumour shall come in one year and after
this year another rumour and iniquity in the land and ruler upon
ruler
therefore behold the days come and i will visit the idols of
fall in the midst of her
and the heavens and the earth and all things that are in them
shall give praise for babylon for spoilers shall come to her from the
north saith the lord
and as babylon caused that there should fall slain in israel so
of babylon there shall fall slain in all the earth
you that have escaped the sword come away stand not still
remember the lord afar off and let jerusalem come into your mind
we are confounded because we have heard reproach shame hath
covered our faces because strangers are come upon the sanctuaries of
the house of the lord
therefore behold the days come saith the lord and i will visit
her graven things and in all her land the wounded shall groan
if babylon should mount up to heaven and establish her strength
on high from me there should come spoilers upon her saith the lord
the noise of a cry from babylon and great destruction from the
land of the chaldeans
because the lord hath laid babylon waste and destroyed out of
her the great voice and their wave shall roar like many waters their
voice hath made a noise
because the spoiler is come upon her that is upon babylon and
her valiant men are taken and their bow is weakened because the lord
who is a strong revenger will surely repay
and i will make her princes drunk and her wise men and her
captains and her rulers and her valiant men and they shall sleep an
everlasting sleep and shall awake no more saith the king whose name is
thus saith the lord of hosts that broad wall of babylon shall be
utterly broken down and her high gates shall be burnt with fire and
the labours of the people shall come to nothing and of the nations
shall go to the fire and shall perish
the word that jeremias the prophet commanded saraias the son of
in the fourth year of his reign now saraias was chief over the
prophecy
and jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to come upon
and jeremias said to saraias when thou shalt come into babylon
and shalt see and shalt read all these words
thou shalt say o lord thou hast spoken against this place to
destroy it so that there should be neither man nor beast to dwell
therein and that it should be desolate for ever
and when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book thou
shalt tie a stone to it and shalt throw it into the midst of the
and thou shalt say thus shall babylon sink and she shall not
rise up from the affliction that i will bring upon her and she shall be
utterly destroyed thus far are the words of jeremias
sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and the name of his mother was
and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord according
to all that joakim had done
for the wrath of the lord was against jerusalem and against juda
till he cast them out from his presence and sedecias revolted from the
king of babylon
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth
month the tenth day of the month that nabuchodonosor the king of
it and built forts against it round about
and the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king
and in the fourth month the ninth day of the month a famine
overpowered the city and there was no food for the people of the land
and the city was broken up and the men of war fled and went out
of the city in the night by the way of the gate that is between the two
walls and leadeth to the kings garden the chaldeans besieging the
city round about and they went by the way that leadeth to the
wilderness
but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and they
overtook sedecias in the desert which is near jericho and all his
companions were scattered from him
and when they had taken the king they carried him to the king of
upon him
and the king of babylon slew the sons of sedecias before his
eyes and he slew all the princes of juda in reblatha
and he put out the eyes of sedecias and bound him with fetters
and the king of babylon brought him into babylon and he put him in
prison till the day of his death
and in the fifth month the tenth day of the month the same is
the nineteenth year of nabuchodonosor king of babylon came nabuzardan
the general of the army who stood before the king of babylon in
and he burnt the house of the lord and the kings house and all
the houses of jerusalem and every great house he burnt with fire
and all the army of the chaldeans that were with the general
broke down all the wall of jerusalem round about
but nabuzardan the general carried away captives some of the poor
people and of the rest of the common sort who remained in the city and
of the fugitives that were fled over to the king of babylon and the
rest of the multitude
but of the poor of the land nabuzardan the general left some for
vinedressers and for husbandmen
the chaldeans also broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were
in the house of the lord and the bases and the sea of brass that was
in the house of the lord and they carried all the brass of them to
and they took the caldrons and the fleshhooks and the
psalteries and the bowls and the little mortars and all the brazen
vessels that had been used in the ministry and
the general took away the pitchers and the censers and the
pots and the basins and the candlesticks and the mortars and the
cups as many as were of gold in gold and as many as were of silver
in silver
and the two pillars and one sea and twelve oxen of brass that
were under the bases which king solomon had made in the house of the
and concerning the pillars one pillar was eighteen cubits high
and a cord of twelve cubits compassed it about but the thickness
thereof was four fingers and it was hollow within
and chapiters of brass were upon both and the height of one
chapiter was five cubits and network and pomegranates were upon the
chapiters round about all of brass the same of the second pillar and
the pomegranates
and there were ninetysix pomegranates hanging down and the
pomegranates being a hundred in all were compassed with network
and the general took saraias the chief priest and sophonias the
second priest and the three keepers of the entry
he also took out of the city one eunuch that was chief over the
men of war and seven men of them that were near the kings person that
were found in the city and a scribe an officer of the army who
exercised the young soldiers and threescore men of the people of the
land that were found in the midst of the city
and nabuzardan the general took them and brought them to the
king of babylon to reblatha
and the king of babylon struck them and put them to death in
his land
this is the people whom nabuchodonosor carried away captive in
the seventh year three thousand and twentythree jews
in the eighteenth year of nabuchodonosor eight hundred and
thirtytwo souls from jerusalem
in the three and twentieth year of nabuchodonosor nabuzardan the
general carried away of the jews seven hundred and fortyfive souls so
all the souls were four thousand six hundred
and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
captivity of joachin king of juda in the twelfth month the five and
twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the
first year of his reign lifted up the head of joachin king of juda and
brought him forth out of prison
and he spoke kindly to him and he set his throne above the
thrones of the kings that were with him in babylon
and he changed his prison garments and he ate bread before him
always all the days of his life
and for his diet a continual provision was allowed him by the
king of babylon every day a portion until the day of his death all
the days of his life
his people and the destruction of jerusalem and the temple in hebrew
verses beginning with different letters according to the order of the
