the wicked and to hearken to the voice of wisdom
the parables of solomon the son of david king of israel
to know wisdom and instruction
to understand the words of prudence and to receive the instruction
of doctrine justice and judgment and equity
to give subtilty to little ones to the young man knowledge and
understanding
a wise man shall hear and shall be wiser and he that
understandeth shall possess governments
he shall understand a parable and the interpretation the words of
the wise and their mysterious sayings
the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom fools despise
wisdom and instruction
my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law
of thy mother
that grace may be added to thy head and a chain of gold to thy
neck
my son if sinners shall entice thee consent not to them
if they shall say come with us let us lie in wait for blood let
us hide snares for the innocent without cause
let us swallow him up alive like hell and whole as one that goeth
down into the pit
we shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses
with spoils
cast in thy lot with us let us all have one purse
my son walk not thou with them restrain thy foot from their
paths
for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood
but a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have
wings
and they themselves lie in wait for their own blood and practise
deceits against their own souls
so the ways of every covetous man destroy the souls of the
possessors
wisdom preacheth abroad she uttereth her voice in the streets
at the head of multitudes she crieth out in the entrance of the
gates of the city she uttereth her words saying
o children how long will you love childishness and fools covet
those things which are hurtful to themselves and the unwise hate
knowledge
turn ye at my reproof behold i will utter my spirit to you and
will shew you my words
because i called and you refused i stretched out my hand and
there was none that regarded
you have despised all my counsel and have neglected my
reprehensions
i also will laugh in your destruction and will mock when that
shall come to you which you feared
when sudden calamity shall fall on you and destruction as a
tempest shall be at hand when tribulation and distress shall come upon
you
then shall they call upon me and i will not hear they shall rise
in the morning and shall not find me
because they have hated instruction and received not the fear of
the lord
nor consented to my counsel but despised all my reproof
therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way and shall be
filled with their own devices
the turning away of little ones shall kill them and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them
but he that shall hear me shall rest without terror and shall
enjoy abundance without fear of evils
my son if thou wilt receive my words and wilt hide my
commandments with thee
that thy ear may hearken to wisdom incline thy heart to know
prudence
for if thou shalt call for wisdom and incline thy heart to
prudence
if thou shalt seek her as money and shalt dig for her as for a
treasure
then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord and shalt find the
knowledge of god
because the lord giveth wisdom and out of his mouth cometh
prudence and knowledge
he wilt keep the salvation of the righteous and protect them that
walk in simplicity
keeping the paths of justice and guarding the ways of saints
then shalt thou understand justice and judgment and equity and
every good path
if wisdom shall enter into thy heart and knowledge please thy
soul
counsel shall keep thee and prudence shall preserve thee
that thou mayst be delivered from the evil way and from the man
that speaketh perverse things
who leave the right way and walk by dark ways
who are glad when they have done evil and rejoice in the most
wicked things
whose ways are perverse and their steps infamous
that thou mayst be delivered from the strange woman and from the
stranger who softeneth her words
and forsaketh the guide of her youth
and hath forgotten the covenant of her god for her house
inclineth unto death and her paths to hell
none that go in unto her shall return again neither shall they
take hold of the paths of life
that thou mayst walk in a good way and mayst keep the paths of
the just
for they that are upright shall dwell in the earth and the
simple shall continue in it
but the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth and they that do
unjustly shall be taken away from it
my son forget not my law and let thy heart keep my commandments
for they shall add to thee length of days and years of life and
peace
let not mercy and truth leave thee put them about thy neck and
write them in the tables of thy heart
and thou shalt find grace and good understanding before god and
men
have confidence in the lord with all thy heart and lean not upon
thy own prudence
in all thy ways think on him and he will direct thy steps
be not wise in thy own conceit fear god and depart from evil
for it shall be health to thy navel and moistening to thy bones
honour the lord with thy substance and give him of the first of
all thy fruits
and thy barns shall be filled with abundance and thy presses
shall run over with wine
my son reject not the correction of the lord and do not faint
when thou art chastised by him
for whom the lord loveth he chastiseth and as a father in the
son he pleaseth himself
blessed is the man that findeth wisdom and is rich in prudence
the purchasing thereof is better than the merchandise of silver
and her fruit than the chief and purest gold
she is more precious than all riches and all the things that are
desired are not to be compared to her
length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches
and glory
her ways are beautiful ways and all her paths are peaceable
she is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her and he that
shall retain her is blessed
the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth hath established the
heavens by prudence
by his wisdom the depths have broken out and the clouds grow
thick with dew
my son let not these things depart from thy eyes keep the law
and counsel
and there shall be life to thy soul and grace to thy mouth
then shalt thou walk confidently in thy way and thy foot shall
not stumble
if thou sleep thou shalt not fear thou shalt rest and thy sleep
shall be sweet
be not afraid of sudden fear nor of the power of the wicked
falling upon thee
for the lord will be at thy side and will keep thy foot that thou
be not taken
do not withhold him from doing good who is able if thou art
able do good thyself also
say not to thy friend go and come again and to morrow i will
give to thee when thou canst give at present
practise not evil against thy friend when he hath confidence in
thee
strive not against a man without cause when he hath done thee no
evil
envy not the unjust man and do not follow his ways
for every mocker is an abomination to the lord and his
communication is with the simple
want is from the lord in the house of the wicked but the
habitations of the just shall be blessed
he shall scorn the scorners and to the meek he will give grace
the wise shall possess glory the promotion of fools is disgrace
hear ye children the instruction of a father and attend that
you may know prudence
i will give you a good gift forsake not my law
for i also was my fathers son tender and as an only son in the
sight of my mother
and he taught me and said let thy heart receive my words keep my
commandments and thou shalt live
get wisdom get prudence forget not neither decline from the
words of my mouth
forsake her not and she shall keep thee love her and she shall
preserve thee
the beginning of wisdom get wisdom and with all thy possession
purchase prudence
take hold on her and she shall exalt thee thou shalt be glorified
by her when thou shalt embrace her
she shall give to thy head increase of graces and protect thee
with a noble crown
hear o my son and receive my words that years of life may be
multiplied to thee
i will shew thee the way of wisdom i will lead thee by the paths
of equity
which when thou shalt have entered thy steps shall not be
straitened and when thou runnest thou shalt not meet a stumblingblock
take hold on instruction leave it not keep it because it is thy
life
be not delighted in the paths of the wicked neither let the way
of evil men please thee
flee from it pass not by it go aside and forsake it
for they sleep not except they have done evil and their sleep is
taken away unless they have made some to fall
they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of iniquity
but the path of the just as a shining light goeth forwards and
increaseth even to perfect day
the way of the wicked is darksome they know not where they fall
my son hearken to my words and incline thy ear to my sayings
let them not depart from thy eyes keep them in the midst of thy
heart
for they are life to those that find them and health to all
flesh
with all watchfulness keep thy heart because life issueth out
from it
remove from thee a froward mouth and let detracting lips be far
from thee
let thy eyes look straight on and let thy eyelids go before thy
steps
make straight the path for thy feet and all thy ways shall be
established
decline not to the right hand nor to the left turn away thy foot
from evil for the lord knoweth the ways that are on the right hand but
those are perverse which are on the left hand but he will make thy
courses straight he will bring forward thy ways in peace
my son attend to my wisdom and incline thy ear to my prudence
that thou mayst keep thoughts and thy lips may preserve
instruction mind not the deceit of a woman
for the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping and her
throat is smoother than oil
but her end is bitter as wormwood and sharp as a twoedged sword
her feet go down into death and her steps go in as far as hell
they walk not by the path of life her steps are wandering and
unaccountable
now therefore my son hear me and depart not from the words of
my mouth
remove thy way far from her and come not nigh the doors of her
house
give not thy honour to strangers and thy years to the cruel
lest strangers be filled with thy strength and thy labours be in
another mans house
and thou mourn at the last when thou shalt have spent thy flesh
and thy body and say
why have i hated instruction and my heart consented not to
reproof
and have not heard the voice of them that taught me and have not
inclined my ear to masters
i have almost been in all evil in the midst of the church and of
the congregation
drink water out of thy own cistern and the streams of thy own
well
let thy fountains be conveyed abroad and in the streets divide
thy waters
keep them to thyself alone neither let strangers be partakers
with thee
let thy vein be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth
let her be thy dearest hind and most agreeable fawn let her
breasts inebriate thee at all times be thou delighted continually with
her love
why art thou seduced my son by a strange woman and art
cherished in the bosom of another
the lord beholdeth the ways of man and considereth all his steps
his own iniquities catch the wicked and he is fast bound with the
ropes of his own sins
he shall die because he hath not received instruction and in the
multitude of his folly he shall be deceived
my son if thou be surety for thy friend thou hast engaged fast
thy hand to a stranger
thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth and caught with thy
own words
do therefore my son what i say and deliver thyself because
thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour run about make haste
stir up thy friend
give not sleep to thy eyes neither let thy eyelids slumber
deliver thyself as a doe from the hand and as a bird from the hand
of the fowler
go to the ant o sluggard and consider her ways and learn wisdom
which although she hath no guide nor master nor captain
provideth her meat for herself in the summer and gathereth her
food in the harvest
how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wilt thou arise out of
thy sleep
thou wilt sleep a little thou wilt slumber a little thou wilt
fold thy hands a little to sleep
and want shall come upon thee as a traveller and poverty as a
man armed but if thou be diligent thy harvest shall come as a
fountain and want shall flee far from thee
a man that is an apostate an unprofitable man walketh with a
perverse mouth
he winketh with the eyes presseth with the foot speaketh with
the finger
with a wicked heart he deviseth evil and at all times he soweth
discord
to such a one his destruction shall presently come and he shall
suddenly be destroyed and shall no longer have any remedy
six things there are which the lord hateth and the seventh his
soul detesteth
haughty eyes a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood
a heart that deviseth wicked plots feet that are swift to run
into mischief
a deceitful witness that uttereth lies and him that soweth
discord among brethren
my son keep the commandments of thy father and forsake not the
law of thy mother
bind them in thy heart continually and put them about thy neck
when thou walkest let them go with thee when thou sleepest let
them keep thee and when thou awakest talk with them
because the commandment is a lamp and the law a light and
reproofs of instruction are the way of life
that they may keep thee from the evil woman and from the
flattering tongue of the stranger
let not thy heart covet her beauty be not caught with her winks
for the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf but the woman
catcheth the precious soul of a man
can a man hide fire in his bosom and his garments not burn
or can he walk upon hot coals and his feet not be burnt
so he that goeth in to his neighbours wife shall not be clean
when he shall touch her
the fault is not so great when a man hath stolen for he stealeth
to fill his hungry soul
to be compared with adultery especially when a person pressed with
hunger which is the case here spoken of steals to satisfy nature
the wrong done by adultery but this does not hinder but that theft
also is a mortal sin forbidden by one of the ten commandments
and if he be taken he shall restore sevenfold and shall give up
all the substance of his house
but he that is an adulterer for the folly of his heart shall
destroy his own soul
he gathereth to himself shame and dishonour and his reproach
shall not be blotted out
because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the
day of revenge
nor will he yield to any mans prayers nor will he accept for
satisfaction ever so many gifts
temptation
my son keep my words and lay up my precepts with thee son
keep my commandments and thou shalt live and my law as the apple
of thy eye
bind it upon thy fingers write it upon the tables of thy heart
say to wisdom thou art my sister and call prudence thy friend
that she may keep thee from the woman that is not thine and from
the stranger who sweeteneth her words
for i looked out of the window of my house through the lattice
and i see little ones i behold a foolish young man
who passeth through the street by the corner and goeth nigh the
way of her house
in the dark when it grows late in the darkness and obscurity of
the night
and behold a woman meeteth him in harlots attire prepared to
deceive souls talkative and wandering
not bearing to be quiet not able to abide still at home
now abroad now in the streets now lying in wait near the
corners
and catching the young man she kisseth him and with an impudent
face flattereth saying
i vowed victims for prosperity this day i have paid my vows
therefore i am come out to meet thee desirous to see thee and i
have found thee
i have woven my bed with cords i have covered it with painted
tapestry brought from egypt
i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon
come let us be inebriated with the breasts and let us enjoy the
desired embraces till the day appear
for my husband is not at home he is gone a very long journey
he took with him a bag of money he will return home the day of
the full moon
she entangled him with many words and drew him away with the
flattery of her lips
immediately he followeth her as an ox led to be a victim and as a
lamb playing the wanton and not knowing that he is drawn like a fool to
bonds
till the arrow pierce his liver as if a bird should make haste to
the snare and knoweth not that his life is in danger
now therefore my son hear me and attend to the words of my
mouth
let not thy mind be drawn away in her ways neither be thou
deceived with her paths
for she hath cast down many wounded and the strongest have been
slain by her
her house is the way to hell reaching even to the inner chambers
of death
doth not wisdom cry aloud and prudence put forth her voice
standing in the top of the highest places by the way in the midst
of the paths
beside the gates of the city in the very doors she speaketh
saying
o ye men to you i call and my voice is to the sons of men
o little ones understand subtlety and ye unwise take notice
hear for i will speak of great things and my lips shall be opened
to preach right things
my mouth shall meditate truth and my lips shall hate wickedness
all my words are just there is nothing wicked nor perverse in
them
they are right to them that understand and just to them that find
knowledge
receive my instruction and not money choose knowledge rather
than gold
for wisdom is better than all the most precious things and
whatsoever may be desired cannot be compared to it
i wisdom dwell in counsel and am present in learned thoughts
the fear of the lord hateth evil i hate arrogance and pride and
every wicked way and a mouth with a double tongue
counsel and equity is mine prudence is mine strength is mine
by me kings reign and lawgivers decree just things
by me princes rule and the mighty decree justice
i love them that love me and they that in the morning early watch
for me shall find me
with me are riches and glory glorious riches and justice
for my fruit is better than gold and the precious stone and my
blossoms than choice silver
i walk in the way of justice in the midst of the paths of
judgment
that i may enrich them that love me and may fill their treasures
the lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways before he made
any thing from the beginning
i was set up from eternity and of old before the earth was made
the depths were not as yet and i was already conceived neither
had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out
the mountains with their huge bulk had not as yet been
established before the hills i was brought forth
he had not yet made the earth nor the rivers nor the poles of
the world
when he prepared the heavens i was present when with a certain
law and compass he enclosed the depths
when he established the sky above and poised the fountains of
waters
when he compassed the sea with its bounds and set a law to the
waters that they should not pass their limits when he balanced the
foundations of the earth
i was with him forming all things and was delighted every day
playing before him at all times
playing in the world and my delights were to be with the children
of men
now therefore ye children hear me blessed are they that keep
my ways
hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not
blessed is the man that heareth me and that watcheth daily at my
gates and waiteth at the posts of my doors
he that shall find me shall find life and shall have salvation
from the lord
but he that shall sin against me shall hurt his own soul all that
hate me love death
wisdom hath built herself a house she hath hewn her out seven
pillars
she hath slain her victims mingled her wine and set forth her
table
she hath sent her maids to invite to the tower and to the walls of
the city
whosoever is a little one let him come to me and to the unwise
she said
come eat my bread and drink the wine which i have mingled for
you
forsake childishness and live and walk by the ways of prudence
he that teacheth a scorner doth an injury to himself and he that
rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot
rebuke not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he
will love thee
give an occasion to a wise man and wisdom shall be added to him
the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge
of the holy is prudence
for by me shall thy days be multiplied and years of life shall be
added to thee
if thou be wise thou shalt be so to thyself and if a scorner
thou alone shalt bear the evil
a foolish woman and clamorous and full of allurements and
knowing nothing at all
sat at the door of her house upon a seat in a high place of the
city
to call them that pass by the way and go on their journey
he that is a little one let him turn to me and to the fool she
said
stolen waters are sweeter and hidden bread is more pleasant
and he did not know that giants are there and that her guests are
in the depths of hell
axioms relating to wisdom and folly virtue and vice
a wise son maketh the father glad but a foolish son is the sorrow
of his mother
treasures of wickedness shall profit nothing but justice shall
deliver from death
the lord will not afflict the soul of the just with famine and he
will disappoint the deceitful practices of the wicked
the slothful hand hath wrought poverty but the hand of the
industrious getteth riches he that trusteth to lies feedeth the winds
and the same runneth after birds that fly away
he that gathereth in the harvest is a wise son but he that
snorteth in the summer is the son of confusion
the blessing of the lord is upon the head of the just but
iniquity covereth the mouth of the wicked
the memory of the just is with praises and the name of the wicked
shall rot
the wise of heart receiveth precepts a fool is beaten with lips
he that walketh sincerely walketh confidently but he that
perverteth his ways shall be manifest
he that winketh with the eye shall cause sorrow and the foolish
in lips shall be beaten
the mouth of the just is a vein of life and the mouth of the
wicked covereth iniquity
hatred stirreth up strifes and charity covereth all sins
in the lips of the wise is wisdom found and a rod on the back of
him that wanteth sense
wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the fool is next to
confusion
the substance of a rich man is the city of his strength the fear
of the poor is their poverty
the work of the just is unto life but the fruit of the wicked
unto sin
the way of life to him that observeth correction but he that
forsaketh reproofs goeth astray
lying lips hide hatred he that uttereth reproach is foolish
in the multitude of words there shall not want sin but he that
refraineth his lips is most wise
the tongue of the just is as choice silver but the heart of the
wicked is nothing worth
the lips of the just teach many but they that are ignorant
shall die in the want of understanding
the blessing of the lord maketh men rich neither shall
affliction be joined to them
a fool worketh mischief as it were for sport but wisdom is
prudence to a man
that which the wicked feareth shall come upon him to the just
their desire shall be given
as a tempest that passeth so the wicked shall be no more but
the just is as an everlasting foundation
as vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes so is the
sluggard to them that sent him
the fear of the lord shall prolong days and the years of the
wicked shall be shortened
the expectation of the just is joy but the hope of the wicked
shall perish
the strength of the upright is the way of the lord and fear to
them that work evil
the just shall never be moved but the wicked shall not dwell on
the earth
the mouth of the just shall bring forth wisdom the tongue of the
perverse shall perish
the lips of the just consider what is acceptable and the mouth
of the wicked uttereth perverse things
a deceitful balance is an abomination before the lord and a just
weight is his will
where pride is there also shall be reproach but where humility
is there also is wisdom
the simplicity of the just shall guide them and the deceitfulness
of the wicked shall destroy them
riches shall not profit in the day of revenge but justice shall
deliver from death
the justice of the upright shall make his way prosperous and the
wicked man shall fall by his own wickedness
the justice of the righteous shall deliver them and the unjust
shall be caught in their own snares
when the wicked man is dead there shall be no hope any more and
the expectation of the solicitous shall perish
the just is delivered out of distress and the wicked shall be
given up for him
the dissembler with his mouth deceiveth his friend but the just
shall be delivered by knowledge
when it goeth well with the just the city shall rejoice and
when the wicked perish there shall be praise
by the blessing of the just the city shall be exalted and by the
mouth of the wicked it shall be overthrown
he that despiseth his friend is mean of heart but the wise man
will hold his peace
he that walketh deceitfully revealeth secrets but he that is
faithful concealeth the thing committed to him by his friend
where there is no governor the people shall fall but there is
safety where there is much counsel
he shall be afflicted with evil that is surety for a stranger
but he that is aware of snares shall be secure
a gracious woman shall find glory and the strong shall have
riches
a merciful man doth good to his own soul but he that is cruel
casteth off even his own kindred
the wicked maketh an unsteady work but to him that soweth
justice there is a faithful reward
clemency prepareth life and the pursuing of evil things death
a perverse heart is abominable to the lord and his will is in
them that walk sincerely
hand in hand the evil man shall not be innocent but the seed of
the just shall be saved
a golden ring in a swines snout a woman fair and foolish
the desire of the just is all good the expectation of the wicked
is indignation
some distribute their own goods and grow richer others take
away what is not their own and are always in want
the soul that blesseth shall be made fat and he that
inebriateth shall be inebriated also himself
he that hideth up corn shall be cursed among the people but a
blessing upon the head of them that sell
well doth he rise early who seeketh good things but he that
seeketh after evil things shall be oppressed by them
he that trusteth in his riches shall fall but the just shall
spring up as a green leaf
he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the winds and the
fool shall serve the wise
the fruit of the just man is a tree of life and he that gaineth
souls is wise
if the just man receive in the earth how much more the wicked
and the sinner
he that loveth correction loveth knowledge but he that hateth
reproof is foolish
he that is good shall draw grace from the lord but he that
trusteth in his own devices doth wickedly
man shall not be strengthened by wickedness and the root of the
just shall not be moved
a diligent woman is a crown to her husband and she that doth
things worthy of confusion is as rottenness in his bones
the thoughts of the just are judgments and the counsels of the
wicked are deceitful
the words of the wicked lie in wait for blood the mouth of the
just shall deliver them
turn the wicked and they shall not be but the house of the just
shall stand firm
a man shall be known by his learning but he that is vain and
foolish shall be exposed to contempt
better is the poor man that provideth for himself than he that is
glorious and wanteth bread
the just regardeth the lives of his beasts but the bowels of the
wicked are cruel
he that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread but he
that pursueth idleness is very foolish he that is delighted in passing
his time over wine leaveth a reproach in his strong holds
the desire of the wicked is the fortification of evil men but
the root of the just shall prosper
for the sins of the lips ruin draweth nigh to the evil man but
the just shall escape out of distress
by the fruit of his own mouth shall a man be filled with good
things and according to the works of his hands it shall be repaid him
the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that is wise
hearkeneth unto counsels
a fool immediately sheweth his anger but he that dissembleth
injuries is wise
he that speaketh that which he knoweth sheweth forth justice
but he that lieth is a deceitful witness
there is that promiseth and is pricked as it were with a sword
of conscience but the tongue of the wise is health
the lip of truth shall be steadfast for ever but he that is a
hasty witness frameth a lying tongue
deceit is in the heart of them that think evil things but joy
followeth them that take counsels of peace
whatsoever shall befall the just man shall not make him sad but
the wicked shall be filled with mischief
lying lips are an abomination to the lord but they that deal
faithfully please him
a cautious man concealeth knowledge and the heart of fools
publisheth folly
the hand of the valiant shall bear rule but that which is
slothful shall be under tribute
grief in the heart of a man shall bring him low but with a good
word he shall be made glad
he that neglecteth a loss for the sake of a friend is just but
the way of the wicked shall deceive them
the deceitful man shall not find gain but the substance of a
just man shall be precious gold
in the path of justice is life but the byeway leadeth to death
a wise son heareth the doctrine of his father but he that is a
scorner heareth not when he is reproved
of the fruit of his own month shall a man be filled with good
things but the soul of transgressors is wicked
he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his soul but he that hath no
guard on his speech shall meet with evils
the sluggard willeth and willeth not but the soul of them that
work shall be made fat
the just shall hate a lying word but the wicked confoundeth and
shall be confounded
justice keepeth the way of the innocent but wickedness
overthroweth the sinner
one is as it were rich when he hath nothing and another is as it
were poor when he hath great riches
the ransom of a mans life are his riches but he that is poor
beareth not reprehension
the light of the just giveth joy but the lamp of the wicked shall
be put out
among the proud there are always contentions but they that do
all things with counsel are ruled by wisdom
substance got in haste shall be diminished but that which by
little and little is gathered with the hand shall increase
hope that is deferred afflicteth the soul desire when it cometh
is a tree of life
whosoever speaketh ill of any thing bindeth himself for the time
to come but he that feareth the commandment shall dwell in peace
mercy
the law of the wise is a fountain of life that he may decline
from the ruin of death
good instruction shall give grace in the way of scorners is a
deep pit
the prudent man doth all things with counsel but he that is a
fool layeth open his folly
the messenger of the wicked shall fall into mischief but a
faithful ambassador is health
poverty and shame to him that refuseth instruction but he that
yieldeth to reproof shall be glorified
the desire that is accomplished delighteth the soul fools hate
them that flee from evil things
he that walketh with the wise shall be wise a friend of fools
shall become like to them
evil pursueth sinners and to the just good shall be repaid
the good man leaveth heirs sons and grandsons and the
substance of the sinner is kept for the just
much food is in the tillage of fathers but for others it is
gathered without judgment
he that spareth the rod hateth his son but he that loveth him
correcteth him betimes
the just eateth and filleth his soul but the belly of the wicked
is never to be filled
a wise woman buildeth her house but the foolish will pull down
with her hands that also which is built
he that walketh in the right way and feareth god is despised by
him that goeth by an infamous way
in the mouth of a fool is the rod of pride but the lips of the
wise preserve them
where there are no oxen the crib is empty but where there is
much corn there the strength of the ox is manifest
a faithful witness will not lie but a deceitful witness uttereth
a lie
a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not the learning of the
wise is easy
go against a foolish man and he knoweth not the lips of prudence
the wisdom of a discreet man is to understand his way and the
imprudence of fools erreth
a fool will laugh at sin but among the just grace shall abide
the heart that knoweth the bitterness of his own soul in his joy
the stranger shall not intermeddle
the house of the wicked shall be destroyed but the tabernacles
of the just shall flourish
there is a way which seemeth just to a man but the ends thereof
lead to death
laughter shall be mingled with sorrow and mourning taketh hold
of the ends of joy
a fool shall be filled with his own ways and the good man shall
be above him
the innocent believeth every word the discreet man considereth
his steps no good shall come to the deceitful son but the wise
servant shall prosper in his dealings and his way shall be made
straight
a wise man feareth and declineth from evil the fool leapeth
over and is confident
the impatient man shall work folly and the crafty man is
hateful
the childish shall possess folly and the prudent shall look for
knowledge
the evil shall fall down before the good and the wicked before
the gates of the just
the poor man shall be hateful even to his own neighbour but the
friends of the rich are many
he that despiseth his neighbour sinneth but he that sheweth
mercy to the poor shall be blessed he that believeth in the lord
loveth mercy
they err that work evil but mercy and truth prepare good things
in much work there shall be abundance but where there are many
words there is oftentimes want
the crown of the wise is their riches the folly of fools
imprudence
a faithful witness delivereth souls and the double dealer
uttereth lies
in the fear of the lord is confidence of strength and there
shall be hope for his children
the fear of the lord is a fountain of life to decline from the
ruin of death
in the multitude of people is the dignity of the king and in the
small number of the people the dishonour of the prince
he that is patient is governed with much wisdom but he that is
impatient exalteth his folly
soundness of heart is the life of the flesh but envy is the
rottenness of the bones
he that oppresseth the poor upbraideth his maker but he that
hath pity on the poor honoureth him
the wicked man shall be driven out in his wickedness but the
just hath hope in his death
in the heart of the prudent resteth wisdom and it shall instruct
all the ignorant
justice exalteth a nation but sin maketh nations miserable
a wise servant is acceptable to the king he that is good for
nothing shall feel his anger
a mild answer breaketh wrath but a harsh word stirreth up fury
the tongue of the wise adorneth knowledge but the mouth of fools
bubbleth out folly
the eyes of the lord in every place behold the good and the evil
a peaceable tongue is a tree of life but that which is
immoderate shall crush the spirit
a fool laugheth at the instruction of his father but he that
regardeth reproofs shall become prudent in abundant justice there is
the greatest strength but the devices of the wicked shall be rooted
out
the house of the just is very much strength and in the fruits of
the wicked is trouble
the lips of the wise shall disperse knowledge the heart of fools
shall be unlike
the victims of the wicked are abominable to the lord the vows of
the just are acceptable
the way of the wicked is an abomination to the lord he that
followeth justice is beloved by him
instruction is grievous to him that forsaketh the way of life he
that hateth reproof shall die
hell and destruction are before the lord how much more the
hearts of the children of men
a corrupt man loveth not one that reproveth him nor will he go
to the wise
a glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by grief of mind
the spirit is cast down
the heart of the wise seeketh instruction and the mouth of fools
feedeth on foolishness
all the days of the poor are evil a secure mind is like a
continual feast
better is a little with the fear of the lord than great
treasures without content
it is better to be invited to herbs with love than to a fatted
calf with hatred
a passionate man stirreth up strifes he that is patient
appeaseth those that are stirred up
the way of the slothful is as a hedge of thorns the way of the
just is without offence
a wise son maketh a father joyful but the foolish man despiseth
his mother
folly is joy to the fool and the wise man maketh straight his
steps
designs are brought to nothing where there is no counsel but
where there are many counsellors they are established
a man rejoiceth in the sentence of his mouth and a word in due
time is best
the path of life is above for the wise that he may decline from
the lowest hell
the lord will destroy the house of the proud and will strengthen
the borders of the widow
evil thoughts are an abomination to the lord and pure words most
beautiful shall be confirmed by him
he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he that
hateth bribes shall live by mercy and faith sins are purged away and
by the fear of the lord every one declineth from evil
the mind of the just studieth obedience the mouth of the wicked
overfloweth with evils
the lord is far from the wicked and he will hear the prayers of
the just
the light of the eyes rejoiceth the soul a good name maketh the
bones fat
the ear that heareth the reproofs of life shall abide in the
midst of the wise
he that rejecteth instruction despiseth his own soul but he
that yieldeth to reproof possesseth understanding
the fear of the lord is the lesson of wisdom and humility goeth
before glory
it is the part of man to prepare the soul and of the lord to
govern the tongue
and soul what he is to say but after all it must be the lord that must
govern his tongue to speak to the purpose not that we can think any
thing of good without gods grace but that after we have with gods
grace thought and prepared within our souls what we would speak if god
does not govern our tongue we shall not succeed in what we speak
all the ways of a man are open to his eyes the lord is the
weigher of spirits
lay open thy works to the lord and thy thoughts shall be
directed
the lord hath made all things for himself the wicked also for the
evil day
every proud man is an abomination to the lord though hand should
be joined to hand he is not innocent the beginning of a good way is
to do justice and this is more acceptable with god than to offer
sacrifices
by mercy and truth iniquity is redeemed and by the fear of the
when the ways of man shall please the lord he will convert even
his enemies to peace
better is a little with justice than great revenues with
iniquity
the heart of man disposeth his way but the lord must direct his
steps
divination is in the lips of the king his mouth shall not err in
judgment
weight and balance are judgments of the lord and his work all
the weights of the bag
they that act wickedly are abominable to the king for the throne
is established by justice
just lips are the delight of kings he that speaketh right things
shall be loved
the wrath of a king is as messengers of death and the wise man
will pacify it
in the cheerfulness of the kings countenance is life and his
clemency is like the latter rain
get wisdom because it is better than gold and purchase
prudence for it is more precious than silver
the path of the just departeth from evils he that keepeth his
soul keepeth his way
pride goeth before destruction and the spirit is lifted up
before a fall
it is better to be humbled with the meek than to divide spoils
with the proud
the learned in word shall find good things and he that trusteth
in the lord is blessed
the wise in heart shall be called prudent and he that is sweet
in words shall attain to greater things
knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it the
instruction of fools is foolishness
the heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth and shall add
grace to his lips
well ordered words are as a honeycomb sweet to the soul and
health to the bones
there is a way that seemeth to a man right and the ends thereof
lead to death
the soul of him that laboureth laboureth for himself because
his mouth hath obliged him to it
the wicked man diggeth evil and in his lips is a burning fire
a perverse man stirreth up quarrels and one full of words
separateth princes
an unjust man allureth his friend and leadeth him into a way
that is not good
he that with fixed eyes deviseth wicked things biting his lips
bringeth evil to pass
old age is a crown of dignity when it is found in the ways of
justice
the patient man is better than the valiant and he that ruleth
his spirit than he that taketh cities
lots are cast into the lap but they are disposed of by the lord
better is a dry morsel with joy than a house full of victims with
strife
a wise servant shall rule over foolish sons and shall divide the
inheritance among the brethren
as silver is tried by fire and gold in the furnace so the lord
trieth the hearts
the evil man obeyeth an unjust tongue and the deceitful
hearkeneth to lying lips
he that despiseth the poor reproacheth his maker and he that
rejoiceth at another mans ruin shall not be unpunished
childrens children are the crown of old men and the glory of
children are their fathers
eloquent words do not become a fool nor lying lips a prince
the expectation of him that expecteth is a most acceptable jewel
whithersoever he turneth himself he understandeth wisely
he that concealeth a transgression seeketh friendships he that
repeateth it again separateth friends
a reproof availeth more with a wise man than a hundred stripes
with a fool
an evil man always seeketh quarrels but a cruel angel shall be
sent against him
it is better to meet a bear robbed of her whelps than a fool
trusting in his own folly
he that rendereth evil for good evil shall not depart from his
house
the beginning of quarrels is as when one letteth out water and
before he suffereth reproach he forsaketh judgment
he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just
both are abominable before god
what doth it avail a fool to have riches seeing he cannot buy
wisdom he that maketh his house high seeketh a downfall and he that
refuseth to learn shall fall into evils
he that is a friend loveth at all times and a brother is proved
in distress
a foolish man will clap hands when he is surety for his friend
he that studieth discords loveth quarrels and he that exalteth
his door seeketh ruin
he that is of a perverse heart shall not find good and he that
perverteth his tongue shall fall into evil
a fool is born to his own disgrace and even his father shall not
rejoice in a fool
a joyful mind maketh age flourishing a sorrowful spirit drieth
up the bones
the wicked man taketh gifts out of the bosom that he may pervert
the paths of judgment
wisdom shineth in the face of the wise the eyes of fools are in
the ends of the earth
a foolish son is the anger of the father and the sorrow of the
mother that bore him
it is no good thing to do hurt to the just nor to strike the
prince who judgeth right
he that setteth bounds to his words is knowing and wise and the
man of understanding is of a precious spirit
even a fool if he will hold his peace shall be counted wise
and if he close his lips a man of understanding
he that hath a mind to depart from a friend seeketh occasions he
shall ever be subject to reproach
a fool receiveth not the words of prudence unless thou say those
things which are in his heart
the wicked man when he is come into the depths of sins
contemneth but ignominy and reproach follow him
words from the mouth of a man are as deep water and the fountain
of wisdom is an overflowing stream
it is not good to accept the person of the wicked to decline from
the truth of judgment
the lips of a fool intermeddle with strife and his mouth
provoketh quarrels
the mouth of a fool is his destruction and his lips are the ruin
of his soul
the words of the double tongued are as if they were harmless and
they reach even to the inner parts of the bowels fear casteth down the
slothful and the souls of the effeminate shall be hungry
he that is loose and slack in his work is the brother of him that
wasteth his own works
the name of the lord is a strong tower the just runneth to it
and shall be exalted
the substance of the rich man is the city of his strength and as
a strong wall compassing him about
before destruction the heart of a man is exalted and before he
be glorified it is humbled
he that answereth before he heareth sheweth himself to be a
fool and worthy of confusion
the spirit of a man upholdeth his infirmity but a spirit that is
easily angered who can bear
a wise heart shall acquire knowledge and the ear of the wise
seeketh instruction
a mans gift enlargeth his way and maketh him room before
princes
the just is first accuser of himself his friend cometh and
shall search him
the lot suppresseth contentions and determineth even between the
mighty
a brother that is helped by his brother is like a strong city
and judgments are like the bars of cities
of the fruit of a mans mouth shall his belly be satisfied and
the offspring of his lips shall fill him
death and life are in the power of the tongue they that love it
shall eat the fruits thereof
he that hath found a good wife hath found a good thing and
shall receive a pleasure from the lord he that driveth away a good
wife driveth away a good thing but he that keepeth an adulteress is
foolish and wicked
the poor will speak with supplications and the rich will speak
roughly
a man amiable in society shall be more friendly than a brother
better is the poor man that walketh in his simplicity than a
rich man that is perverse in his lips and unwise
where there is no knowledge of the soul there is no good and he
that is hasty with his feet shall stumble
the folly of a man supplanteth his steps and he fretteth in his
mind against god
riches make many friends but from the poor man even they whom he
had depart
a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh
lies shall not escape
many honour the person of him that is mighty and are friends of
him that giveth gifts
the brethren of the poor man hate him moreover also his friends
have departed far from him he that followeth after words only shall
have nothing
but he that possesseth a mind loveth his own soul and he that
keepeth prudence shall find good things
a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh
lies shall perish
delicacies are not seemly for a fool nor for a servant to have
rule over princes
the learning of a man is known by patience and his glory is to
pass over wrongs
as the roaring of a lion so also is the anger of a king and his
cheerfulness as the dew upon the grass
a foolish son is the grief of his father and a wrangling wife is
like a roof continually dropping through
house and riches are given by parents but a prudent wife is
properly from the lord
slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and an idle soul shall
suffer hunger
he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul but he
that neglecteth his own way shall die
he that hath mercy on the poor lendeth to the lord and he will
repay him
chastise thy son despair not but to the killing of him set not
thy soul
he that is impatient shall suffer damage and when he shall take
away he shall add another thing
hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayst be wise in
thy latter end
there are many thoughts in the heart of a man but the will of
the lord shall stand firm
a needy man is merciful and better is the poor than the lying
man
the fear of the lord is unto life and he shall abide in the
fulness without being visited with evil
the slothful hideth his hand under his armpit and will not so
much as bring it to his mouth
the wicked man being scourged the fool shall be wiser but if
thou rebuke a wise man he will understand discipline
he that afflicteth his father and chaseth away his mother is
infamous and unhappy
cease not o my son to hear instruction and be not ignorant of
the words of knowledge
an unjust witness scorneth judgment and the mouth of the wicked
devoureth iniquity
judgments are prepared for scorners and striking hammers for the
bodies of fools
wine is a luxurious thing and drunkenness riotous whosoever is
delighted therewith shall not be wise
as the roaring of a lion so also is the dread of a king he that
provoketh him sinneth against his own soul
it is an honour for a man to separate himself from quarrels but
all fools are meddling with reproaches
because of the cold the sluggard would not plough he shall beg
therefore in the summer and it shall not be given him
counsel in the heart of a man is like deep water but a wise man
will draw it out
many men are called merciful but who shall find a faithful man
the just that walketh in his simplicity shall leave behind him
blessed children
the king that sitteth on the throne of judgment scattereth away
all evil with his look
who can say my heart is clean i am pure from sin
diverse weights and diverse measures both are abominable before
by his inclinations a child is known if his works be clean and
right
the hearing ear and the seeing eye the lord hath made them
both
love not sleep lest poverty oppress thee open thy eyes and be
filled with bread
it is naught it is naught saith every buyer and when he is
gone away then he will boast
there is gold and a multitude of jewels but the lips of
knowledge are a precious vessel
take away the garment of him that is surety for a stranger and
take a pledge from him for strangers
the bread of lying is sweet to a man but afterwards his mouth
shall be filled with gravel
designs are strengthened by counsels and wars are to be managed
by governments
meddle not with him that revealeth secrets and walketh
deceitfully and openeth wide his lips
he that curseth his father and mother his lamp shall be put out
in the midst of darkness
the inheritance gotten hastily in the beginning in the end shall
be without a blessing
say not i will return evil wait for the lord and he will
deliver thee
diverse weights are an abomination before the lord a deceitful
balance is not good
the steps of men are guided by the lord but who is the man that
can understand his own way
it is ruin to a man to devour holy ones and after vows to
retract
a wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth over them the
wheel
the spirit of a man is the lamp of the lord which searcheth all
the hidden things of the bowels
mercy and truth preserve the king and his throne is strengthened
by clemency
the joy of young men is their strength and the dignity of old
men their grey hairs
the blueness of a wound shall wipe away evils and stripes in the
more inward parts of the belly
as the divisions of waters so the heart of the king is in the
hand of the lord whithersoever he will he shall turn it
every way of a man seemeth right to himself but the lord weigheth
the hearts
to do mercy and judgment pleaseth the lord more than victims
haughtiness of the eyes is the enlarging of the heart the lamp of
the wicked is sin
the thoughts of the industrious always bring forth abundance but
every sluggard is always in want
he that gathereth treasures by a lying tongue is vain and
foolish and shall stumble upon the snares of death
the robberies of the wicked shall be their downfall because they
would not do judgment
the perverse way of a man is strange but as for him that is pure
his work is right
it is better to sit in a corner of the housetop than with a
brawling woman and in a common house
the soul of the wicked desireth evil he will not have pity on
his neighbour
when a pestilent man is punished the little one will be wiser
and if he follow the wise he will receive knowledge
the just considereth seriously the house of the wicked that he
may withdraw the wicked from evil
he that stoppeth his ear against the cry of the poor shall also
cry himself and shall not be heard
a secret present quencheth anger and a gift in the bosom the
greatest wrath
it is joy to the just to do judgment and dread to them that work
iniquity
a man that shall wander out of the way of doctrine shall abide
in the company of the giants
he that loveth good cheer shall be in want he that loveth wine
and fat things shall not be rich
the wicked is delivered up for the just and the unjust for the
righteous
it is better to dwell in a wilderness than with a quarrelsome
and passionate woman
there is a treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
just and the foolish man shall spend it
he that followeth justice and mercy shall find life justice
and glory
the wise man hath scaled the city of the strong and hath cast
down the strength of the confidence thereof
he that keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
distress
the proud and the arrogant is called ignorant who in anger
worketh pride
desires kill the slothful for his hands have refused to work at
all
he longeth and desireth all the day but he that is just will
give and will not cease
the sacrifices of the wicked are abominable because they are
offered of wickedness
a lying witness shall perish an obedient man shall speak of
victory
the wicked man impudently hardeneth his face but he that is
righteous correcteth his way
there is no wisdom there is no prudence there is no counsel
against the lord
the horse is prepared for the day of battle but the lord giveth
safety
a good name is better than great riches and good favour is above
silver and gold
the rich and poor have met one another the lord is the maker of
them both
the prudent man saw the evil and hid himself the simple passed
on and suffered loss
the fruit of humility is the fear of the lord riches and glory
and life
arms and swords are in the way of the perverse but he that
keepeth his own soul departeth far from them
it is a proverb a young man according to his way even when he is
old he will not depart from it
the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to him
that lendeth
he that soweth iniquity shall reap evils and with the rod of his
anger he shall be consumed
he that is inclined to mercy shall be blessed for of his bread
he hath given to the poor he that maketh presents shall purchase
victory and honour but he carrieth away the souls of the receivers
cast out the scoffer and contention shall go out with him and
quarrels and reproaches shall cease
he that loveth cleanness of heart for the grace of his lips
shall have the king for his friend
the eyes of the lord preserve knowledge and the words of the
unjust are overthrown
the slothful man saith there is a lion without i shall be slain
in the midst of the streets
the mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit he whom the lord is
angry with shall fall into it
folly is bound up in the heart of a child and the rod of
correction shall drive it away
he that oppresseth the poor to increase his own riches shall
himself give to one that is richer and shall be in need
incline thy ear and hear the words of the wise and apply thy
heart to my doctrine
which shall be beautiful for thee if thou keep it in thy bowels
and it shall flow in thy lips
that thy trust may be in the lord wherefore i have also shewn it
to thee this day
behold i have described it to thee three manner of ways in
thoughts and knowledge
that i might shew thee the certainty and the words of truth to
answer out of these to them that sent thee
do no violence to the poor because he is poor and do not
oppress the needy in the gate
because the lord will judge his cause and will afflict them that
have afflicted his soul
be not a friend to an angry man and do not walk with a furious
man
lest perhaps thou learn his ways and take scandal to thy soul
be not with them that fasten down their hands and that offer
themselves sureties for debts
for if thou have not wherewith to restore what cause is there
that he should take the covering from thy bed
pass not beyond the ancient bounds which thy fathers have set
hast thou seen a man swift in his work he shall stand before
kings and shall not be before those that are obscure
when thou shalt sit to eat with a prince consider diligently what
is set before thy face
and put a knife to thy throat if it be so that thou have thy soul
in thy own power
be not desirous of his meats in which is the bread of deceit
labour not to be rich but set bounds to thy prudence
lift not up thy eyes to riches which thou canst not have because
they shall make themselves wings like those of an eagle and shall fly
towards heaven
eat not with an envious man and desire not his meats
because like a soothsayer and diviner he thinketh that which he
knoweth not eat and drink will he say to thee and his mind is not
with thee
the meats which thou hadst eaten thou shalt vomit up and shalt
loose thy beautiful words
speak not in the ears of fools because they will despise the
instruction of thy speech
touch not the bounds of little ones and enter not into the field
of the fatherless
for their near kinsman is strong and he will judge their cause
against thee
let thy heart apply itself to instruction and thy ears to words
of knowledge
withhold not correction from a child for if thou strike him with
the rod he shall not die
thou shalt beat him with the rod and deliver his soul from hell
my son if thy mind be wise my heart shall rejoice with thee
and my reins shall rejoice when thy lips shall speak what is
right
let not thy heart envy sinners but be thou in the fear of the
because thou shalt have hope in the latter end and thy
expectation shall not be taken away
hear thou my son and be wise and guide thy mind in the way
be not in the feasts of great drinkers nor in their revellings
who contribute flesh to eat
because they that give themselves to drinking and that club
together shall be consumed and drowsiness shall be clothed with rags
hearken to thy father that begot thee and despise not thy
mother when she is old
buy truth and do not sell wisdom and instruction and
understanding
the father of the just rejoiceth greatly he that hath begotten a
wise son shall have joy in him
let thy father and thy mother be joyful and let her rejoice that
bore thee
my son give me thy heart and let thy eyes keep my ways
for a harlot is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow
pit
she lieth in wait in the way as a robber and him whom she shall
see unwary she will kill
who hath woe whose father hath woe who hath contentions who
falls into pits who hath wounds without cause who hath redness of
eyes
surely they that pass their time in wine and study to drink off
their cups
look not upon the wine when it is yellow when the colour thereof
shineth in the glass it goeth in pleasantly
but in the end it will bite like a snake and will spread abroad
poison like a basilisk
thy eyes shall behold strange women and thy heart shall utter
perverse things
and thou shalt be as one sleeping in the midst of the sea and as
a pilot fast asleep when the stern is lost
and thou shalt say they have beaten me but i was not sensible
of pain they drew me and i felt not when shall i awake and find wine
again
seek not to be like evil men neither desire to be with them
because their mind studieth robberies and their lips speak
deceits
by wisdom the house shall be built and by prudence it shall be
strengthened
by instruction the storerooms shall be filled with all precious
and most beautiful wealth
a wise man is strong and a knowing man stout and valiant
because war is managed by due ordering and there shall be safety
where there are many counsels
wisdom is too high for a fool in the gate he shall not open his
mouth
he that deviseth to do evils shall be called a fool
the thought of a fool is sin and the detractor is the abomination
of men
if thou lose hope being weary in the day of distress thy
strength shall be diminished
deliver them that are led to death and those that are drawn to
death forbear not to deliver
if thou say i have not strength enough he that seeth into the
heart he understandeth and nothing deceiveth the keeper of thy soul
and he shall render to a man according to his works
eat honey my son because it is good and the honeycomb most
sweet to thy throat
so also is the doctrine of wisdom to thy soul which when thou
hast found thou shalt have hope in the end and thy hope shall not
perish
lie not in wait nor seek after wickedness in the house of the
just nor spoil his rest
for a just man shall fall seven times and shall rise again but
the wicked shall fall down into evil
when thy enemy shall fall be not glad and in his ruin let not
thy heart rejoice
lest the lord see and it displease him and he turn away his
wrath from him
contend not with the wicked nor seek to be like the ungodly
for evil men have no hope of things to come and the lamp of the
wicked shall be put out
my son fear the lord and the king and have nothing to do with
detractors
for their destruction shall rise suddenly and who knoweth the
ruin of both
these things also to the wise it is not good to have respect to
persons in judgment
they that say to the wicked man thou art just shall be cursed
by the people and the tribes shall abhor them
they that rebuke him shall be praised and a blessing shall come
upon them
he shall kiss the lips who answereth right words
prepare thy work without and diligently till thy ground that
afterward thou mayst build thy house
be not witness without cause against thy neighbour and deceive
not any man with thy lips
say not i will do to him as he hath done to me i will render to
every one according to his work
i passed by the field of the slothful man and by the vineyard of
the foolish man
and behold it was all filled with nettles and thorns had covered
the face thereof and the stone wall was broken down
which when i had seen i laid it up in my heart and by the
example i received instruction
thou wilt sleep a little said i thou wilt slumber a little
thou wilt fold thy hands a little to rest
and poverty shall come to thee as a runner and beggary as an
armed man
these are also parables of solomon which the men of ezechias
king of juda copied out
it is the glory of god to conceal the word and the glory of kings
to search out the speech
the heaven above and the earth beneath and the heart of kings is
unsearchable
take away the rust from silver and there shall come forth a most
pure vessel
take away wickedness from the face of the king and his throne
shall be established with justice
appear not glorious before the king and stand not in the place of
great men
for it is better that it should be said to thee come up hither
than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince
the things which thy eyes have seen utter not hastily in a
quarrel lest afterward thou mayst not be able to make amends when thou
hast dishonoured thy friend
treat thy cause with thy friend and discover not the secret to a
stranger
lest he insult over thee when he hath heard it and cease not to
upbraid thee grace and friendship deliver a man keep these for
thyself lest thou fall under reproach
to speak a word in due time is like apples of gold on beds of
silver
as an earring of gold and a bright pearl so is he that reproveth
the wise and the obedient ear
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest so is a faithful
messenger to him that sent him for he refresheth his soul
as clouds and wind when no rain followeth so is the man that
boasteth and doth not fulfil his promises
by patience a prince shall be appeased and a soft tongue shall
break hardness
thou hast found honey eat what is sufficient for thee lest
being glutted therewith thou vomit it up
withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour lest having
his fill he hate thee
a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is like a
dart and a sword and a sharp arrow
to trust in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble is like a
rotten tooth and weary foot
and one that looseth his garment in cold weather as vinegar upon
nitre so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart as a moth doth
by a garment and a worm by the wood so the sadness of a man consumeth
the heart
if thy enemy be hungry give him to eat if he thirst give him
water to drink
for thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head and the lord will
reward thee
the north wind driveth away rain as doth a sad countenance a
backbiting tongue
it is better to sit in a corner of the housetop than with a
brawling woman and in a common house
as cold water to a thirsty soul so are good tidings from a far
country
a just man falling down before the wicked is as a fountain
troubled with the foot and a corrupted spring
as it is not good for a man to eat much honey so he that is a
searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory
exposing our weak understanding to be blinded with an excess of light
and glory which it cannot comprehend
as a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls so is
a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking
as snow in summer and rain in harvest so glory is not seemly for
a fool
as a bird flying to other places and a sparrow going here or
there so a curse uttered without cause shall come upon a man
shall do no harm to the person that is cursed but will return upon him
that curseth as whithersoever a bird flies it returns to its own nest
a whip for a horse and a snaffle for an ass and a rod for the
back of fools
answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou be made like
him
reprove his folly
answer a fool according to his folly lest he imagine himself to
be wise
he that sendeth words by a foolish messenger is lame of feet and
drinketh iniquity
as a lame man hath fair legs in vain so a parable is unseemly in
the mouth of fools
as he that casteth a stone into the heap of mercury so is he that
giveth honour to a fool
as if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard so is a
parable in the mouth of fools
judgment determineth causes and he that putteth a fool to
silence appeaseth anger
as a dog that returneth to his vomit so is the fool that
repeateth his folly
hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit there shall be
more hope of a fool than of him
the slothful man saith there is a lion in the way and a lioness
in the roads
as the door turneth upon its hinges so doth the slothful upon
his bed
the slothful hideth his hand under his armpit and it grieveth
him to turn it to his mouth
the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that
speak sentences
as he that taketh a dog by the ears so is he that passeth by in
anger and meddleth with another mans quarrel
as he is guilty that shooteth arrows and lances unto death
so is the man that hurteth his friend deceitfully and when he is
taken saith i did it in jest
when the wood faileth the fire shall go out and when the
talebearer is taken away contentions shall cease
as coals are to burning coals and wood to fire so an angry man
stirreth up strife
the words of a talebearer are as it were simple but they reach
to the innermost parts of the belly
swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart are like an earthern
vessel adorned with silver dross
an enemy is known by his lips when in his heart he entertaineth
deceit
when he shall speak low trust him not because there are seven
mischiefs in his heart
he that covereth hatred deceitfully his malice shall be laid
open in the public assembly
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and he that rolleth a
stone it shall return to him
a deceitful tongue loveth not truth and a slippery mouth worketh
ruin
boast not for to morrow for thou knowest not what the day to come
may bring forth
let another praise thee and not thy own mouth a stranger and
not thy own lips
a stone is heavy and sand weighty but the anger of a fool is
heavier than them both
anger hath no mercy nor fury when it breaketh forth and who can
bear the violence of one provoked
open rebuke is better than hidden love
better are the wounds of a friend than the deceitful kisses of an
enemy
a soul that is full shall tread upon the honeycomb and a soul
that is hungry shall take even bitter for sweet
as a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that leaveth
his place
ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart and the good counsels of
a friend are sweet to the soul
thy own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not and go not
into thy brothers house in the day of thy affliction better is a
neighbour that is near than a brother afar off
study wisdom my son and make my heart joyful that thou mayst
give an answer to him that reproacheth
the prudent man seeing evil hideth himself little ones passing
on have suffered losses
take away his garment that hath been surety for a stranger and
take from him a pledge for strangers
he that blesseth his neighbour with a loud voice rising in the
night shall be like to him that curseth
roofs dropping through in a cold day and a contentious woman are
alike
he that retaineth her is as he that would hold the wind and
shall call the oil of his right hand
iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend
he that keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof and he
that is the keeper of his master shall be glorified
as the faces of them that look therein shine in the water so
the hearts of men are laid open to the wise
hell and destruction are never filled so the eyes of men are
never satisfied
as silver is tried in the finingpot and gold in the furnace so
a man is tried by the mouth of him that praiseth the heart of the
wicked seeketh after evils but the righteous heart seeketh after
knowledge
though thou shouldst bray a fool in the mortar as when a pestle
striketh upon sodden barley his folly would not be taken from him
be diligent to know the countenance of thy cattle and consider
thy own flocks
for thou shalt not always have power but a crown shall be given
to generation and generation
the meadows are open and the green herbs have appeared and the
hay is gathered out of the mountains
lambs are for thy clothing and kids for the price of the field
let the milk of the goats be enough for thy food and for the
necessities of thy house and for maintenance for thy handmaids
the wicked man fleeth when no man pursueth but the just bold as
a lion shall be without dread
for the sins of the land many are the princes thereof and for the
wisdom of a man and the knowledge of those things that are said the
life of the prince shall be prolonged
a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a violent shower
which bringeth a famine
they that forsake the law praise the wicked man they that keep
it are incensed against him
evil men think not on judgment but they that seek after the lord
take notice of all things
better is the poor man walking in his simplicity than the rich in
crooked ways
he that keepeth the law is a wise son but he that feedeth
gluttons shameth his father
he that heapeth together riches by usury and loan gathereth them
for him that will be bountiful to the poor
he that turneth away his ears from hearing the law his prayer
shall be an abomination
he that deceiveth the just in a wicked way shall fall in his own
destruction and the upright shall possess his goods
the rich man seemeth to himself wise but the poor man that is
prudent shall search him out
in the joy of the just there is great glory when the wicked
reign men are ruined
he that hideth his sins shall not prosper but he that shall
confess and forsake them shall obtain mercy
blessed is the man that is always fearful but he that is
hardened in mind shall fall into evil
as a roaring lion and a hungry bear so is a wicked prince over
the poor people
a prince void of prudence shall oppress many by calumny but he
that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days
a man that doth violence to the blood of a person if he flee
even to the pit no man will stay him
he that walketh uprightly shall be saved he that is perverse in
his ways shall fall at once
he that tilleth his ground shall be filled with bread but he
that followeth idleness shall be filled with poverty
a faithful man shall be much praised but he that maketh haste to
be rich shall not be innocent
he that hath respect to a person in judgment doth not well such
a man even for a morsel of bread forsaketh the truth
a man that maketh haste to be rich and envieth others is
ignorant that poverty shall come upon him
he that rebuketh a man shall afterward find favour with him
more than he that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him
he that stealeth any thing from his father or from his mother
and saith this is no sin is the partner of a murderer
he that boasteth and puffeth up himself stirreth up quarrels
but he that trusteth in the lord shall be healed
he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but he that walketh
wisely he shall be saved
he that giveth to the poor shall not want he that despiseth his
entreaty shall suffer indigence
when the wicked rise up men shall hide themselves when they
perish the just shall be multiplied
the man that with a stiff neck despiseth him that reproveth him
shall suddenly be destroyed and health shall not follow him
when just men increase the people shall rejoice when the wicked
shall bear rule the people shall mourn
a man that loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father but he that
maintaineth harlots shall squander away his substance
a just king setteth up the land a covetous man shall destroy it
a man that speaketh to his friend with flattering and dissembling
words spreadeth a net for his feet
a snare shall entangle the wicked man when he sinneth and the
just shall praise and rejoice
the just taketh notice of the cause of the poor the wicked is
void of knowledge
corrupt men bring a city to ruin but wise men turn away wrath
if a wise man contend with a fool whether he be angry or laugh
he shall find no rest
bloodthirsty men hate the upright but just men seek his soul
a fool uttereth all his mind a wise man deferreth and keepeth
it till afterwards
a prince that gladly heareth lying words hath all his servants
wicked
the poor man and the creditor have met one another the lord is
the enlightener of them both
the king that judgeth the poor in truth his throne shall be
established for ever
the rod and reproof give wisdom but the child that is left to
his own will bringeth his mother to shame
when the wicked are multiplied crimes shall be multiplied but
the just shall see their downfall
instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give
delight to thy soul
when prophecy shall fail the people shall be scattered abroad
but he that keepeth the law is blessed
a slave will not be corrected by words because he understandeth
what thou sayest and will not answer
hast thou seen a man hasty to speak folly is rather to be looked
for than his amendment
he that nourisheth his servant delicately from his childhood
afterwards shall find him stubborn
a passionate man provoketh quarrels and he that is easily
stirred up to wrath shall be more prone to sin
humiliation followeth the proud and glory shall uphold the
humble of spirit
he that is partaker with a thief hateth his own soul he heareth
one putting him to his oath and discovereth not
he that feareth man shall quickly fall he that trusteth in the
many seek the face of the prince but the judgment of every one
cometh forth from the lord
the just abhor a wicked man and the wicked loathe them that are
in the right way the son that keepeth the word shall be free from
destruction
certain virtues and vices
the words of gatherer the son of vomiter the vision which the man
spoke with whom god is and who being strengthened by god abiding with
him said
signification of the hebrew names instead of the names themselves
which are in the hebrew agur the son of jakeh but whether this agur be
the same person as solomon as many think or a different person whose
doctrine was adopted by solomon and inserted among his parables or
proverbs is uncertain
i am the most foolish of men and the wisdom of men is not with
me
i have not learned wisdom and have not known the science of
saints
who hath ascended up into heaven and descended who hath held
the wind in his hands who hath bound up the waters together as in a
garment who hath raised up all the borders of the earth what is his
name and what is the name of his son if thou knowest
every word of god is fire tried he is a buckler to them that hope
in him
add not any thing to his words lest thou be reproved and found a
liar
two things i have asked of thee deny them not to me before i die
remove far from me vanity and lying words give me neither
beggary nor riches give me only the necessaries of life
lest perhaps being filled i should be tempted to deny and say
forswear the name of my god
accuse not a servant to his master lest he curse thee and thou
fall
there is a generation that curseth their father and doth not
bless their mother
a generation that are pure in their own eyes and yet are not
washed from their filthiness
a generation whose eyes are lofty and their eyelids lifted up
on high
a generation that for teeth hath swords and grindeth with their
jaw teeth to devour the needy from off the earth and the poor from
among men
the horseleech hath two daughters that say bring bring there
are three things that never are satisfied and the fourth never saith
satisfied viz lust and avarice
hell and the mouth of the womb and the earth which is not
satisfied with water and the fire never saith it is enough
the eye that mocketh at his father and that despiseth the labour
of his mother in bearing him let the ravens of the brooks pick it out
and the young eagles eat it
three things are hard to me and the fourth i am utterly ignorant
of
the way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock
the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man in
youth
such also is the way of an adulterous woman who eateth and
wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no evil
by three things the earth is disturbed and the fourth it cannot
bear
by a slave when he reigneth by a fool when he is filled with
meat
by an odious woman when she is married and by a bondwoman when
she is heir to her mistress
there are four very little things of the earth and they are
wiser than the wise
the ants a feeble people which provide themselves food in the
harvest
the rabbit a weak people which maketh its bed in the rock
the locust hath no king yet they all go out by their bands
the stellio supporteth itself on hands and dwelleth in kings
houses
whence it has its name
there are three things which go well and the fourth that
walketh happily
a lion the strongest of beasts who hath no fear of any thing he
meeteth
a cock girded about the loins and a ram and a king whom none
can resist
there is that hath appeared a fool after he was lifted up on
high for if he had understood he would have laid his hand upon his
mouth
and he that strongly squeezeth the paps to bring out milk
straineth out butter and he that violently bloweth his nose bringeth
out blood and he that provoketh wrath bringeth forth strife
praise of a wise woman
the words of king lamuel the vision wherewith his mother
instructed him
one of the names of solomon
what o my beloved what o the beloved of my womb what o the
beloved of my vows
give not thy substance to women and thy riches to destroy kings
give not to kings o lamuel give not wine to kings because there
is no secret where drunkenness reigneth
and lest they drink and forget judgments and pervert the cause of
the children of the poor
give strong drink to them that are sad and wine to them that are
grieved in mind
let them drink and forget their want and remember their sorrow
no more
open thy mouth for the dumb and for the causes of all the
children that pass
open thy mouth decree that which is just and do justice to the
needy and poor
who shall find a valiant woman far and from the uttermost
coasts is the price of her
the heart of her husband trusteth in her and he shall have no
need of spoils
she will render him good and not evil all the days of her life
she hath sought wool and flax and hath wrought by the counsel of
her hands
she is like the merchants ship she bringeth her bread from
afar
and she hath risen in the night and given a prey to her
household and victuals to her maidens
she hath considered a field and bought it with the fruit of her
hands she hath planted a vineyard
she hath girded her loins with strength and hath strengthened
her arm
she hath tasted and seen that her traffic is good her lamp
shall not be put out in the night
she hath put out her hand to strong things and her fingers have
taken hold of the spindle
she hath opened her hand to the needy and stretched out her
hands to the poor
she shall not fear for her house in the cold of snow for all her
domestics are clothed with double garments
she hath made for herself clothing of tapestry fine linen and
purple is her covering
her husband is honourable in the gates when he sitteth among the
senators of the land
she made fine linen and sold it and delivered a girdle to the
merchant
strength and beauty are her clothing and she shall laugh in the
latter day
she hath opened her mouth to wisdom and the law of clemency is
on her tongue
she hath looked well on the paths of her house and hath not
eaten her bread idle
her children rose up and called her blessed her husband and he
praised her
many daughters have gathered together riches thou hast surpassed
them all
favour is deceitful and beauty is vain the woman that feareth
the lord she shall be praised
give her of the fruit of her hands and let her works praise her
in the gates
forth the vanity of the things of this world to withdraw the hearts and
affections of men from such empty toys
