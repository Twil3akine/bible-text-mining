murmuring and their punishment
these are the words which moses spoke to all israel beyond the
gold
eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mount seir to
in the fortieth year the eleventh month the first day of the
month moses spoke to the children of israel all that the lord had
commanded him to say to them
after that he had slain sehon king of the amorrhites who dwelt in
beyond the jordan in the land of moab and moses began to expound
the law and to say
the lord our god spoke to us in horeb saying you have stayed long
enough in this mountain
turn you and come to the mountain of the amorrhites and to the
other places that are next to it the plains and the hills and the vales
towards the south and by the sea shore the land of the chanaanites
and of libanus as far as the great river euphrates
behold said he i have delivered it to you go in and possess it
concerning which the lord swore to your fathers abraham isaac and
and i said to you at that time
i alone am not able to bear you for the lord your god hath
multiplied you and you are this day as the stars of heaven for
multitude
the lord god of your fathers add to this number many thousands
and bless you as he hath spoken
i alone am not able to bear your business and the charge of you
and your differences
let me have from among you wise and understanding men and such
whose conversation is approved among your tribes that i may appoint
them your rulers
then you answered me the thing is good which thou meanest to do
and i took out of your tribes men wise and honourable and
appointed them rulers tribunes and centurions and officers over
fifties and over tens who might teach you all things
and i commanded them saying hear them and judge that which is
just whether he be one of your country or a stranger
there shall be no difference of persons you shall hear the little
as well as the great neither shall you respect any mans person
because it is the judgment of god and if any thing seem hard to you
refer it to me and i will hear it
and i commanded you all things that you were to do
and departing from horeb we passed through the terrible and vast
wilderness which you saw by the way of the mountain of the amorrhite
as the lord our god had commanded us and when we were come into
i said to you you are come to the mountain of the amorrhite
which the lord our god will give to us
see the land which the lord thy god giveth thee go up and possess
it as the lord our god hath spoken to thy fathers fear not nor be any
way discouraged
and you came all to me and said let us send men who may view the
land and bring us word what way we shall go up and to what cities we
shall go
and because the saying pleased me i sent of you twelve men one
of every tribe
who when they had set forward and had gone up to the mountains
came as far as the valley of the cluster and having viewed the land
taking of the fruits thereof to shew its fertility they brought
them to us and said the land is good which the lord our god will give
us
and you would not go up but being incredulous to the word of the
you murmured in your tents and said the lord hateth us and
therefore he hath brought us out of the land of egypt that he might
deliver us into the hand of the amorrhite and destroy us
whither shall we go up the messengers have terrified our hearts
saying the multitude is very great and taller than we the cities are
great and walled up to the sky we have seen the sons of the enacims
there
be very high
and i said to you fear not neither be ye afraid of them
the lord god who is your leader himself will fight for you as
he did in egypt in the sight of all
and in the wilderness as thou hast seen the lord thy god hath
carried thee as a man is wont to carry his little son all the way that
you have come until you came to this place
and yet for all this you did not believe the lord your god
who went before you in the way and marked out the place wherein
you should pitch your tents in the night shewing you the way by fire
and in the day by the pillar of a cloud
and when the lord had heard the voice of your words he was angry
and swore and said
not one of the men of this wicked generation shall see the good
land which i promised with an oath to your fathers
except caleb the son of jephone for he shall see it and to him i
will give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children
because he hath followed the lord
neither is his indignation against the people to be wondered at
since the lord was angry with me also on your account and said neither
shalt thou go in thither
but josue the son of nun thy minister he shall go in for thee
exhort and encourage him and he shall divide the land by lot to israel
your children of whom you said that they should be led away
captives and your sons who know not this day the difference of good and
evil they shall go in and to them i will give the land and they shall
possess it
but return you and go into the wilderness by the way of the red
and you answered me we have sinned against the lord we will go
up and fight as the lord our god hath commanded and when you went
ready armed unto the mountain
the lord said to me say to them go not up and fight not for i
am not with you lest you fall before your enemies
i spoke and you hearkened not but resisting the commandment of
the lord and swelling with pride you went up into the mountain
and the amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains coming out and
meeting you chased you as bees do and made slaughter of you from seir
as far as horma
and when you returned and wept before the lord he heard you not
neither would he yield to your voice
so you abode in cadesbarne a long time
and departing from thence we came into the wilderness that leadeth
to the red sea as the lord had spoken to me and we compassed mount
and the lord said to me
you have compassed this mountain long enough go toward the north
and command thou the people saying you shall pass by the borders
of your brethren the children of esau who dwell in seir and they will
be afraid of you
take ye then good heed that you stir not against them for i will
not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread
upon because i have given mount seir to esau for a possession
you shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat you shall draw
waters for money and shall drink
the lord thy god hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands the
passed through this great wilderness for forty years and thou hast
wanted nothing
and when we had passed by our brethren the children of esau that
dwelt in seir by the way of the plain from elath and from asiongaber
we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of moab
and the lord said to me fight not against the moabites neither go
to battle against them for i will not give thee any of their land
because i have given ar to the children of lot in possession
the emims first were the inhabitants thereof a people great and
strong and so tall that like the race of the enacims
they were esteemed as giants and were like the sons of the
the horrhites also formerly dwelt in seir who being driven out
and destroyed the children of esau dwelt there as israel did in the
land of his possession which the lord gave him
then rising up to pass the torrent zared we came to it
and the time that we journeyed from cadesbarne till we passed over
the torrent zared was thirtyeight years until all the generation of
the men that were fit for war was consumed out of the camp as the lord
had sworn
for his hand was against them that they should perish from the
midst of the camp
and after all the fighting men were dead
the lord spoke to me saying
thou shalt pass this day the borders of moab the city named ar
and when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the children of ammon
take heed thou fight not against them nor once move to battle for i
will not give thee of the land of the children of ammon because i have
given it to the children of lot for a possession
it was accounted a land of giants and giants formerly dwelt in
it whom the ammonites call zomzommims
a people great and many and of tall stature like the enacims
whom the lord destroyed before their face and he made them to dwell in
their stead
as he had done in favour of the children of esau that dwell in
they possess to this day
the hevites also that dwelt in haserim as far as gaza were
expelled by the cappadocians who came out of cappadocia and destroyed
them and dwelt in their stead
arise ye and pass the torrent arnon behold i have delivered into
thy hand sehon king of hesebon the amorrhite and begin thou to possess
his land and make war against him
this day will i begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the
nations that dwell under the whole heaven that when they hear thy name
they may fear and tremble and be in pain like women in travail
so i sent messengers from the wilderness of cademoth to sehon the
king of hesebon with peaceable words saying
we will pass through thy land we will go along by the highway we
will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left
sell us meat for money that we may eat give us water for money
and so we will drink we only ask that thou wilt let us pass through
as the children of esau have done that dwell in seir and the
land which the lord our god will give us
and sehon the king of hesebon would not let us pass because the
be delivered into thy hands as now thou seest
his own stubborn and perverse disposition which drew him to his ruin
and the lord said to me behold i have begun to deliver unto thee
and sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at
and the lord our god delivered him to us and we slew him with his
sons and all his people
and we took all his cities at that time killing the inhabitants
of them men and women and children we left nothing of them
except the cattle which came to the share of them that took them
and the spoils of the cities which we took
from aroer which is upon the bank of the torrent arnon a town
that is situate in a valley as far as galaad there was not a village
or city that escaped our hands the lord our god delivered all unto us
except the land of the children of ammon to which we approached
not and all that border upon the torrent jeboc and the cities in the
mountains and all the places which the lord our god forbade us
then we turned and went by the way of basan and og the king of
and the lord said to me fear him not because he is delivered into
thy hand with all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as
thou hast done to sehon king of the amorrhites that dwelt in hesebon
so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also the king of
wasting all his cities at one time there was not a town that
escaped us sixty cities all the country of argob the kingdom of og in
all the cities were fenced with very high walls and with gates and
bars besides innumerable towns that had no walls
and we utterly destroyed them as we had done to sehon the king of
but the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey
and we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings
of the amorrhites that were beyond the jordan from the torrent arnon
unto the mount hermon
which the sidonians call sarion and the amorrhites sanir
all the cities that are situate in the plain and all the land of
in basan
for only og king of basan remained of the race of the giants his
bed of iron is shewn which is in rabbath of the children of ammon
being nine cubits long and four broad after the measure of the cubit of
a mans hand
and we possessed the land at that time from aroer which is upon
the bank of the torrent arnon unto the half of mount galaad and i gave
the cities thereof to ruben and gad
and i delivered the other part of galaad and all basan the
kingdom of og to the half tribe of manasses all the country of argob
and all basan is called the land of giants
jair the son of manasses possessed all the country of argob unto
the borders of gessuri and machati and he called basan by his own
name havoth jair that is to say the towns of jair until this present
day
to machir also i gave galaad
and to the tribes of ruben and gad i gave of the land of galaad as
far as the torrent arnon half the torrent and the confines even unto
the torrent jeboc which is the border of the children of ammon
and the plain of the wilderness and the jordan and the borders
of cenereth unto the sea of the desert which is the most salt sea to
the foot of mount phasga eastward
and i commanded you at that time saying the lord your god giveth
you this land for an inheritance go ye well appointed before your
brethren the children of israel all the strong men of you
leaving your wives and children and cattle for i know you have
much cattle and they must remain in the cities which i have delivered
to you
until the lord give rest to your brethren as he hath given to
you and they also possess the land which he will give them beyond the
given you
i commanded josue also at that time saying thy eyes have seen
what the lord your god hath done to these two kings so will he do to
all the kingdoms to which thou shalt pass
fear them not for the lord your god will fight for you
and i besought the lord at that time saying
lord god thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness
and most mighty hand for there is no other god either in heaven or
earth that is able to do thy works or to be compared to thy strength
i will pass over therefore and will see this excellent land
beyond the jordan and this goodly mountain and libanus
and the lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not
but said to me it is enough speak no more to me of this matter
go up to the top of phasga and cast thy eyes round about to the
west and to the north and to the south and to the east and behold
it for thou shalt not pass this jordan
command josue and encourage and strengthen him for he shall go
before this people and shall divide unto them the land which thou shalt
see
and we abode in the valley over against the temple of phogor
fly idolatry appointeth three cities of refuge on that side of the
and now o israel hear the commandments and judgments which i
teach thee that doing them thou mayst live and entering in mayst
possess the land which the lord the god of your fathers will give you
you shall not add to the word that i speak to you neither shall
you take away from it keep the commandments of the lord your god which
your eyes have seen all that the lord hath done against beelphegor
how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among you
but you that adhere to the lord your god are all alive until this
present day
you know that i have taught you statutes and justices as the lord
my god hath commanded me so shall you do them in the land which you
shall possess
and you shall observe and fulfil them in practice for this is
your wisdom and understanding in the sight of nations that hearing all
these precepts they may say behold a wise and understanding people a
great nation
neither is there any other nation so great that hath gods so nigh
them as our god is present to all our petitions
for what other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies
and just judgments and all the law which i will set forth this day
before our eyes
keep thyself therefore and thy soul carefully forget not the
words that thy eyes have seen and let them not go out of thy heart all
the days of thy life thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy
grandsons
from the day in which thou didst stand before the lord thy god in
me that they may hear my words and may learn to fear me all the time
that they live on the earth and may teach their children
and you came to the foot of the mount which burned even unto
heaven and there was darkness and a cloud and obscurity in it
and the lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire you heard
the voice of his words but you saw not any form at all
and he shewed you his covenant which he commanded you to do and
the ten words that he wrote in two tables of stone
and he commanded me at that time that i should teach you the
ceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land that you shall
possess
keep therefore your souls carefully you saw not any similitude in
the day that the lord god spoke to you in horeb from the midst of the
fire
lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven
similitude or image of male or female
the similitude of any beasts that are upon the earth or of
birds that fly under heaven
or of creeping things that move on the earth or of fishes that
abide in the waters under the earth
lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven thou see the sun and
the moon and all the stars of heaven and being deceived by error thou
adore and serve them which the lord thy god created for the service of
all the nations that are under heaven
but the lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron
furnaces of egypt to make you his people of inheritance as it is this
present day
and the lord was angry with me for your words and he swore that i
should not pass over the jordan nor enter into the excellent land
which he will give you
behold i die in this land i shall not pass over the jordan you
shall pass and possess the goodly land
beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the lord thy god
which he hath made with thee and make to thyself a graven likeness of
those things which the lord hath forbid to be made
because the lord thy god is a consuming fire a jealous god
if you shall beget sons and grandsons and abide in the land and
being deceived make to yourselves any similitude committing evil
before the lord your god to provoke him to wrath
i call this day heaven and earth to witness that you shall
quickly perish out of the land which when you have passed over the
and scatter you among all nations and you shall remain a few
among the nations to which the lord shall lead you
and there you shall serve gods that were framed with mens hands
wood and stone that neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell
and when thou shalt seek there the lord thy god thou shalt find
him yet so if thou seek him with all thy heart and all the affliction
of thy soul
after all the things aforesaid shall find thee in the latter time
thou shalt return to the lord thy god and shalt hear his voice
because the lord thy god is a merciful god he will not leave
thee nor altogether destroy thee nor forget the covenant by which he
swore to thy fathers
ask of the days of old that have been before thy time from the
day that god created man upon the earth from one end of heaven to the
other end thereof if ever there was done the like thing or it hath
been known at any time
that a people should hear the voice of god speaking out of the
midst of fire as thou hast heard and lived
if god ever did so as to go and take to himself a nation out of
the midst of nations by temptations signs and wonders by fight and a
strong hand and stretched out arm and horrible visions according to
all the things that the lord your god did for you in egypt before thy
eyes
that thou mightest know that the lord he is god and there is no
other besides him
from heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might teach
thee and upon earth he shewed thee his exceeding great fire and thou
didst hear his words out of the midst of the fire
because he loved thy fathers and chose their seed after them and
he brought thee out of egypt going before thee with his great power
to destroy at thy coming very great nations and stronger than
thou art and to bring thee in and give thee their land for a
possession as thou seest at this present day
know therefore this day and think in thy heart that the lord he
is god in heaven above and in the earth beneath and there is no other
keep his precepts and commandments which i command thee that it
may be well with thee and thy children after thee and thou mayst
remain a long time upon the land which the lord thy god will give thee
then moses set aside three cities beyond the jordan at the east
side
that any one might flee to them who should kill his neighbour
unwillingly and was not his enemy a day or two before and that he
might escape to some one of these cities
bosor in the wilderness which is situate in the plains of the
tribe of ruben and ramoth in galaad which is in the tribe of gad and
this is the law that moses set before the children of israel
and these are the testimonies and ceremonies and judgments which
he spoke to the children of israel when they came out of egypt
beyond the jordan in the valley over against the temple of phogor
in the land of sehon king of the amorrhites that dwelt in hesebon whom
possessed his land and the land of og king of basan of the two
kings of the amorrhites who were beyond the jordan towards the rising
of the sun
from aroer which is situate upon the bank of the torrent arnon
unto mount sion which is also called hermon
all the plain beyond the jordan at the east side unto the sea of
the wilderness and unto the foot of mount phasga
and moses called all israel and said to them hear o israel the
ceremonies and judgments which i speak in your ears this day learn
them and fulfil them in work
the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb
he made not the covenant with our fathers but with us who are now
present and living
he spoke to us face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire
i was the mediator and stood between the lord and you at that time
to shew you his words for you feared the fire and went not up into the
mountain and he said
i am the lord thy god who brought thee out of the land of egypt
out of the house of bondage
thou shalt not have strange gods in my sight
thou shalt not make to thy self a graven thing nor the likeness of
any things that are in heaven above or that are in the earth beneath
or that abide in the waters under the earth
thou shalt not adore them and thou shalt not serve them for i am
the lord thy god a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon their children unto the third and fourth generation to them that
hate me
and shewing mercy unto many thousands to them that love me and
keep my commandments
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for he
shall not be unpunished that taketh his name upon a vain thing
observe the day of the sabbath to sanctify it as the lord thy
six days shalt thou labour and shalt do all thy works
the seventh is the day of the sabbath that is the rest of the
thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy ox nor
thy ass nor any of thy beasts nor the stranger that is within thy
gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest even as
thyself
remember that thou also didst serve in egypt and the lord thy god
brought thee out from thence with a strong hand and a stretched out
arm therefore hath he commanded thee that thou shouldst observe the
sabbath day
honour thy father and mother as the lord thy god hath commanded
thee that thou mayst live a long time and it may be well with thee in
the land which the lord thy god will give thee
thou shalt not kill
neither shalt thou commit adultery
and thou shalt not steal
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour
thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife nor his house nor his
field nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass
nor any thing that is his
these words the lord spoke to all the multitude of you in the
mountain out of the midst of the fire and the cloud and the darkness
with a loud voice adding nothing more and he wrote them in two tables
of stone which he delivered unto me
but you after you heard the voice out of the midst of the
darkness and saw the mountain burn came to me all the princes of the
tribes and the elders and you said
behold the lord our god hath shewn us his majesty and his
greatness we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire and
have proved this day that god speaking with man man hath lived
why shall we die therefore and why shall this exceeding great
fire comsume us for if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more
we shall die
what is all flesh that it should hear the voice of the living
able to live
approach thou rather and hear all things that the lord our god
shall say to thee and thou shalt speak to us and we will hear and will
do them
and when the lord had heard this he said to me i have heard the
voice of the words of this people which they spoke to thee they have
spoken all things well
who shall give them to have such a mind to fear me and to keep
all my commandments at all times that it may be well with them and with
their children for ever
go and say to them return into your tents
but stand thou here with me and i will speak to thee all my
commandments and ceremonies and judgments which thou shalt teach them
that they may do them in the land which i will give them for a
possession
keep therefore and do the things which the lord god hath commanded
you you shall not go aside neither to the right hand nor to the left
but you shall walk in the way that the lord your god hath
commanded that you may live and it may be well with you and your days
may be long in the land of your possession
these are the precepts and ceremonies and judgments which the
them in the land into which you pass over to possess it
that thou mayst fear the lord thy god and keep all his
commandments and precepts which i command thee and thy sons and thy
grandsons all the days of thy life that thy days may be prolonged
hear o israel and observe to do the things which the lord hath
commanded thee that it may be well with thee and thou mayst be greatly
multiplied as the lord the god of thy fathers hath promised thee a land
flowing with milk and honey
hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
thou shalt love the lord thy god with thy whole heart and with thy
whole soul and with thy whole strength
and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thy
heart
and thou shalt tell them to thy children and thou shalt meditate
upon them sitting in thy house and walking on thy journey sleeping and
rising
and thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand and they shall be
and shall move between thy eyes
and thou shalt write them in the entry and on the doors of thy
house
and when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land
for which he swore to thy fathers abraham isaac and jacob and shall
have given thee great and goodly cities which thou didst not build
houses full of riches which thou didst not set up cisterns which
thou didst not dig vineyards and oliveyards which thou didst not
plant
and thou shalt have eaten and be full
take heed diligently lest thou forget the lord who brought thee
out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shalt fear
the lord thy god and shalt serve him only and thou shalt swear by his
name
you shall not go after the strange gods of all the nations that
are round about you
because the lord thy god is a jealous god in the midst of thee
lest at any time the wrath of the lord thy god be kindled against thee
and take thee away from the face of the earth
thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god as thou temptedst him in
the place of temptation
keep the precepts of the lord thy god and the testimonies and
ceremonies which he hath commanded thee
and do that which is pleasing and good in the sight of the lord
that it may be well with thee and going in thou mayst possess the
goodly land concerning which the lord swore to thy fathers
that he would destroy all thy enemies before thee as he hath
spoken
and when thy son shall ask thee to morrow saying what mean these
testimonies and ceremonies and judgments which the lord our god hath
commanded us
thou shalt say to him we were bondmen of pharao in egypt and the
and he wrought signs and wonders great and very grievous in egypt
against pharao and all his house in our sight
and he brought us out from thence that he might bring us in and
give us the land concerning which he swore to our fathers
and the lord commanded that we should do all these ordinances and
should fear the lord our god that it might be well with us all the days
of our life as it is at this day
and he will be merciful to us if we keep and do all his precepts
before the lord our god as he hath commanded us
his people his blessing and assistance if they keep his commandments
when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which
thou art going in to possess and shall have destroyed many nations
before thee the hethite and the gergezite and the amorrhite and the
nations much more numerous than thou art and stronger than thou
and the lord thy god shall have delivered them to thee thou shalt
utterly destroy them thou shalt make no league with them nor shew
mercy to them
neither shalt thou make marriages with them thou shalt not give
thy daughter to his son nor take his daughter for thy son
for she will turn away thy son from following me that he may
rather serve strange gods and the wrath of the lord will be kindled
and will quickly destroy thee
but thus rather shall you deal with them destroy their altars and
break their statues and cut down their groves and burn their graven
things
because thou art a holy people to the lord thy god the lord thy
upon the earth
not because you surpass all nations in number is the lord joined
unto you and hath chosen you for you are the fewest of any people
but because the lord hath loved you and hath kept his oath which
he swore to your fathers and hath brought you out with a strong hand
and redeemed you from the house of bondage out of the hand of pharao
the king of egypt
and thou shalt know that the lord thy god he is a strong and
faithful god keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him and
to them that keep his commandments unto a thousand generations
and repaying forthwith them that hate him so as to destroy them
without further delay immediately rendering to them what they deserve
keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies and judgments which i
command thee this day to do
if after thou hast heard these judgments thou keep and do them
the lord thy god will also keep his covenant to thee and the mercy
which he swore to thy fathers
and he will love thee and multiply thee and will bless the fruit
of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy corn and thy vintage thy
oil and thy herds and the flocks of thy sheep upon the land for which
he swore to thy fathers that he would give it thee
blessed shalt thou be among all people no one shall be barren
among you of either sex neither of men nor cattle
the lord will take away from thee all sickness and the grievous
infirmities of egypt which thou knowest he will not bring upon thee
but upon thy enemies
thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god will
deliver to thee thy eye shall not spare them neither shalt thou serve
their gods lest they be thy ruin
if thou say in thy heart these nations are more than i how shall
fear not but remember what the lord thy god did to pharao and to
all the egyptians
the exceeding great plagues which thy eyes saw and the signs and
wonders and the strong hand and the stretched out arm with which the
thou fearest
moreover the lord thy god will send also hornets among them until
he destroy and consume all that have escaped thee and could hide
themselves
thou shalt not fear them because the lord thy god is in the midst
of thee a god mighty and terrible
he will consume these nations in thy sight by little and little
and by degrees thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether lest
perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee
but the lord thy god shall deliver them in thy sight and shall
slay them until they be utterly destroyed
and he shall deliver their kings into thy hands and thou shalt
destroy their names from under heaven no man shall be able to resist
thee until thou destroy them
their graven things thou shalt burn with fire thou shalt not
covet the silver and gold of which they are made neither shalt thou
take to thee any thing thereof lest thou offend because it is an
abomination to the lord thy god
neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy house
lest thou become an anathema like it thou shalt detest it as dung and
shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth because it is an
anathema
they may love him and serve him
all the commandments that i command thee this day take great care
to observe that you may live and be multiplied and going in may
possess the land for which the lord swore to your fathers
and thou shalt remember all the way through which the lord thy god
hath brought thee for forty years through the desert to afflict thee
and to prove thee and that the things that were known in thy heart
might be made known whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no
he afflicted thee with want and gave thee manna for thy food
which neither thou nor thy fathers knew to shew that not in bread alone
doth man live but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of god
what he pleases for the support of man
thy raiment with which thou wast covered hath not decayed for
age and thy foot is not worn lo this is the fortieth year
that thou mayst consider in thy heart that as a man traineth up
his son so the lord thy god hath trained thee up
that thou shouldst keep the commandments of the lord thy god and
walk in his ways and fear him
for the lord thy god will bring thee into a good land of brooks
and of waters and of fountains in the plains of which and the hills
deep rivers break out
a land of wheat and barley and vineyards wherein fig trees and
pomegranates and oliveyards grow a land of oil and honey
where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread and enjoy
abundance of all things where the stones are iron and out of its hills
are dug mines of brass
that when thou hast eaten and art full thou mayst bless the lord
thy god for the excellent land which he hath given thee
take heed and beware lest at any time thou forget the lord thy
command thee this day
lest after thou hast eaten and art filled hast built goodly
houses and dwelt in them
and shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep and plenty of
gold and of silver and of all things
thy heart be lifted up and thou remember not the lord thy god
who brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage
and was thy leader in the great and terrible wilderness wherein
there was the serpent burning with his breath and the scorpion and the
dipsas and no waters at all who brought forth streams out of the
hardest rock
it has its name for in greek dipsa signifies thirst
and fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew
not and after he had afflicted and proved thee at the last he had
mercy on thee
lest thou shouldst say in thy heart my own might and the
strength of my own hand have achieved all these things for me
but remember the lord thy god that he hath given thee strength
that he might fulfil his covenant concerning which he swore to thy
fathers as this present day sheweth
but if thou forget the lord thy god and follow strange gods and
serve and adore them behold now i foretell thee that thou shalt utterly
perish
as the nations which the lord destroyed at thy entrance so shall
you also perish if you be disobedient to the voice of the lord your
put in mind of their manifold rebellions and other sins for which they
should have been destroyed but god spared them for his promise made to
hear o israel thou shalt go over the jordan this day to possess
nations very great and stronger than thyself cities great and walled
up to the sky
a people great and tall the sons of the enacims whom thou hast
seen and heard of against whom no man is able to stand
thou shalt know therefore this day that the lord thy god himself
will pass over before thee a devouring and consuming fire to destroy
and extirpate and bring them to nothing before thy face quickly as he
hath spoken to thee
say not in thy heart when the lord thy god shall have destroyed
them in thy sight for my justice hath the lord brought me in to possess
this land whereas these nations are destroyed for their wickedness
for it is not for thy justices and the uprightness of thy heart
that thou shalt go in to possess their lands but because they have done
wickedly they are destroyed at thy coming in and that the lord might
accomplish his word which he promised by oath to thy fathers abraham
know therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not this excellent
land in possession for thy justices for thou art a very stiffnecked
people
remember and forget not how thou provokedst the lord thy god to
wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou camest out of egypt unto
this place thou hast always strove against the lord
for in horeb also thou didst provoke him and he was angry and
would have destroyed thee
when i went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone the
tables of the covenant which the lord made with you and i continued in
the mount forty days and nights neither eating bread nor drinking
water
and the lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger
of god and containing all the words that he spoke to you in the mount
from the midst of the fire when the people were assembled together
and when forty days were passed and as many nights the lord gave
me the two tables of stone the tables of the covenant
and said to me arise and go down from hence quickly for thy
people which thou hast brought out of egypt have quickly forsaken the
way that thou hast shewn them and have made to themselves a molten
idol
and again the lord said to me i see that this people is
stiffnecked
let me alone that i may destroy them and abolish their name from
under heaven and set thee over a nation that is greater and stronger
than this
and when i came down from the burning mount and held the two
tables of the covenant with both hands
and saw that you had sinned against the lord your god and had
made to yourselves a molten calf and had quickly forsaken his way
which he had shewn you
i cast the tables out of my hands and broke them in your sight
and i fell down before the lord as before forty days and nights
neither eating bread nor drinking water for all your sins which you
had committed against the lord and had provoked him to wrath
for i feared his indignation and anger wherewith being moved
against you he would have destroyed you and the lord heard me this
time also
and he was exceeding angry against aaron also and would have
destroyed him and i prayed in like manner for him
and your sin that you had committed that is the calf i took
and burned it with fire and breaking it into pieces until it was as
small as dust i threw it into the torrent which cometh down from the
mountain
at the burning also and at the place of temptation and at the
graves of lust you provoked the lord
and when he sent you from cadesbarne saying go up and possess
the land that i have given you and you slighted the commandment of the
voice
but were always rebellious from the day that i began to know you
and i lay prostrate before the lord forty days and nights in
which i humbly besought him that he would not destroy you as he had
threatened
and praying i said o lord god destroy not thy people and thy
inheritance which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness whom thou hast
brought out of egypt with a strong hand
remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not on the
stubbornness of this people nor on their wickedness and sin
lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land out of which thou hast
brought us say the lord could not bring them into the land that he
promised them and he hated them therefore he brought them out that he
might kill them in the wilderness
who are thy people and thy inheritance whom thou hast brought out
by thy great strength and in thy stretched out arm
and serve the lord
at that time the lord said to me hew thee two tables of stone
like the former and come up to me into the mount and thou shalt make
an ark of wood
and i will write on the tables the words that were in them which
thou brokest before and thou shalt put them in the ark
and i made an ark of setim wood and when i had hewn two tables of
stone like the former i went up into the mount having them in my
hands
and he wrote in the tables according as he had written before
the ten words which the lord spoke to you in the mount from the midst
of the fire when the people were assembled and he gave them to me
and returning from the mount i came down and put the tables into
the ark that i had made and they are there till this present as the
and the children of israel removed their camp from beroth of the
children of jacan into mosera where aaron died and was buried and
following verses seem to be inserted by way of parenthesis
from thence they came to gadgad from which place they departed
and camped in jetebatha in a land of waters and torrents
at that time he separated the tribe of levi to carry the ark of
the covenant of the lord and to stand before him in the ministry and
to bless in his name until this present day
wherefore levi hath no part nor possession with his brethren
because the lord himself is his possession as the lord thy god promised
him
and i stood in the mount as before forty days and nights and
the lord heard me this time also and would not destroy thee
and he said to me go and walk before the people that they may
enter and possess the land which i swore to their fathers that i would
give them
and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but
that thou fear the lord thy god and walk in his ways and love him and
serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul
and keep the commandments of the lord and his ceremonies which
behold heaven is the lords thy god and the heaven of heaven
the earth and all things that are therein
and yet the lord hath been closely joined to thy fathers and
loved them and chose their seed after them that is to say you out of
all nations as this day it is proved
circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and stiffen your
neck no more
because the lord your god he is the god of gods and the lord of
lords a great god and mighty and terrible who accepteth no person nor
taketh bribes
he doth judgment to the fatherless and the widow loveth the
stranger and giveth him food and raiment
and do you therefore love strangers because you also were
strangers in the land of egypt
thou shalt fear the lord thy god and serve him only to him thou
shalt adhere and shalt swear by his name
he is thy praise and thy god that hath done for thee these
great and terrible things which thy eyes have seen
in seventy souls thy fathers went down into egypt and behold now
the lord thy god hath multiplied thee as the stars of heaven
them that serve him and threats of punishment if they forsake his law
therefore love the lord thy god and observe his precepts and
ceremonies his judgments and commandments at all times
know this day the things that your children know not who saw not
the chastisements of the lord your god his great doings and strong
hand and stretched out arm
the signs and works which he did in the midst of egypt to king
and to all the host of the egyptians and to their horses and
chariots how the waters of the red sea covered them when they pursued
you and how the lord destroyed them until this present day
and what he hath done to you in the wilderness til you came to
this place
and to dathan and abiron the sons of eliab who was the son of
households and tents and all their substance which they had in the
midst of israel
your eyes have seen all the great works of the lord that he hath
done
that you may keep all his commandments which i command you this
day and may go in and possess the land to which you are entering
and may live in it a long time which the lord promised by oath to
your fathers and to their seed a land which floweth with milk and
honey
for the land which thou goest to possess is not like the land
of egypt from whence thou camest out where when the seed is sown
waters are brought in to water it after the manner of gardens
but it is a land of hills and plains expecting rain from heaven
and the lord thy god doth always visit it and his eyes are on it
from the beginning of the year unto the end thereof
if then you obey my commandments which i command you this day
that you love the lord your god and serve him with all your heart and
with all your soul
he will give to your land the early rain and the latter rain
that you may gather in your corn and your wine and your oil
and your hay out of the fields to feed your cattle and that you
may eat and be filled
beware lest perhaps your heart be deceived and you depart from
the lord and serve strange gods and adore them
and the lord being angry shut up heaven that the rain come not
down nor the earth yield her fruit and you perish quickly from the
excellent land which the lord will give you
lay up these words in your hearts and minds and hang them for a
sign on your hands and place them between your eyes
teach your children that they meditate on them when thou sittest
in thy house and when thou walkest on the way and when thou liest down
and risest up
thou shalt write them upon the posts and the doors of thy house
that thy days may be multiplied and the days of thy children in
the land which the lord swore to thy fathers that he would give them as
long as the heaven hangeth over the earth
for if you keep the commandments which i command you and do
them to love the lord your god and walk in all his ways cleaving unto
him
the lord will destroy all these nations before your face and you
shall possess them which are greater and stronger than you
every place that your foot shall tread upon shall be yours
the western sea shall be your borders
none shall stand against you the lord your god shall lay the
dread and fear of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon as he
hath spoken to you
behold i set forth in your sight this day a blessing and a curse
a blessing if you obey the commandments of the lord your god
which i command you this day
a curse if you obey not the commandments of the lord your god
but revolt from the way which now i shew you and walk after strange
gods which you know not
and when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land
whither thou goest to dwell thou shalt put the blessing upon mount
which are beyond the jordan behind the way that goeth to the
setting of the sun in the land of the chanaanite who dwelleth in the
plain country over against galgala which is near the valley that
reacheth and entereth far
for you shall pass over the jordan to possess the land which
the lord your god will give you that you may have it and possess it
see therefore that you fulfil the ceremonies and judgments which
must be offered in one only place all eating of blood is prohibited
these are the precepts and judgments that you must do in the
land which the lord the god of thy fathers will give thee to possess
it all the days that thou shalt walk upon the earth
destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall
possess worshipped their gods upon high mountains and hills and under
every shady tree
overthrow their altars and break down their statues burn their
groves with fire and break their idols in pieces destroy their names
out of those places
you shall not do so to the lord your god
but you shall come to the place which the lord your god shall
choose out of all your tribes to put his name there and to dwell in
it
and you shall offer in that place your holocausts and victims the
tithes and firstfruits of your hands and your vows and gifts the
firstborn of your herds and your sheep
and you shall eat there in the sight of the lord your god and you
shall rejoice in all things whereunto you shall put your hand you and
your houses wherein the lord your god hath blessed you
you shall not do there the things we do here this day every man
that which seemeth good to himself
for until this present time you are not come to rest and to the
possession which the lord your god will give you
you shall pass over the jordan and shall dwell in the land which
the lord your god will give you that you may have rest from all enemies
round about and may dwell without any fear
in the place which the lord your god shall choose that his name
may be therein thither shall you bring all the things that i command
you holocausts and victims and tithes and the firstfruits of your
hands and whatsoever is the choicest in the gifts which you shall vow
to the lord
there shall you feast before the lord your god you and your sons
and your daughters your menservants and maidservants and the levite
that dwelleth in your cities for he hath no other part and possession
among you
beware lest thou offer thy holocausts in every place that thou
shalt see
but in the place which the lord shall choose in one of thy tribes
shalt thou offer sacrifices and shalt do all that i command thee
but if thou desirest to eat and the eating of flesh delight
thee kill and eat according to the blessing of the lord thy god which
he hath given thee in thy cities whether it be unclean that is to
say having blemish or defect or clean that is to say sound and
without blemish such as may be offered as the roe and the hart shalt
thou eat it
only the blood thou shalt not eat but thou shalt pour it out
upon the earth as water
thou mayst not eat in thy towns the tithes of thy corn and thy
wine and thy oil the firstborn of thy herds and thy cattle nor any
thing that thou vowest and that thou wilt offer voluntarily and the
firstfruits of thy hands
but thou shalt eat them before the lord thy god in the place
which the lord thy god shall choose thou and thy son and thy daughter
and thy manservant and maidservant and the levite that dwelleth in thy
cities and thou shalt rejoice and be refreshed before the lord thy god
in all things whereunto thou shalt put thy hand
take heed thou forsake not the levite all the time that thou
livest in the land
when the lord thy god shall have enlarged thy borders as he hath
spoken to thee and thou wilt eat the flesh that thy soul desireth
and if the place which the lord thy god shall choose that his
name should be there be far off thou shalt kill of thy herds and of
thy flocks as i have commanded thee and shalt eat in thy towns as it
pleaseth thee
even as the roe and the hart is eaten so shalt thou eat them
both the clean and unclean shall eat of them alike
only beware of this that thou eat not the blood for the blood
is for the soul and therefore thou must not eat the soul with the
flesh
but thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water
that it may be well with thee and thy children after thee when
thou shalt do that which is pleasing in the sight of the lord
but the things which thou hast sanctified and vowed to the lord
thou shalt take and shalt come to the place which the lord shall
choose
and shalt offer thy oblations the flesh and the blood upon the
altar of the lord thy god the blood of thy victims thou shalt pour on
the altar and the flesh thou thyself shalt eat
observe and hear all the things that i command thee that it may
be well with thee and thy children after thee for ever when thou shalt
do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the lord thy god
when the lord thy god shall have destroyed before thy face the
nations which thou shalt go in to possess and when thou shalt possess
them and dwell in their land
beware lest thou imitate them after they are destroyed at thy
coming in and lest thou seek after their ceremonies saying as these
nations have worshipped their gods so will i also worship
thou shalt not do in like manner to the lord thy god for they
have done to their gods all the abominations which the lord abhorreth
offering their sons and daughters and burning them with fire
what i command thee that only do thou to the lord neither add
any thing nor diminish
of the heathens or to make any alterations in the divine ordinances
if there rise in the midst of thee a prophet or one that saith he
hath dreamed a dream and he foretell a sign and a wonder
and that come to pass which he spoke and he say to thee let us
go and follow strange gods which thou knowest not and let us serve
them
thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or dreamer for the
all your heart and with all your soul or not
follow the lord your god and fear him and keep his commandments
and hear his voice him you shall serve and to him you shall cleave
and that prophet or forger of dreams shall be slain because he
spoke to draw you away from the lord your god who brought you out of
the land of egypt and redeemed you from the house of bondage to make
thee go out of the way which the lord thy god commanded thee and thou
shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee
if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or daughter or
thy wife that is in thy bosom or thy friend whom thou lovest as thy
own soul would persuade thee secretly saying let us go and serve
strange gods which thou knowest not nor thy fathers
of all the nations round about that are near or afar off from
one end of the earth to the other
consent not to him hear him not neither let thy eye spare him to
pity and conceal him
but thou shalt presently put him to death let thy hand be first
upon him and afterwards the hands of all the people
but by informing the magistrate and proceeding by order of justice
with stones shall he be stoned to death because he would have
withdrawn thee from the lord thy god who brought thee out of the land
of egypt from the house of bondage
that all israel hearing may fear and may do no more any thing
like this
if in one of thy cities which the lord thy god shall give thee
to dwell in thou hear some say
children of belial are gone out of the midst of thee and have
withdrawn the inhabitants of their city and have said let us go and
serve strange gods which you know not
subject to the divine law are called in scripture the children of
inquire carefully and diligently the truth of the thing by
looking well into it and if thou find that which is said to be certain
and that this abomination hath been really committed
thou shalt forthwith kill the inhabitants of that city with the
edge of the sword and shalt destroy it and all things that are in it
even the cattle
and all the household goods that are there thou shalt gather
together in the midst of the streets thereof and shall burn them with
the city itself so as to comsume all for the lord thy god and that it
be a heap for ever it shall be built no more
and there shall nothing of that anathema stick to thy hand that
the lord may turn from the wrath of his fury and may have mercy on
thee and multiply thee as he swore to thy fathers
when thou shalt hear the voice of the lord thy god keeping all
his precepts which i command thee this day that thou mayst do what is
pleasing in the sight of the lord thy god
concerning tithes and firstfruits
be ye children of the lord your god you shall not cut yourselves
nor make any baldness for the dead
because thou art a holy people to the lord thy god and he chose
thee to be his peculiar people of all nations that are upon the earth
eat not the things that are unclean
these are the beasts that you shall eat the ox and the sheep
and the goat
the hart and the roe the buffle the chamois the pygarg the
wild goat the camelopardalus
every beast that divideth the hoof in two parts and cheweth the
cud you shall eat
but of them that chew the cud but divide not the hoof you shall
not eat such as the camel the hare and the cherogril because they
chew the cud but divide not the hoof they shall be unclean to you
the swine also because it divideth the hoof but cheweth not the
cud shall be unclean their flesh you shall not eat and their
carcasses you shall not touch
these shall you eat of all that abide in the waters all that have
fins and scales you shall eat
such as are without fins and scales you shall not eat because
they are unclean
all birds that are clean you shall eat
the unclean eat not to wit the eagle and the grype and the
osprey
the ringtail and the vulture and the kite according to their
kind
and all of the ravens kind
and the ostrich and the owl and the larus and the hawk
according to its kind
the heron and the swan and the stork
and the cormorant the porphirion and the night crow
the bittern and the charadrion every one in their kind the
houp also and the bat
every thing that creepeth and hath little wings shall be
unclean and shall not be eaten
all that is clean you shall eat
but whatsoever is dead of itself eat not thereof give it to the
stranger that is within thy gates to eat or sell it to him because
thou art the holy people of the lord thy god thou shalt not boil a kid
in the milk of his dam
every year thou shalt set aside the tithes of all thy fruits that
the earth bringeth forth
and thou shalt eat before the lord thy god in the place which he
shall choose that his name may be called upon therein the tithe of thy
corn and thy wine and thy oil and the firstborn of thy herds and thy
sheep that thou mayst learn to fear the lord thy god at all times
but when the way and the place which the lord thy god shall
choose are far off and he hath blessed thee and thou canst not carry
all these things thither
thou shalt sell them all and turn them into money and shalt
carry it in thy hand and shalt go to the place which the lord shall
choose
and thou shalt buy with the same money whatsoever pleaseth thee
either of the herds or of sheep wine also and strong drink and all
that thy soul desireth and thou shalt eat before the lord thy god and
shalt feast thou and thy house
and the levite that is within thy gates beware thou forsake him
not because he hath no other part in thy possession
the third year thou shalt separate another tithe of all things
that grow to thee at that time and shalt lay it up within thy gates
and the levite that hath no other part nor possession with thee
and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow that are within thy
gates shall come and shall eat and be filled that the lord thy god may
bless thee in all the works of thy hands that thou shalt do
to be sanctified to the lord
in the seventh year thou shalt make a remission
which shall be celebrated in this order he to whom any thing is
owing from his friend or neighbour or brother cannot demand it again
because it is the year of remission of the lord
of the foreigner or stranger thou mayst exact it of thy
countryman and neighbour thou shalt not have power to demand it again
and there shall be no poor nor beggar among you that the lord thy
that there should be no poor in israel as appears from ver where
we learn that gods people would never be at a loss to find objects for
their charity but it is an ordinance that all should do their best
endeavours to prevent any of their brethren from suffering the hardships
of poverty and want
yet so if thou hear the voice of the lord thy god and keep all
things that he hath ordained and which i command thee this day he will
bless thee as he hath promised
thou shalt lend to many nations and thou shalt borrow of no man
dominion over thee
if one of thy brethren that dwelleth within thy gates of thy city
in the land which the lord thy god will give thee come to poverty thou
shalt not harden thy heart nor close thy hand
but shalt open it to the poor man thou shalt lend him that which
thou perceivest he hath need of
beware lest perhaps a wicked thought steal in upon thee and thou
say in thy heart the seventh year of remission draweth nigh and thou
turn away thy eyes from thy poor brother denying to lend him that which
he asketh lest he cry against thee to the lord and it become a sin
unto thee
but thou shalt give to him neither shalt thou do any thing
craftily in relieving his necessities that the lord thy god may bless
thee at all times and in all things to which thou shalt put thy hand
there will not be wanting poor in the land of thy habitation
therefore i command thee to open thy hand to thy needy and poor brother
that liveth in the land
when thy brother a hebrew man or hebrew woman is sold to thee
and hath served thee six years in the seventh year thou shalt let him
go free
and when thou sendest him out free thou shalt not let him go
away empty
but shall give him for his way out of thy flocks and out of thy
barnfloor and thy winepress wherewith the lord thy god shall bless
thee
remember that thou also wast a bondservant in the land of egypt
and the lord thy god made thee free and therefore i now command thee
this
but if he say i will not depart because he loveth thee and thy
house and findeth that he is well with thee
thou shalt take an awl and bore through his ear in the door of
thy house and he shall serve thee for ever thou shalt do in like
manner to thy womanservant also
turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them free
because he hath served thee six years according to the wages of a
hireling that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the works that
thou dost
of the firstlings that come of thy herds and thy sheep thou
shalt sanctify to the lord thy god whatsoever is of the male sex thou
shalt not work with the firstling of a bullock and thou shalt not shear
the firstlings of thy sheep
in the sight of the lord thy god shalt thou eat them every year
in the place that the lord shall choose thou and thy house
but if it have a blemish or be lame or blind or in any part
disfigured or feeble it shall not be sacrificed to the lord thy god
but thou shalt eat it within the gates of thy city the clean and
the unclean shall eat them alike as the roe and as the hart
only thou shalt take heed not to eat their blood but pour it out
on the earth as water
appointed in every city all occasions of idolatry to be avoided
observe the month of new corn which is the first of the spring
that thou mayst celebrate the phase to the lord thy god because in this
month the lord thy god brought thee out of egypt by night
and thou shalt sacrifice the phase to the lord thy god of sheep
and of oxen in the place which the lord thy god shall choose that his
name may dwell there
thou shalt not eat with it leavened bread seven days shalt thou
eat without leaven the bread of affliction because thou camest out of
no leaven shall be seen in all thy coasts for seven days neither
shall any of the flesh of that which was sacrificed the first day in the
evening remain until morning
thou mayst not immolate the phase in any one of thy cities which
the lord thy god will give thee
but in the place which the lord thy god shall choose that his
name may dwell there thou shalt immolate the phase in the evening at
the going down of the sun at which time thou camest out of egypt
and thou shalt dress and eat it in the place which the lord thy
dwellings
six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day
because it is the assembly of the lord thy god thou shalt do no work
thou shalt number unto thee seven weeks from that day wherein
thou didst put the sickle to the corn
and thou shalt celebrate the festival of weeks to the lord thy
to the blessing of the lord thy god
and thou shalt feast before the lord thy god thou and thy son
and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the
and the widow who abide with you in the place which the lord thy god
shall choose that his name may dwell there
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in egypt and
thou shalt keep and do the things that are commanded
thou shalt celebrate the solemnity also of tabernacles seven
days when thou hast gathered in thy fruit of the barnfloor and of the
winepress
and thou shalt make merry in thy festival time thou thy son
and thy daughter thy manservant and thy maidservant the levite also
and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow that are within thy
gates
seven days shalt thou celebrate feasts to the lord thy god in the
place which the lord shall choose and the lord thy god will bless thee
in all thy fruits and in every work of thy hands and thou shalt be in
joy
three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord
thy god in the place which he shall choose in the feast of unleavened
bread in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles no one
shall appear with his hands empty before the lord
but every one shall offer according to what he hath according to
the blessing of the lord his god which he shall give him
thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all thy gates which
the lord thy god shall give thee in all thy tribes that they may judge
the people with just judgment
and not go aside to either part thou shalt not accept person nor
gifts for gifts blind the eyes of the wise and change the words of the
just
thou shalt follow justly after that which is just that thou
mayst live and possess the land which the lord thy god shall give thee
thou shalt plant no grove nor any tree near the altar of the
neither shalt thou make nor set up to thyself a statue which
things the lord thy god hateth
sentence must be obeyed under pain of death the duty of a king who is
to receive the law of god at the priests hands
thou shalt not sacrifice to the lord thy god a sheep or an ox
wherein there is blemish or any fault for that is an abomination to
the lord thy god
when there shall be found among you within any of thy gates which
the lord thy god shall give thee man or woman that do evil in the sight
of the lord thy god and transgress his covenant
so as to go and serve strange gods and adore them the sun and
the moon and all the host of heaven which i have not commanded
and this is told thee and hearing it thou hast inquired
diligently and found it to be true and that the abomination is
committed in israel
thou shalt bring forth the man or the woman who have committed
that most wicked thing to the gates of thy city and they shall be
stoned
by the mouth of two or three witnesses shall he die that is to be
slain let no man be put to death when only one beareth witness against
him
the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him
and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people that thou mayst take
away the evil out of the midst of thee
if thou perceive that there be among you a hard and doubtful
matter in judgment between blood and blood cause and cause leprosy and
leprosy and thou see that the words of the judges within thy gates do
vary arise and go up to the place which the lord thy god shall
choose
give to the church guides of the old testament in deciding without
appeal all controversies relating to the law promising that they
should not err therein and surely he has not done less for the church
guides of the new testament
and thou shalt come to the priests of the levitical race and to
the judge that shall be at that time and thou shalt ask of them and
they shall shew thee the truth of the judgment
and thou shalt do whatsoever they shall say that preside in the
place which the lord shall choose and what they shall teach thee
according to his law and thou shalt follow their sentence
neither shalt thou decline to the right hand nor to the left hand
but he that will be proud and refuse to obey the commandment of
the priest who ministereth at that time to the lord thy god and the
decree of the judge that man shall die and thou shalt take away the
evil from israel
and all the people hearing it shall fear that no one afterwards
swell with pride
when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god will
give thee and possessest it and shalt say i will set a king over me
as all nations have that are round about
thou shalt set him whom the lord thy god shall choose out of the
number of thy brethren thou mayst not make a man of another nation
king that is not thy brother
and when he is made king he shall not multiply horses to
himself nor lead back the people into egypt being lifted up with the
number of his horsemen especially since the lord hath commanded you to
return no more the same way
he shall not have many wives that may allure his mind nor
immense sums of silver and gold
but after he is raised to the throne of his kingdom he shall
copy out to himself the deuteronomy of this law in a volume taking the
copy of the priests of the levitical tribe
and he shall have it with him and shall read it all the days of
his life that he may learn to fear the lord his god and keep his words
and ceremonies that are commanded in the law
and that his heart be not lifted up with pride over his brethren
nor decline to the right or to the left that he and his sons may reign
a long time over israel
abominations are to be avoided the great prophet christ is promised
the priests and levites and all that are of the same tribe shall
have no part nor inheritance with the rest of israel because they shall
eat the sacrifices of the lord and his oblations
and they shall receive nothing else of the possession of their
brethren for the lord himself is their inheritance as he hath said to
them
this shall be the priests due from the people and from them that
offer victims whether they sacrifice an ox or a sheep they shall give
to the priest the shoulder and the breast
the firstfruits also of corn of wine and of oil and a part of
the wool from the shearing of their sheep
for the lord thy god hath chosen him of all thy tribes to stand
and to minister to the name of the lord him and his sons for ever
if a levite go out of any one of the cities throughout all israel
in which he dwelleth and have a longing mind to come to the place which
the lord shall choose
he shall minister in the name of the lord his god as all his
brethren the levites do that shall stand at that time before the lord
he shall receive the same portion of food that the rest do
besides that which is due to him in his own city by succession from his
fathers
when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god shall give
thee beware lest thou have a mind to imitate the abominations of those
nations
neither let there be found among you any one that shall expiate
his son or daughter making them to pass through the fire or that
consulteth soothsayers or observeth dreams and omens neither let there
be any wizard
nor charmer nor any one that consulteth pythonic spirits or
fortune tellers or that seeketh the truth from the dead
for the lord abhorreth all these things and for these
abominations he will destroy them at thy coming
thou shalt be perfect and without spot before the lord thy god
these nations whose land thou shalt possess hearken to
soothsayers and diviners but thou art otherwise instructed by the lord
thy god
the lord thy god will raise up to thee a prophet of thy nation
and of thy brethren like unto me him thou shalt hear
as thou desiredst of the lord thy god in horeb when the assembly
was gathered together and saidst let me not hear any more the voice of
the lord my god neither let me see any more this exceeding great fire
lest i die
and the lord said to me they have spoken all things well
i will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of their brethren
like to thee and i will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak
to them all that i shall command him
and he that will not hear his words which he shall speak in my
name i will be the revenger
but the prophet who being corrupted with pride shall speak in
my name things that i did not command him to say or in the name of
strange gods shall be slain
and if in silent thought thou answer how shall i know the word
that the lord hath not spoken
thou shalt have this sign whatsoever that same prophet
foretelleth in the name of the lord and it cometh not to pass that
thing the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath forged it by the
pride of his mind and therefore thou shalt not fear him
punished
when the lord thy god hath destroyed the nations whose land he
will deliver to thee and thou shalt possess it and shalt dwell in the
cities and houses thereof
thou shalt separate to thee three cities in the midst of the land
which the lord will give thee in possession
paving diligently the way and thou shalt divide the whole
province of thy land equally into three parts that he who is forced to
flee for manslaughter may have near at hand whither to escape
this shall be the law of the slayer that fleeth whose life is to
be saved he that killeth his neighbor ignorantly and who is proved to
have had no hatred against him yesterday and the day before
but to have gone with him to the wood to hew wood and in cutting
down the tree the axe slipped out of his hand and the iron slipping
from the handle struck his friend and killed him he shall flee to one
of the cities aforesaid and live
lest perhaps the next kinsman of him whose blood was shed pushed
on by his grief should pursue and apprehend him if the way be too
long and take away the life of him who is not guilty of death because
he is proved to have had no hatred before against him that was slain
therefore i command thee that thou separate three cities at equal
distance one from another
and when the lord thy god shall have enlarged thy borders as he
swore to the fathers and shall give thee all the land that he promised
them
yet so if thou keep his commandments and do the things which i
command thee this day that thou love the lord thy god and walk in his
ways at all times thou shalt add to thee other three cities and shalt
double the number of the three cities aforesaid
that innocent blood may not be shed in the midst of the land
which the lord thy god will give thee to possess lest thou be guilty of
blood
but if any man hating his neighbour lie in wait for his life
and rise and strike him and he die and he flee to one of the cities
aforesaid
the ancients of his city shall send and take him out of the
place of refuge and shall deliver him into the hand of the kinsman of
him whose blood was shed and he shall die
thou shalt not pity him and thou shalt take away the guilt of
innocent blood out of israel that it may be well with thee
thou shalt not take nor remove thy neighbours landmark which
thy predecessors have set in thy possession which the lord thy god will
give thee in the land that thou shalt receive to possess
one witness shall not rise up against any man whatsoever the sin
or wickedness be but in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
shall stand
if a lying witness stand against a man accusing him of
transgression
both of them between whom the controversy is shall stand before
the lord in the sight of the priests and the judges that shall be in
those days
and when after most diligent inquisition they shall find that
the false witness hath told a lie against his brother
they shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother and
thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee
that others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things
thou shalt not pity him but shalt require life for life eye for
eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
if thou go out to war against thy enemies and see horsemen and
chariots and the numbers of the enemys army greater than thine thou
shalt not fear them because the lord thy god is with thee who brought
thee out of the land of egypt
and when the battle is now at hand the priest shall stand before
the army and shall speak to the people in this manner
hear o israel you join battle this day against your enemies let
not your heart be dismayed be not afraid do not give back fear ye
them not
because the lord your god is in the midst of you and will fight
for you against your enemies to deliver you from danger
and the captains shall proclaim through every band in the hearing
of the army what man is there that hath built a new house and hath
not dedicated it let him go and return to his house lest he die in the
battle and another man dedicate it
what man is there that hath planted a vineyard and hath not as
yet made it to be common whereof all men may eat let him go and
return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man execute
his office
what man is there that hath espoused a wife and not taken her
let him go and return to his house lest he die in the war and another
man take her
after these things are declared they shall add the rest and shall
speak to the people what man is there that is fearful and faint
hearted let him go and return to his house lest he make the hearts of
his brethren to fear as he himself is possessed with fear
and when the captains of the army shall hold their peace and have
made an end of speaking every man shall prepare their bands to fight
if at any time thou come to fight against a city thou shalt
first offer it peace
if they receive it and open the gates to thee all the people
that are therein shall be saved and shall serve thee paying tribute
but if they will not make peace and shall begin war against
thee thou shalt besiege it
and when the lord thy god shall deliver it into thy hands thou
shalt slay all that are therein of the male sex with the edge of the
sword
excepting women and children cattle and other things that are
in the city and thou shalt divide all the prey to the army and thou
shalt eat the spoils of thy enemies which the lord thy god shall give
thee
so shalt thou do to all cities that are at a great distance from
thee and are not of these cities which thou shalt receive in
possession
but of those cities that shall be given thee thou shalt suffer
none at all to live
but shalt kill them with the edge of the sword to wit the
lest they teach you to do all the abominations which they have
done to their gods and you should sin against the lord your god
when thou hast besieged a city a long time and hath compassed it
with bulwarks to take it thou shalt not cut down the trees that may be
eaten of neither shalt thou spoil the country round about with axes
for it is a tree and not a man neither can it increase the number of
them that fight against thee
but if there be any trees that are not fruitful but wild and
fit for other uses cut them down and make engines until thou take the
city which fighteth against thee
must not be deprived of his birthright for hatred of his mother a
stubborn son is to be stoned to death when one is hanged on a gibbet
he must be taken down the same day and buried
when there shall be found in the land which the lord thy god will
give thee the corpse of a man slain and it is not known who is guilty
of the murder
thy ancients and judges shall go out and shall measure from the
place where the body lieth the distance of every city round about
and the ancients of that city which they shall perceive to be
nearer than the rest shall take a heifer of the herd that hath not
drawn in the yoke nor ploughed the ground
and they shall bring her into a rough and stony valley that never
was ploughed nor sown and there they shall strike off the head of the
heifer
and the priests the sons of levi shall come whom the lord thy god
hath chosen to minister to him and to bless in his name and that by
their word every matter should be decided and whatsoever is clean or
unclean should be judged
and the ancients of that city shall come to the person slain and
shall wash their hands over the heifer that was killed in the valley
and shall say our hands did not shed this blood nor did our eyes
see it
be merciful to thy people israel whom thou hast redeemed o lord
and lay not innocent blood to their charge in the midst of thy people
and thou shalt be free from the innocents blood that was shed
when thou shalt have done what the lord hath commanded thee
if thou go out to fight against thy enemies and the lord thy god
deliver them into thy hand and thou lead them away captives
and seest in the number of the captives a beautiful woman and
lovest her and wilt have her to wife
thou shalt bring her into thy house and she shall shave her
hair and pare her nails
and shall put off the raiment wherein she was taken and shall
remain in thy house and mourn for her father and mother one month and
after that thou shalt go in unto her and shalt sleep with her and she
shall be thy wife
but if afterwards she please thee not thou shalt let her go
free but thou mayst not sell her for money nor oppress her by might
because thou hast humbled her
if a man have two wives one beloved and the other hated and
they have had children by him and the son of the hated be the
firstborn
and he meaneth to divide his substance among his sons he may not
make the son of the beloved the firstborn and prefer him before the son
of the hated
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn
and shall give him a double portion of all he hath for this is the
first of his children and to him are due the first birthrights
if a man have a stubborn and unruly son who will not hear the
commandments of his father or mother and being corrected slighteth
obedience
they shall take him and bring him to the ancients of the city
and to the gate of judgment
and shall say to them this our son is rebellious and stubborn
he slighteth hearing our admonitions he giveth himself to revelling
and to debauchery and banquetings
the people of the city shall stone him and he shall die that
you may take away the evil out of the midst of you and all israel
hearing it may be afraid
when a man hath committed a crime for which he is to be punished
with death and being condemned to die is hanged on a gibbet
his body shall not remain upon the tree but shall be buried the
same day for he is accursed of god that hangeth on a tree and thou
shalt not defile thy land which the lord thy god shall give thee in
possession

bring them to thy house and they shall be with thee until thy brother
seek them and receive them

way thou shalt not slight it but shalt lift it up with him

man use womans apparel for he that doth these things is abominable
before god
if thou find as thou walkest by the way a birds nest in a tree
or on the ground and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs
thou shalt not take her with her young
mercy even to irrational creatures and by that means to train them up
to a horror of cruelty and to the exercise of humanity and mutual
charity one to another
but shalt let her go keeping the young which thou hast caught
that it may be well with thee and thou mayst live a long time
when thou buildest a new house thou shalt make a battlement to
the roof round about lest blood be shed in thy house and thou be
guilty if any one slip and fall down headlong

them

seed which thou hast sown and the fruit of the vineyard be sanctified
together

thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of woollen and linen
together
thou shalt make strings in the hem at the four corners of thy
cloak wherewith thou shalt be covered

and seek occasions to put her away laying to her charge a very
ill name and say i took this woman to wife and going in to her i
found her not a virgin
her father and mother shall take her and shall bring with them
the tokens of her virginity to the ancients of the city that are in the
gate
and the father shall say i gave my daughter unto this man to
wife and because he hateth her
he layeth to her charge a very ill name so as to say i found
not thy daughter a virgin and behold these are the tokens of my
daughters virginity and they shall spread the cloth before the
ancients of the city
and the ancients of that city shall take that man and beat him
condemning him besides in a hundred sicles of silver which he
shall give to the damsels father because he hath defamed by a very ill
name a virgin of israel and he shall have her to wife and may not put
her away all the days of his life
but if what he charged her with be true and virginity be not
found in the damsel
they shall cast her out of the doors of her fathers house and

shall be stoned the damsel because she cried not out being in the
city the man because he hath humbled his neighbours wife and thou
shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee
but if a man find a damsel that is betrothed in the field and
taking hold of her lie with her he alone shall die
the damsel shall suffer nothing neither is she guilty of death
for as a robber riseth against his brother and taketh away his life so
also did the damsel suffer
she was alone in the field she cried and there was no man to
help her
if a man find a damsel that is a virgin who is not espoused and

in the church of god who is not to be denied his maintenance cor

when brethren dwell together and one of them dieth without
children the wife of the deceased shall not marry to another but his
brother shall take her and raise up seed for his brother
and the first son he shall have of her he shall call by his name
that his name be not abolished out of israel
but if he will not take his brothers wife who by law belongeth
to him the woman shall go to the gate of the city and call upon the
ancients and say my husbands brother refuseth to raise up his
brothers name in israel and will not take me to wife
and they shall cause him to be sent for forthwith and shall ask
him if he answer i will not take her to wife
the woman shall come to him before the ancients and shall take
off his shoe from his foot and spit in his face and say so shall it
be done to the man that will not build up his brothers house
and his name shall be called in israel the house of the unshod
if two men have words together and one begin to fight against
the other and the others wife willing to deliver her husband out of
the hand of the stronger shall put forth her hand and take him by the
secrets
thou shalt cut off her hand neither shalt thou be moved with any
pity in her regard
thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag a greater and a
less
neither shall there be in thy house a greater bushel and a less
thou shalt have a just and a true weight and thy bushel shall be
equal and true that thou mayest live a long time upon the land which
the lord thy god shall give thee
for the lord thy god abhorreth him that doth these things and he
hateth all injustice
remember what amalec did to thee in the way when thou camest out
of egypt
sense sheweth how hateful they are to god and what punishments they
are to look for from his justice who attack and discourage his servants
when they are but just come out as it were of the egypt of this wicked
world and being yet weak and fainthearted are but beginning their
journey to the land of promise
how he met thee and slew the hindmost of the army who sat down
being weary when thou wast spent with hunger and labour and he feared
not god
therefore when the lord thy god shall give thee rest and shall
have subdued all the nations round about in the land which he hath
promised thee thou shalt blot out his name from under heaven see thou
forget it not
offered gods covenant
and when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god will
give thee to possess and hast conquered it and dwellest in it
thou shalt take the first of all thy fruits and put them in a
basket and shalt go to the place which the lord thy god shall choose
that his name may be invocated there
and thou shalt go to the priest that shall be in those days and
say to him i profess this day before the lord thy god that i am come
into the land for which he swore to our fathers that he would give it
us
and the priest taking the basket at thy hand shall set it before
the altar of the lord thy god
and thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the lord thy god the
in a very small number and grew into a nation great and strong and of
an infinite multitude
and the egyptians afflicted us and persecuted us laying on us
most grievous burdens
and we cried to the lord god of our fathers who heard us and
looked down upon our affliction and labour and distress
and brought us out of egypt with a strong hand and a stretched
out arm with great terror with signs and wonders
and brought us into this place and gave us this land flowing with
milk and honey
and therefore now i offer the firstfruits of the land which the
thy god adoring the lord thy god
and thou shalt feast in all the good things which the lord thy
stranger that is with thee
when thou hast made an end of tithing all thy fruits in the
third year of tithes thou shalt give it to the levite and to the
stranger and to the fatherless and to the widow that they may eat
within thy gates and be filled
and thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the lord thy god i
have taken that which was sanctified out of my house and i have given
it to the levite and to the stranger and to the fatherless and to the
widow as thou hast commanded me i have not transgressed thy
commandments nor forgotten thy precepts
i have not eaten of them in my mourning nor separated them for
any uncleanness nor spent any thing of them in funerals i have obeyed
the voice of the lord my god and have done all things as thou hast
commanded me
look from thy sanctuary and thy high habitation of heaven and
bless thy people israel and the land which thou hast given us as thou
didst swear to our fathers a land flowing with milk and honey
this day the lord thy god hath commanded thee to do these
commandments and judgments and to keep and fulfil them with all thy
heart and with all thy soul
thou hast chosen the lord this day to be thy god and to walk in
his ways and keep his ceremonies and precepts and judgments and obey
his command
and the lord hath chosen thee this day to be his peculiar
people as he hath spoken to thee and to keep all his commandments
and to make thee higher than all nations which he hath created
to his own praise and name and glory that thou mayst be a holy people
of the lord thy god as he hath spoken
sacrifices offered the observers of the commandments are to be blessed
and the transgressors cursed
and moses with the ancients of israel commanded the people
saying keep every commandment that i command you this day
and when you are passed over the jordan into the land which the
plaster them over with plaster
that thou mayst write on them all the words of this law when thou
art passed over the jordan that thou mayst enter into the land which
the lord thy god will give thee a land flowing with milk and honey as
he swore to thy fathers
therefore when you are passed over the jordan set up the stones
which i command you this day in mount hebal and thou shalt plaster
them with plaster
and thou shalt build there an altar to the lord thy god of stones
which iron hath not touched
and of stones not fashioned nor polished and thou shalt offer
upon it holocausts to the lord thy god
and shalt immolate peace victims and eat there and feast before
the lord thy god
and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
plainly and clearly
and moses and the priests of the race of levi said to all israel
thou shalt hear his voice and do the commandments and justices
which i command thee
and moses commanded the people in that day saying
these shall stand upon mount garizim to bless the people when
you are passed the jordan simeon levi juda issachar joseph and
and over against them shall stand on mount hebal to curse ruben
and the levites shall pronounce and say to all the men of israel
with a loud voice
cursed be the man that maketh a graven and molten thing the
abomination of the lord the work of the hands of artificers and shall
put it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say amen
cursed be he that honoureth not his father and mother and all
the people shall say amen
cursed be he that removeth his neighbours landmarks and all the
people shall say amen
cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of his way and
all the people shall say amen
cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger of the
fatherless and the widow and all the people shall say amen
cursed be he that lieth with his fathers wife and uncovereth
his bed and all the people shall say amen
cursed be he that lieth with any beast and all the people shall
say amen
cursed be he that lieth with his sister the daughter of his
father or of his mother and all the people shall say amen
cursed be he that lieth with his motherinlaw and all the
people shall say amen
cursed be he that secretly killeth his neighbour and all the
people shall say amen
cursed be he that taketh gifts to slay an innocent person and
all the people shall say amen
cursed be he that abideth not in the words of this law and
fulfilleth them not in work and all the people shall say amen
curses threatened to transgressors
now if thou wilt hear the voice of all his commandments which i
command thee this day the lord thy god will make thee higher than all
the nations that are on the earth
and all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee
yet so if thou hear his precepts
blessings to the keepers of his law heaven not being opened as yet and
that gross and sensual people being more moved with present and sensible
things but in the new testament the goods that are promised us are
spiritual and eternal and temporal evils are turned into blessings
blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed in the field
blessed shall be the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy
ground and the fruit of thy cattle the droves of thy herds and the
folds of thy sheep
blessed shall be thy barns and blessed thy stores
blessed shalt thou be coming in and going out
the lord shall cause thy enemies that rise up against thee to
fall down before thy face one way shall they come out against thee and
seven ways shall they flee before thee
the lord will send forth a blessing upon thy storehouses and upon
all the works of thy hands and will bless thee in the land that thou
shalt receive
the lord will raise thee up to be a holy people to himself as he
swore to thee if thou keep the commandments of the lord thy god and
walk in his ways
and all the people of the earth shall see that the name of the
the lord will make thee abound with all goods with the fruit of
thy womb and the fruit of thy cattle with the fruit of thy land which
the lord swore to thy fathers that he would give thee
the lord will open his excellent treasure the heaven that it
may give rain in due season and he will bless all the works of thy
hands and thou shalt lend to many nations and shalt not borrow of any
one
and the lord shall make thee the head and not the tail and thou
shalt be always above and not beneath yet so if thou wilt hear the
commandments of the lord thy god which i command thee this day and keep
and do them
and turn not away from them neither to the right hand nor to the
left nor follow strange gods nor worship them
but if thou wilt not hear the voice of the lord thy god to keep
and to do all his commandments and ceremonies which i command thee this
day all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee
law in the old testament but now he often suffers sinners to prosper in
this world rewarding them for some little good they have done and
reserving their punishment for the other world
cursed shalt thou be in the city cursed in the field
cursed shall be thy barn and cursed thy stores
cursed shall be the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy
ground the herds of thy oxen and the flocks of thy sheep
cursed shalt thou be coming in and cursed going out
the lord shall send upon thee famine and hunger and a rebuke
upon all the works which thou shalt do until he consume and destroy
thee quickly for thy most wicked inventions by which thou hast
forsaken me
may the lord set the pestilence upon thee until he consume thee
out of the land which thou shalt go in to possess
may the lord afflict thee with miserable want with the fever and
with cold with burning and with heat and with corrupted air and with
blasting and pursue thee till thou perish
be the heaven that is over thee of brass and the ground thou
treadest on of iron
the lord give thee dust for rain upon thy land and let ashes
come down from heaven upon thee till thou be consumed
the lord make thee to fall down before thy enemies one way mayst
thou go out against them and flee seven ways and be scattered
throughout all the kingdoms of the earth
and be thy carcass meat for all the fowls of the air and the
beasts of the earth and be there none to drive them away
the lord strike thee with the ulcer of egypt and the part of thy
body by which the dung is cast out with the scab and with the itch so
that thou canst not be healed
the lord strike thee with madness and blindness and fury of mind
and mayst thou grope at midday as the blind is wont to grope in
the dark and not make straight thy ways and mayst thou at all times
suffer wrong and be oppressed with violence and mayst thou have no one
to deliver thee
mayst thou take a wife and another sleep with her mayst thou
build a house and not dwell therein mayest thou plant a vineyard and
not gather the vintage thereof
may thy ox be slain before thee and thou not eat thereof may
thy ass be taken away in thy sight and not restored to thee may thy
sheep be given to thy enemies and may there be none to help thee
may thy sons and thy daughters be given to another people thy
eyes looking on and languishing at the sight of them all the day and
may there be no strength in thy hand
may a people which thou knowest not eat the fruits of thy land
and all thy labours and mayst thou always suffer oppression and be
crushed at all times
and be astonished at the terror of those things which thy eyes
shall see
may the lord strike thee with a very sore ulcer in the knees and
in the legs and be thou incurable from the sole of the foot to the top
of the head
the lord shall bring thee and thy king whom thou shalt have
appointed over thee into a nation which thou and thy fathers know not
and there thou shalt serve strange gods wood and stone
and thou shalt be lost as a proverb and a byword to all people
among whom the lord shall bring thee in
thou shalt cast much seed into the ground and gather little
because the locusts shall consume all
thou shalt plant a vineyard and dig it and shalt not drink the
wine nor gather any thing thereof because it shall be wasted with
worms
thou shalt have olive trees in all thy borders and shalt not be
anointed with the oil for the olives shall fall off and perish
thou shalt beget sons and daughters and shalt not enjoy them
because they shall be led into captivity
the blast shall consume all the trees and the fruits of thy
ground
the stranger that liveth with thee in the land shall rise up
over thee and shall be higher and thou shalt go down and be lower
he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall
be as the head and thou shalt be the tail
and all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue and
overtake thee till thou perish because thou heardst not the voice of
the lord thy god and didst not keep his commandments and ceremonies
which he commanded thee
and they shall be as signs and wonders on thee and on thy seed
for ever
because thou didst not serve the lord thy god with joy and
gladness of heart for the abundance of all things
thou shalt serve thy enemy whom the lord will send upon thee in
hunger and thirst and nakedness and in want of all things and he
shall put an iron yoke upon thy neck till he consume thee
the lord will bring upon thee a nation from afar and from the
uttermost ends of the earth like an eagle that flyeth swiftly whose
tongue thou canst not understand
a most insolent nation that will shew no regard to the ancients
nor have pity on the infant
and will devour the fruit of thy cattle and the fruits of thy
land until thou be destroyed and will leave thee no wheat nor wine
nor oil nor herds of oxen nor flocks of sheep until he destroy thee
and consume thee in all thy cities and thy strong and high wall
be brought down wherein thou trustedst in all thy land thou shalt be
besieged within thy gates in all thy land which the lord thy god will
give thee
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thy womb and the flesh of thy
sons and of thy daughters which the lord thy god shall give thee in
the distress and extremity wherewith thy enemy shall oppress thee
the man that is nice among you and very delicate shall envy his
own brother and his wife that lieth in his bosom
so that he will not give them of the flesh of his children which
he shall eat because he hath nothing else in the siege and the want
wherewith thy enemies shall distress thee within all thy gates
the tender and delicate woman that could not go upon the ground
nor set down her foot for over much niceness and tenderness will envy
her husband who lieth in her bosom the flesh of her son and of her
daughter
and the filth of the afterbirths that come forth from between
her thighs and the children that are born the same hour for they shall
eat them secretly for the want of all things in the siege and distress
wherewith thy enemy shall oppress thee within thy gates
if thou wilt not keep and fulfil all the words of this law that
are written in this volume and fear his glorious and terrible name
that is the lord thy god
the lord shall increase thy plagues and the plagues of thy seed
plagues great and lasting infirmities grievous and perpetual
and he shall bring back on thee all the afflictions of egypt
which thou wast afraid of and they shall stick fast to thee
moreover the lord will bring upon thee all the diseases and
plagues that are not written in the volume of this law till he consume
thee
and you shall remain few in number who before were as the stars
of heaven for multitude because thou heardst not the voice of the lord
thy god
and as the lord rejoiced upon you before doing good to you and
multiplying you so he shall rejoice destroying and bringing you to
nought so that you shall be taken away from the land which thou shalt
go in to possess
the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the farthest
parts of the earth to the ends thereof and there thou shalt serve
strange gods which both thou art ignorant of and thy fathers wood and
stone
neither shalt thou be quiet even in those nations nor shall
there be any rest for the sole of thy foot for the lord will give thee
a fearful heart and languishing eyes and a soul consumed with
pensiveness
and thy life shall be as it were hanging before thee thou shalt
fear night and day neither shalt thou trust thy life
in the morning thou shalt say who will grant me evening and at
evening who will grant me morning for the fearfulness of thy heart
wherewith thou shalt be terrified and for those things which thou shalt
see with thy eyes
the lord shall bring thee again with ships into egypt by the way
whereof he said to thee that thou shouldst see it no more there shalt
thou be set to sale to thy enemies for bondmen and bondwomen and no man
shall buy you
against those that shall break it
these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded moses
to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside that
covenant which he made with them in horeb
and moses called all israel and said to them you have seen all
the things that the lord did before you in the land of egypt to pharao
and to all his servants and to his whole land
the great temptations which thy eyes have seen those mighty
signs and wonders
and the lord hath not given you a heart to understand and eyes to
see and ears that may hear unto this present day
resisted his grace
he hath brought you forty years through the desert your garments
are not worn out neither are the shoes of your feet consumed with age
you have not eaten bread nor have you drunk wine or strong drink
that you might know that i am the lord your god
and you came to this place and sehon king of hesebon and og king
of basan came out against us to fight and we slew them
and took their land and delivered it for a possession to ruben
and gad and the half tribe of manasses
keep therefore the words of this covenant and fulfil them that
you may understand all that you do
you all stand this day before the lord your god your princes
and tribes and ancients and doctors all the people of israel
your children and your wives and the stranger that abideth with
thee in the camp besides the hewers of wood and them that bring water
that thou mayst pass in the covenant of the lord thy god and in
the oath which this day the lord thy god maketh with thee
that he may raise thee up a people to himself and he may be thy
neither with you only do i make this covenant and confirm these
oaths
but with all that are present and that are absent
for you know how we dwelt in the land of egypt and how we have
passed through the midst of nations and passing through them
you have seen their abominations and filth that is to say their
idols wood and stone silver and gold which they worshipped
lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman a family
or a tribe whose heart is turned away this day from the lord our god
to go and serve the gods of those nations and there should be among you
a root bringing forth gall and bitterness
and when he shall hear the words of this oath he should bless
himself in his heart saying i shall have peace and will walk on in the
naughtiness of my heart and the drunken may consume the thirsty
expression which may either be understood as spoken by the sinner
blessing that is flattering himself in his sins with the imagination
of peace and so great an abundance as may satisfy and as it were
consume all thirst and want or it may be referred to the root of
bitterness spoken of before which being drunken with sin may attract
and by that means consume such as thirst after the like evils
and the lord should not forgive him but his wrath and jealousy
against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that time and all
the curses that are written in this volume should light upon him and
the lord should blot out his name from under heaven
and utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of israel
according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law and
covenant
and the following generation shall say and the children that
shall be born hereafter and the strangers that shall come from afar
seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith the lord hath
afflicted it
burning it with brimstone and the heat of salt so that it
cannot be sown any more nor any green thing grow therein after the
example of the destruction of sodom and gomorrha adama and seboim
which the lord destroyed in his wrath and indignation
and all the nations shall say why hath the lord done thus to
this land what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his wrath
and they shall answer because they forsook the covenant of the
land of egypt
and they have served strange gods and adored them whom they
knew not and for whom they had not been assigned
therefore the wrath of the lord was kindled against this land to
bring upon it all the curses that are written in this volume
and he hath cast them out of their land in anger and in wrath
and in very great indignation and hath thrown them into a strange land
as it is seen this day
secret things to the lord our god things that are manifest to
us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of this
law
are known to god alone our business must be to observe what he has
revealed and manifested to us and to direct our lives accordingly
feasible life and death are set before them
now when all these things shall be come upon thee the blessing or
the curse which i have set forth before thee and thou shalt be touched
with repentance of thy heart among all the nations into which the lord
thy god shall have scattered thee
and shalt return to him and obey his commandments as i command
thee this day thou and thy children with all thy heart and with all
thy soul
the lord thy god will bring back again thy captivity and will
have mercy on thee and gather thee again out of all the nations into
which he scattered thee before
if thou be driven as far as the poles of heaven the lord thy god
will fetch thee back from hence
and will take thee to himself and bring thee into the land which
thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and blessing thee he
will make thee more numerous than were thy fathers
the lord thy god will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy
seed that thou mayst love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with
all thy soul that thou mayst live
and he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies and upon them
that hate and persecute thee
but thou shalt return and hear the voice of the lord thy god and
shalt do all the commandments which i command thee this day
and the lord thy god will make thee abound in all the works of thy
hands in the fruit of thy womb and in the fruit of thy cattle in the
fruitfulness of thy land and in the plenty of all things for the lord
will return to rejoice over thee in all good things as he rejoiced in
thy fathers
yet so if thou hear the voice of the lord thy god and keep his
precepts and ceremonies which are written in this law and return to
the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul
this commandment that i command thee this day is not above thee
nor far off from thee
nor is it in heaven that thou shouldst say which of us can go
up to heaven to bring it unto us and we may hear and fulfil it in work
nor is it beyond the sea that thou mayst excuse thyself and
say which of us can cross the sea and bring it unto us that we may
hear and do that which is commanded
but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy
heart that thou mayst do it
consider that i have set before thee this day life and good and
on the other hand death and evil
that thou mayst love the lord thy god and walk in his ways and
keep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments and bless thee in
the land which thou shalt go in to possess
but if thy heart be turned away so that thou wilt not hear and
being deceived with error thou adore strange gods and serve them
i foretell thee this day that thou shalt perish and shalt remain
but a short time in the land to which thou shalt pass over the jordan
and shalt go in to possess it
i call heaven and earth to witness this day that i have set
before you life and death blessing and cursing choose therefore life
that both thou and thy seed may live
and that thou mayst love the lord thy god and obey his voice
and adhere to him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that
thou mayst dwell in the land for which the lord swore to thy fathers
him he delivereth the law to the priests god foretelleth that the
people will often forsake him and that he will punish them he
commandeth moses to write a canticle as a constant remembrancer of the
law
and moses went and spoke all these words to all israel
and he said to them i am this day a hundred and twenty years old
said to me thou shalt not pass over this jordan
the lord thy god then will pass over before thee he will destroy
all these nations in thy sight and thou shalt possess them and this
and the lord shall do to them as he did to sehon and og the kings
of the amorrhites and to their land and shall destroy them
therefore when the lord shall have delivered these also to you
you shall do in like manner to them as i have commanded you
do manfully and be of good heart fear not nor be ye dismayed at
their sight for the lord thy god he himself is thy leader and will not
leave thee nor forsake thee
and moses called josue and said to him before all israel take
courage and be valiant for thou shalt bring this people into the land
which the lord swore he would give to their fathers and thou shalt
divide it by lot
and the lord who is your leader he himself will be with thee he
will not leave thee nor forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed
and moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests the sons
of levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the lord and to all the
ancients of israel
and he commanded them saying after seven years in the year of
remission in the feast of tabernacles
when all israel come together to appear in the sight of the lord
thy god in the place which the lord shall choose thou shalt read the
words of this law before all israel in their hearing
and the people being all assembled together both men and women
children and strangers that are within thy gates that hearing they may
learn and fear the lord your god and keep and fulfil all the words of
this law
that their children also who now are ignorant may hear and
fear the lord their god all the days that they live in the land whither
you are going over the jordan to possess it
and the lord said to moses behold the days of thy death are
nigh call josue and stand ye in the tabernacle of the testimony that
tabernacle of the testimony
and the lord appeared there in the pillar of a cloud which stood
in the entry of the tabernacle
and the lord said to moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers and this people rising up will go a fornicating after strange
gods in the land to which it goeth in to dwell there will they forsake
me and will make void the covenant which i have made with them
and my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day and i
will forsake them and will hide my face from them and they shall be
devoured all evils and afflictions shall find them so that they shall
say in that day in truth it is because god is not with me that these
evils have found me
but i will hide and cover my face in that day for all the evils
which they have done because they have followed strange gods
now therefore write you this canticle and teach the children of
song may be unto me for a testimony among the children of israel
for i will bring them into the land for which i swore to their
fathers that floweth with milk and honey and when they have eaten and
are full and fat they will turn away after strange gods and will serve
them and will despise me and make void my covenant
and after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon them
this canticle shall answer them for a testimony which no oblivion shall
take away out of the mouth of their seed for i know their thoughts and
what they are about to do this day before that i bring them into the
land which i have promised them
moses therefore wrote the canticle and taught it to the children
of israel
and the lord commanded josue the son of nun and said take
courage and be valiant for thou shalt bring the children of israel
into the land which i have promised and i will be with thee
therefore after moses had wrote the words of this law in a
volume and finished it
he commanded the levites who carried the ark of the covenant of
the lord saying
take this book and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant
of the lord your god that it may be there for a testimony against thee
for i know thy obstinacy and thy most stiff neck while i am yet
living and going in with you you have always been rebellious against
the lord how much more when i shall be dead
gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes and your doctors
and i will speak these words in their hearing and will call heaven and
earth to witness against them
for i know that after my death you will do wickedly and will
quickly turn aside form the way that i have commanded you and evils
shall come upon you in the latter times when you shall do evil in the
sight of the lord to provoke him by the works of your hands
moses therefore spoke in the hearing of the whole assembly of
into a mountain from whence he shall see the promised land but not
enter into it
hear o ye heavens the things i speak let the earth give ear to
the words of my mouth
let my doctrine gather as the rain let my speech distil as the
dew as a shower upon the herb and as drops upon the grass
because i will invoke the name of the lord give ye magnificence
to our god
the works of god are perfect and all his ways are judgments god
is faithful and without any iniquity he is just and right
they have sinned against him and are none of his children in
their filth they are a wicked and perverse generation
is this the return thou makest to the lord o foolish and
senseless people is not he thy father that hath possessed thee and
made thee and created thee
remember the days of old think upon every generation ask thy
father and he will declare to thee thy elders and they will tell thee
when the most high divided the nations when he separated the sons
of adam he appointed the bounds of people according to the number of
the children of israel
but the lords portion is his people jacob the lot of his
inheritance
he found him in a desert land in a place of horror and of vast
wilderness he led him about and taught him and he kept him as the
apple of his eye
as the eagle enticing her young to fly and hovering over them
he spread his wings and hath taken him and carried him on his
shoulders
the lord alone was his leader and there was no strange god with
him
he set him upon high land that he might eat the fruits of the
fields that he might suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the
hardest stone
butter of the herd and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs
and of the rams of the breed of basan and goats with the marrow of
wheat and might drink the purest blood of the grape
the beloved grew fat and kicked he grew fat and thick and
gross he forsook god who made him and departed from god his saviour
they provoked him by strange gods and stirred him up to anger
with their abominations
they sacrificed to devils and not to god to gods whom they knew
not that were newly come up whom their fathers worshipped not
thou hast forsaken the god that begot thee and hast forgotten
the lord that created thee
the lord saw and was moved to wrath because his own sons and
daughters provoked him
and he said i will hide my face from them and will consider
what their last end shall be for it is a perverse generation and
unfaithful children
they have provoked me with that which was no god and have
angered me with their vanities and i will provoke them with that which
is no people and will vex them with a foolish nation
a fire is kindled in my wrath and shall burn even to the lowest
hell and shall devour the earth with her increase and shall burn the
foundations of the mountains
i will heap evils upon them and will spend my arrows among them
they shall be consumed with famine and birds shall devour them
with a most bitter bite i will send the teeth of beasts upon them with
the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground and of serpents
without the sword shall lay them waste and terror within both
the young man and the virgin the sucking child with the man in years
i said where are they i will make the memory of them to cease
from among men
but for the wrath of the enemies i have deferred it lest perhaps
their enemies might be proud and should say our mighty hand and not
the lord hath done all these things
they are a nation without counsel and without wisdom
o that they would be wise and would understand and would provide
for their last end
how should one pursue after a thousand and two chase ten
thousand was it not because their god had sold them and the lord had
shut them up
for our god is not as their gods our enemies themselves are
judges
their vines are of the vineyard of sodom and of the suburbs of
bitter
their wine is the gall of dragons and the venom of asps which
is incurable
are not these things stored up with me and sealed up in my
treasures
revenge is mine and i will repay them in due time that their
foot may slide the day of destruction is at hand and the time makes
haste to come
the lord will judge his people and will have mercy on his
servants he shall see that their hand is weakened and that they who
were shut up have also failed and they that remained are consumed
and he shall say where are their gods in whom they trusted
of whose victims they ate the fat and drank the wine of their
drink offerings let them arise and help you and protect you in your
distress
see ye that i alone am and there is no other god besides me i
will kill and i will make to live i will strike and i will heal and
there is none that can deliver out of my hand
i will lift up my hand to heaven and i will say i live for
ever
if i shall whet my sword as the lightning and my hand take hold
on judgment i will render vengeance to my enemies and repay them that
hate me
i will make my arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour
flesh of the blood of the slain and of the captivity of the bare head
of the enemies
praise his people ye nations for he will revenge the blood of
his servants and will render vengeance to their enemies and he will be
merciful to the land of his people
so moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the
ears of the people and josue the son of nun
and he ended all these words speaking to all israel
and he said to them set your hearts on all the words which i
testify to you this day which you shall command your children to
observe and to do and to fulfil all that is written in this law
for they are not commanded you in vain but that every one should
live in them and that doing them you may continue a long time in the
land whither you are going over the jordan to possess it
and the lord spoke to moses the same day saying
go up into this mountain abarim that is to say of passages
unto mount nebo which is in the land of moab over against jericho and
see the land of chanaan which i will deliver to the children of israel
to possess and die thou in the mountain
when thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy
people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gathered to his
people
because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of
and you did not sanctify me among the children of israel
thou shalt see the land before thee which i will give to the
children of israel but thou shalt not enter into it
this is the blessing wherewith the man of god moses blessed the
children of israel before his death
and he said the lord came from sinai and from seir he rose up to
us he hath appeared from mount pharan and with him thousands of
saints in his right hand a fiery law
he hath loved the people all the saints are in his hand and they
that approach to his feet shall receive of his doctrine
moses commanded us a law the inheritance of the multitude of
he shall be king with the most right the princes of the people
being assembled with the tribes of israel
let ruben live and not die and be he small in number
this is the blessing of juda hear o lord the voice of juda and
bring him in unto his people his hands shall fight for him and he
shall be his helper against his enemies
to levi also he said thy perfection and thy doctrine be to thy
holy man whom thou hast proved in the temptation and judged at the
waters of contradiction
who hath said to his father and to his mother i do not know you
and to his brethren i know you not and their own children they have
not known these have kept thy word and observed thy covenant
in such manner as to behave as strangers to their nearest akin when
these would withdraw them from the business of their calling
thy judgments o jacob and thy law o israel they shall put
incense in thy wrath and holocaust upon thy altar
bless o lord his strength and receive the works of his hands
and to benjamin he said the best beloved of the lord shall dwell
confidently in him as in a bride chamber shall he abide all the day
long and between his shoulders shall be rest
the confines of the tribe of benjamin
to joseph also he said of the blessing of the lord be his land
of the fruits of heaven and of the dew and of the deep that lieth
beneath
of the fruits brought forth by the sun and by the moon
of the tops of the ancient mountains of the fruits of the
everlasting hills
and of the fruits of the earth and of the fulness thereof the
blessing of him that appeared in the bush come upon the head of joseph
and upon the crown of the nazarite among his brethren
his beauty as of the firstling of a bullock his horns as the
horns of a rhinoceros with them shall he push the nations even to the
ends of the earth these are the multitudes of ephraim and these the
thousands of manasses
and to zabulon he said rejoice o zabulon in thy going out and
they shall call the people to the mountain there shall they
sacrifice the victims of justice who shall suck as milk the abundance
of the sea and the hidden treasures of the sands
and to gad he said blessed be gad in his breadth he hath rested
as a lion and hath seized upon the arm and the top of the head
and he saw his preeminence that in his portion the teacher was
laid up who was with the princes of the people and did the justices of
the lord and his judgment with israel
alludeth was their having the lawgiver moses buried in their borders
though the particular place was not known
to dan also he said dan is a young lion he shall flow
plentifully from basan
and to nephtali he said nephtali shall enjoy abundance and
shall be full of the blessings of the lord he shall possess the sea and
the south
to aser also he said let aser be blessed with children let him
be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil
his shoe shall be iron and brass as the days of thy youth so
also shall thy old age be
there is no other god like the god of the rightest he that is
mounted upon the heaven is thy helper by his magnificence the clouds
run hither and thither
his dwelling is above and underneath are the everlasting arms
he shall cast out the enemy from before thee and shall say be thou
brought to nought
above in heaven his arms are always stretched out to help us here
below
israel shall dwell in safety and alone the eye of jacob in a
land of corn and wine and the heavens shall be misty with dew
blessed art thou israel who is like to thee o people that art
saved by the lord the shield of thy help and the sword of thy glory
thy enemies shall deny thee and thou shalt tread upon their necks
dieth at the age of years god burieth his body secretly and all
special familiarity with god and for most wonderful miracles is
commended above all other prophets
then moses went up from the plains of moab upon mount nebo to the
top of phasga over against jericho and the lord shewed him all the land
of galaad as far as dan
and all nephtali and the land of ephraim and manasses and all
the land of juda unto the furthermost sea
and the south part and the breadth of the plain of jericho the
city of palm trees as far as segor
and the lord said to him this is the land for which i swore to
seen it with thy eyes and shalt not pass over to it
and moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab
by the commandment of the lord
and he buried him in the valley of the land of moab over against
place of his burial to be unknown lest the israelites who were so
prone to idolatry might worship him with divine honours
moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died his eye was
not dim neither were his teeth moved
and the children of israel mourned for him in the plains of moab
thirty days and the days of their mourning in which they mourned moses
were ended
and josue the son of nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom
because moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israel
obeyed him and did as the lord commanded moses
and there arose no more a prophet in israel like unto moses whom
the lord knew face to face
in all the signs and wonders which he sent by him to do in the
land of egypt to pharao and to all his servants and to his whole land
and all the mighty hand and great miracles which moses did
before all israel
passed under him and according to the common opinion was written by
him the greeks call him jesus for josue and jesus in the hebrew are
the same name and have the same signification viz a saviour and it
was not without a mystery that he who was to bring the people into the
land of promise should have his name changed from osee for so he was
called before num to josue or jesus to give us to understand
that moses by his law could only bring the people within sight of the
promised inheritance but that our saviour jesus was to bring us into
it
