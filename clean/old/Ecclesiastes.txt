the words of ecclesiastes the son of david king of jerusalem
vanity of vanities said ecclesiastes vanity of vanities and all
is vanity
what hath a man more of all his labour that he taketh under the
sun
one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the
earth standeth for ever
the sun riseth and goeth down and returneth to his place and
there rising again
maketh his round by the south and turneth again to the north the
spirit goeth forward surveying all places round about and returneth to
his circuits
all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea doth not overflow
unto the place from whence the rivers come they return to flow again
all things are hard man cannot explain them by word the eye is
not filled with seeing neither is the ear filled with hearing
what is it that hath been the same thing that shall be what is it
that hath been done the same that shall be done
nothing under the sun is new neither is any man able to say
were before us
there is no remembrance of former things nor indeed of those
things which hereafter are to come shall there be any remembrance with
them that shall be in the latter end
i ecclesiastes was king over israel in jerusalem
and i proposed in my mind to seek and search out wisely concerning
all things that are done under the sun this painful occupation hath god
given to the children of men to be exercised therein
i have seen all things that are done under the sun and behold all
is vanity and vexation of spirit
the perverse are hard to be corrected and the number of fools is
infinite
i have spoken in my heart saying behold i am become great and
have gone beyond all in wisdom that were before me in jerusalem and my
mind hath contemplated many things wisely and i have learned
and i have given my heart to know prudence and learning and
errors and folly and i have perceived that in these also there was
labour and vexation of spirit
because in much wisdom there is much indignation and he that
addeth knowledge addeth also labour
i said in my heart i will go and abound with delights and enjoy
good things and i saw that this also was vanity
laughter i counted error and to mirth i said why art thou vainly
deceived
i thought in my heart to withdraw my flesh from wine that i might
turn my mind to wisdom and might avoid folly till i might see what was
profitable for the children of men and what they ought to do under the
sun all the days of their life
i made me great works i built me houses and planted vineyards
i made gardens and orchards and set them with trees of all kinds
and i made me ponds of water to water therewith the wood of the
young trees
i got me menservants and maidservants and had a great family and
herds of oxen and great flocks of sheep above all that were before me
in jerusalem
i heaped together for myself silver and gold and the wealth of
kings and provinces i made me singing men and singing women and the
delights of the sons of men cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine
and i surpassed in riches all that were before me in jerusalem my
wisdom also remained with me
and whatsoever my eyes desired i refused them not and i withheld
not my heart from enjoying every pleasure and delighting itself in the
things which i had prepared and esteemed this my portion to make use
of my own labour
and when i turned myself to all the works which my hands had
wrought and to the labours wherein i had laboured in vain i saw in all
things vanity and vexation of mind and that nothing was lasting under
the sun
i passed further to behold wisdom and errors and folly what is
man said i that he can follow the king his maker
and i saw that wisdom excelled folly as much as light differeth
from darkness
the eyes of a wise man are in his head the fool walketh in
darkness and i learned that they were to die both alike
and i said in my heart if the death of the fool and mine shall be
one what doth it avail me that i have applied myself more to the study
of wisdom and speaking with my own mind i perceived that this also was
vanity
for there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the
fool forever and the times to come shall cover all things together with
oblivion the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned
and therefore i was weary of my life when i saw that all things
under the sun are evil and all vanity and vexation of spirit
again i hated all my application wherewith i had earnestly
laboured under the sun being like to have an heir after me
whom i know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool and he
shall have rule over all my labours with which i have laboured and been
solicitous and is there anything so vain
wherefore i left off and my heart renounced labouring anymore
under the sun
for when a man laboureth in wisdom and knowledge and
carefulness he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man so this also
is vanity and a great evil
for what profit shall a man have of all his labour and vexation
of spirit with which he hath been tormented under the sun
all his days are full of sorrows and miseries even in the night
he doth not rest in mind and is not this vanity
is it not better to eat and drink and to shew his soul good
things of his labours and this is from the hand of god
who shall so feast and abound with delights as i
god hath given to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and
knowledge and joy but to the sinner he hath given vexation and
superfluous care to heap up and to gather together and to give it to
him that hath pleased god but this also is vanity and a fruitless
solicitude of the mind
all things have their season and in their times all things pass
under heaven
a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to
pluck up that which is planted
a time to kill and a time to heal a time to destroy and a time
to build
a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to
dance
a time to scatter stones and a time to gather a time to embrace
and a time to be far from embraces
a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to
cast away
a time to rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a
time to speak
a time of love and a time of hatred a time of war and a time of
peace
what hath man more of his labour
i have seen the trouble which god hath given the sons of men to
be exercised in it
he hath made all things good in their time and hath delivered the
world to their consideration so that man cannot find out the work which
and i have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice
and to do well in this life
for every man that eateth and drinketh and seeth good of his
labour this is the gift of god
i have learned that all the works which god hath made continue
for ever we cannot add any thing nor take away from those things which
that which hath been made the same continueth the things that
shall be have already been and god restoreth that which is past
i saw under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness and in
the place of justice iniquity
and i said in my heart god shall judge both the just and the
wicked and then shall be the time of every thing
i said in my heart concerning the sons of men that god would
prove them and shew them to be like beasts
therefore the death of man and of beasts is one and the
condition of them both is equal as man dieth so they also die all
things breathe alike and man hath nothing more than beast all things
are subject to vanity
and all things go to one place of earth they were made and into
earth they return together
who knoweth if the spirit of the children of adam ascend upward
and if the spirit of the beasts descend downward
see a spirit but as to the spirit of the beasts which is merely
animal and become extinct by the death of the beast who can tell the
manner it acts so as to give life and motion and by death to descend
downward that is to be no more
and i have found that nothing is better than for a man to rejoice
in his work and that this is his portion for who shall bring him to
know the things that shall be after him
i turned myself to other things and i saw the oppressions that are
done under the sun and the tears of the innocent and they had no
comforter and they were not able to resist their violence being
destitute of help from any
and i praised the dead rather than the living
and i judged him happier than them both that is not yet born nor
hath seen the evils that are done under the sun
again i considered all the labours of men and i remarked that
their industries are exposed to the envy of their neighbour so in this
also there is vanity and fruitless care
the fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh
saying
better is a handful with rest than both hands full with labour
and vexation of mind
considering i found also another vanity under the sun
there is but one and he hath not a second no child no brother
and yet he ceaseth not to labour neither are his eyes satisfied with
riches neither doth he reflect saying for whom do i labour and
defraud my soul of good things in this also is vanity and a grievous
vexation
it is better therefore that two should be together than one for
they have the advantage of their society
if one fall he shall be supported by the other woe to him that is
alone for when he falleth he hath none to lift him up
and if two lie together they shall warm one another how shall
one alone be warmed
and if a man prevail against one two shall withstand him a
threefold cord is not easily broken
better is a child that is poor and wise than a king that is old
and foolish who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter
because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a
kingdom and another born king is consumed with poverty
i saw all men living that walk under the sun with the second
young man who shall rise up in his place
the number of the people of all that were before him is infinite
and they that shall come afterwards shall not rejoice in him but this
also is vanity and vexation of spirit
keep thy foot when thou goest into the house of god and draw
nigh to hear for much better is obedience than the victims of fools
who know not what evil they do
moderate use of them is the gift of god
speak not any thing rashly and let not thy heart be hasty to utter
a word before god for god is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore
let thy words be few
dreams follow many cares and in many words shall be found folly
if thou hast vowed any thing to god defer not to pay it for an
unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him but whatsoever thou hast
vowed pay it
and it is much better not to vow than after a vow not to perform
the things promised
give not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin and say not before
the angel there is no providence lest god be angry at thy words and
destroy all the works of thy hands
where there are many dreams there are many vanities and words
without number but do thou fear god
if thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor and violent
judgments and justice perverted in the province wonder not at this
matter for he that is high hath another higher and there are others
still higher than these
moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject
to him
a covetous man shall not be satisfied with money and he that
loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them so this also is vanity
where there are great riches there are also many to eat them and
what doth it profit the owner but that he seeth the riches with his
eyes
sleep is sweet to a labouring man whether he eat little or much
but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep
there is also another grievous evil which i have seen under the
sun riches kept to the hurt of the owner
for they are lost with very great affliction he hath begotten a
son who shall be in extremity of want
as he came forth naked from his mothers womb so shall he return
and shall take nothing away with him of his labour
a most deplorable evil as he came so shall he return what then
doth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind
all the days of his life he eateth in darkness and in many cares
and in misery and sorrow
this therefore hath seemed good to me that a man should eat and
drink and enjoy the fruit of his labour wherewith he hath laboured
under the sun all the days of his life which god hath given him and
this is his portion
and every man to whom god hath given riches and substance and
hath given him power to eat thereof and to enjoy his portion and to
rejoice of his labour this is the gift of god
for he shall not much remember the days of his life because god
entertaineth his heart with delight
there is also another evil which i have seen under the sun and
that frequent among men
a man to whom god hath given riches and substance and honour and
his soul wanteth nothing of all that he desireth yet god doth not give
him power to eat thereof but a stranger shall eat it up this is vanity
and a great misery
if a man beget a hundred children and live many years and attain
to a great age and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance
and he be without burial of this man i pronounce that the untimely
born is better than he
for he came in vain and goeth to darkness and his name shall be
wholly forgotten
he hath not seen the sun nor known the distance of good and evil
although he lived two thousand years and hath not enjoyed good
things do not all make haste to one place
all the labour of man is for his mouth but his soul shall not be
filled
what hath the wise man more than the fool and what the poor man
but to go thither where there is life
better it is to see what thou mayst desire than to desire that
which thou canst not know but this also is vanity and presumption of
spirit
he that shall be his name is already called and it is known
that he is a man and cannot contend in judgment with him that is
stronger than himself
there are many words that have much vanity in disputing
seeking wisdom
what needeth a man to seek things that are above him whereas he
knoweth not what is profitable for him in his life in all the days of
his pilgrimage and the time that passeth like a shadow or who can tell
him what shall be after him under the sun
a good name is better than precious ointments and the day of death
than the day of ones birth
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of
feasting for in that we are put in mind of the end of all and the
living thinketh what is to come
anger is better than laughter because by the sadness of the
countenance the mind of the offender is corrected
the heart of the wise is where there is mourning and the heart of
fools where there is mirth
it is better to be rebuked by a wise man than to be deceived by
the flattery of fools
for as the crackling of thorns burning under a pot so is the
laughter of a fool now this also is vanity
oppression troubleth the wise and shall destroy the strength of
his heart
better is the end of a speech than the beginning better is the
patient man than the presumptuous
be not quickly angry for anger resteth in the bosom of a fool
say not what thinkest thou is the cause that former times were
better than they are now for this manner of question is foolish
wisdom with riches is more profitable and bringeth more advantage
to them that see the sun
for as wisdom is a defence so money is a defence but learning
and wisdom excel in this that they give life to him that possesseth
them
consider the works of god that no man can correct whom he hath
despised
in the good day enjoy good things and beware beforehand of the
evil day for god hath made both the one and the other that man may not
find against him any just complaint
these things also i saw in the days of my vanity a just man
perisheth in his justice and a wicked man liveth a long time in his
wickedness
be not over just and be not more wise than is necessary lest
thou become stupid
in bearing with the wicked
be not overmuch wicked and be not foolish lest thou die before
thy time
leave no room for mercy
it is good that thou shouldst hold up the just yea and from him
withdraw not thy hand for he that feareth god neglecteth nothing
wisdom hath strengthened the wise more than ten princes of the
city
for there is no just man upon earth that doth good and sinneth
not
but do not apply thy heart to all words that are spoken lest
perhaps thou hear thy servant reviling thee
for thy conscience knoweth that thou also hast often spoken evil
of others
i have tried all things in wisdom i have said i will be wise
and it departed farther from me
much more than it was it is a great depth who shall find it out
i have surveyed all things with my mind to know and consider
and seek out wisdom and reason and to know the wickedness of the fool
and the error of the imprudent
and i have found a woman more bitter than death who is the
hunters snare and her heart is a net and her hands are bands he that
pleaseth god shall escape from her but he that is a sinner shall be
caught by her
lo this have i found said ecclesiastes weighing one thing after
another that i might find out the account
which yet my soul seeketh and i have not found it one man among
a thousand i have found a woman among them all i have not found
only this i have found that god made man right and he hath
entangled himself with an infinity of questions who is as the wise man
and who hath known the resolution of the word
unsearchable
the wisdom of a man shineth in his countenance and the most mighty
will change his face
i observe the mouth of the king and the commandments of the oath
of god
be not hasty to depart from his face and do not continue in an
evil work for he will do all that pleaseth him
and his word is full of power neither can any man say to him why
dost thou so
he that keepeth the commandment shall find no evil the heart of a
wiser man understandeth time and answer
there is a time and opportunity for every business and great
affliction for man
because he is ignorant of things past and things to come he cannot
know by any messenger
it is not in mans power to stop the spirit neither hath he power
in the day of death neither is he suffered to rest when war is at hand
neither shall wickedness save the wicked
all these things i have considered and applied my heart to all the
works that are done under the sun sometimes one man ruleth over another
to his own hurt
i saw the wicked buried who also when they were yet living were
in the holy place and were praised in the city as men of just works
but this also is vanity
for because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil
the children of men commit evils without any fear
but though a sinner do evil a hundred times and by patience be
borne withal i know from thence that it shall be well with them that
fear god who dread his face
but let it not be well with the wicked neither let his days be
prolonged but as a shadow let them pass away that fear not the face of
the lord
there is also another vanity which is done upon the earth there
are just men to whom evils happen as though they had done the works of
the wicked and there are wicked men who are as secure as though they
had the deeds of the just but this also i judge most vain
therefore i commended mirth because there was no good for a man
under the sun but to eat and drink and be merry and that he should
take nothing else with him of his labour in the days of his life which
speaks in the person of the libertine representing the objections of
these men against divine providence and the inferences they draw from
thence which he takes care afterwards to refute but it may also be
said that his meaning is to commend the moderate use of the goods of
this world preferably to the cares and solicitudes of worldlings their
attachment to vanity and curiosity and presumptuously diving into the
unsearchable ways of divine providence
and i applied my heart to know wisdom and to understand the
distraction that is upon earth for there are some that day and night
take no sleep with their eyes
and i understood that man can find no reason of all those works of
so much the less shall he find yea though the wise man shall say that
he knoweth it he shall not be able to find it
work or merit
all these things have i considered in my heart that i might
carefully understand them there are just men and wise men and their
works are in the hand of god and yet man knoweth not whether he be
worthy of love or hatred
but all things are kept uncertain for the time to come because all
things equally happen to the just and to the wicked to the good and to
the evil to the clean and to the unclean to him that offereth victims
and to him that despiseth sacrifices as the good is so also is the
sinner as the perjured so he also that sweareth truth
this is a very great evil among all things that are done under the
sun that the same things happen to all men whereby also the hearts of
the children of men are filled with evil and with contempt while they
live and afterwards they shall be brought down to hell
there is no man that liveth always or that hopeth for this a
living dog is better than a dead lion
for the living know that they shall die but the dead know nothing
more neither have they a reward any more for the memory of them is
forgotten
which they have now no part unless it be revealed to them neither have
they any knowledge or power now of doing any thing to secure their
eternal state if they have not taken care of it in their lifetime
nor can they now procure themselves any good as the living always may
do by the grace of god
their love also and their hatred and their envy are all perished
neither have they any part in this world and in the work that is done
under the sun
go then and eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with
gladness because thy works please god
at all times let thy garments be white and let not oil depart from
thy head
live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy
unsteady life which are given to thee under the sun all the time of
thy vanity for this is thy portion in life and in thy labour wherewith
thou labourest under the sun
whatsoever thy hand is able to do do it earnestly for neither
work nor reason nor wisdom nor knowledge shall be in hell whither
thou art hastening
i turned me to another thing and i saw that under the sun the
race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong nor bread to the
wise nor riches to the learned nor favour to the skilful but time and
chance in all
man knoweth not his own end but as fishes are taken with the
hook and as birds are caught with the snare so men are taken in the
evil time when it shall suddenly come upon them
this wisdom also i have seen under the sun and it seemed to me to
be very great
a little city and few men in it there came against it a great
king and invested it and built bulwarks round about it and the siege
was perfect
now there was found in it a man poor and wise and he delivered
the city by his wisdom and no man afterward remembered that poor man
and i said that wisdom is better than strength how then is the
wisdom of the poor man slighted and his words not heard
the words of the wise are heard in silence more than the cry of a
prince among fools
better is wisdom than weapons of war and he that shall offend in
one shall lose many good things
dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment wisdom and glory
is more precious than a small and shortlived folly
the heart of a wise man is in his right hand and the heart of a
fool is in his left hand
yea and the fool when he walketh in the way whereas he himself
is a fool esteemeth all men fools
if the spirit of him that hath power ascend upon thee leave not
thy place because care will make the greatest sins to cease
there is an evil that i have seen under the sun as it were by an
error proceeding from the face of the prince
a fool set in high dignity and the rich sitting beneath
i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking on the
ground as servants
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and he that breaketh a
hedge a serpent shall bite him
he that removeth stones shall be hurt by them and he that
cutteth trees shall be wounded by them
if the iron be blunt and be not as before but be made blunt
with much labour it shall be sharpened and after industry shall follow
wisdom
if a serpent bite in silence he is nothing better that
backbiteth secretly
the words of the mouth of a wise man are grace but the lips of a
fool shall throw him down headlong
the beginning of his words is folly and the end of his talk is a
mischievous error
a fool multiplieth words a man cannot tell what hath been before
him and what shall be after him who can tell him
the labour of fools shall afflict them that know not how to go to
the city
woe to thee o land when thy king is a child and when the
princes eat in the morning
blessed is the land whose king is noble and whose princes eat
in due season for refreshment and not for riotousness
by slothfulness a building shall be brought down and through the
weakness of hands the house shall drop through
for laughter they make bread and wine that the living may feast
and all things obey money
detract not the king no not in thy thought and speak not evil
of the rich man in thy private chamber because even the birds of the
air will carry thy voice and he that hath wings will tell what thou
hast said
and to the remembrance of death and judgment
cast thy bread upon the running waters for after a long time thou
shalt find it again
give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not
what evil shall be upon the earth
if the clouds be full they will pour out rain upon the earth if
the tree fall to the south or to the north in what place soever it
shall fall there shall it be
she comes to heaven or hell and a soul that departs this life in the
state of grace shall never fall from grace as on the other side a
soul that dies out of the state of grace shall never come to it but
this does not exclude a place of temporal punishments for such souls as
die in the state of grace yet not so as to be entirely pure and
therefore they shall be saved indeed yet so as by fire cor

he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that considereth
the clouds shall never reap
as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the
bones are joined together in the womb of her that is with child so thou
knowest not the works of god who is the maker of all
in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening let not thy hand
cease for thou knowest not which may rather spring up this or that
and if both together it shall be the better
the light is sweet and it is delightful for the eyes to see the
sun
if a man live many years and have rejoiced in them all he must
remember the darksome time and the many days which when they shall
come the things past shall be accused of vanity
rejoice therefore o young man in thy youth and let thy heart be
in that which is good in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of
thy heart and in the sight of thy eyes and know that for all these god
will bring thee into judgment
remove anger from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh
things are vain we should fear god and keep his commandments
remember thy creator in the days of thy youth before the time of
affliction come and the years draw nigh of which thou shalt say they
please me not
before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars be
darkened and the clouds return after the rain
upon all the senses and faculties are described in the following verses
under a variety of figures
when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men
shall stagger and the grinders shall be idle in a small number and
they that look through the holes shall be darkened
and they shall shut the doors in the street when the grinders
voice shall be low and they shall rise up at the voice of the bird and
all the daughters of music shall grow deaf
and they shall fear high things and they shall be afraid in the
way the almond tree shall flourish the locust shall be made fat and
the caper tree shall be destroyed because man shall go into the house
of his eternity and the mourners shall go round about in the street
before the silver cord be broken and the golden fillet shrink
back and the pitcher be crushed at the fountain and the wheel be
broken upon the cistern
and the dust return into its earth from whence it was and the
spirit return to god who gave it
vanity of vanities said ecclesiastes and all things are vanity
and whereas ecclesiastes was very wise he taught the people and
declared the things that he had done and seeking out he set forth many
parables
he sought profitable words and wrote words most right and full
of truth
the words of the wise are as goads and as nails deeply fastened
in which by the counsel of masters are given from one shepherd
more than these my son require not of making many books there
is no end and much study is an affliction of the flesh
let us all hear together the conclusion of the discourse fear
and all things that are done god will bring into judgment for
every error whether it be good or evil
excellent of all canticles because it is full of high mysteries
relating to the happy union of christ and his spouse which is here
begun by love and is to be eternal in heaven the spouse of christ is
the church more especially as to the happiest part of it viz perfect
souls every one of which is his beloved but above all others the
immaculate and ever blessed virgin mother
another
let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth for thy breasts are
better than wine
love and have peace with her which the spouse prefers to every thing
delicious and therefore expresses ver that young maidens that is
the souls of the faithful have loved thee
smelling sweet of the best ointments thy name is as oil poured
out therefore young maidens have loved thee
draw me we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments the
king hath brought me into his storerooms we will be glad and rejoice in
thee remembering thy breasts more than wine the rightous love thee
come to thee this metaphor shews that we cannot of ourselves come to
his storerooms that is in the mysteries of faith which god in his
goodness and love for mankind hath revealed first by his servant moses
in the old law in figure only and afterwards in reality by his only
begotten son jesus christ
i am black but beautiful o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents
of cedar as the curtains of solomon
humility appearing outwardly afflicted and as it were black and
contemptible but inwardly that is in its doctrine and morality fair
and beautiful
do not consider me that i am brown because the sun hath altered my
colour the sons of my mother have fought against me they have made me
the keeper in the vineyards my vineyard i have not kept
shew me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where thou
liest in the midday lest i begin to wander after the flocks of thy
companions
if thou know not thyself o fairest among women go forth and
follow after the steps of the flocks and feed thy kids beside the tents
of the shepherds
and watch her flock and though she know not entirely the power at hand
to assist her he tells her ver my company of horsemen that is

verses he reminds her of the virtues and gifts with which he has endowed

mountains skipping over the hills
surmounting difficulties figuratively here expressed by mountains and
little hills

behind our wall looking through the windows looking through the
lattices

revealed his doctrine to them by his watchmen ver that is by the
apostles and teachers by whom they were converted to the true faith

declares ver that she will not let him go till she bring him into
her mothers house etc that is till at last the jews also shall
find him

broad ways i will seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him and i
found him not

loveth i held him and i will not let him go till i bring him into my
mothers house and into the chamber of her that bore me

of the fields that you stir not up nor awake my beloved till she
please

aromatical spices of myrrh and frankincense and of all the powders of
the perfumer

surrounded the bed of solomon
all holding swords and most expert in war every mans sword upon

diadem wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of the joy of his
heart

goats which come up from mount galaad

mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense

infidels in order to convert them to the true faith

spices to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies

assistance and she rejoices at his coming

lilies

with twins and there is none barren among them

within thee

maidens without number

her mother the chosen of her that bore her the daughters saw her and
declared her most blessed the queens and concubines and they praised
her

moon bright as the sun terrible as an army set in array
from the beginning as the morning rising signifying the church before
the written law fair as the moon shewing her under the light of the
gospel and terrible as an army the power of christs church against
its enemies
i went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the
valleys and to look if the vineyard had flourished and the
pomegranates budded
i knew not my soul troubled me for the chariots of aminadab
return return o sulamitess return return that we may behold
thee

thy thighs are like jewels that are made by the hand of a skilful
workman

like a heap of wheat set about with lilies
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins
thy neck as a tower of ivory thy eyes like the fishpools in
nose is as the tower of libanus that looketh toward damascus
thy head is like carmel and the hairs of thy head as the purple of
the king bound in the channels
here signified
how beautiful art thou and how comely my dearest in delights
thy stature is like to a palm tree and thy breasts to clusters of
grapes
i said i will go up into the palm tree and will take hold of the
fruit thereof and thy breasts shall be as the clusters of the vine and
the odour of thy mouth like apples
thy throat like the best wine worthy for my beloved to drink and
for his lips and his teeth to ruminate
i to my beloved and his turning is towards me
come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us abide in
the villages
let us get up early to the vineyards let us see if the vineyard
flourish if the flowers be ready to bring forth fruits if the
pomegranates flourish there will i give thee my breasts
the mandrakes give a smell in our gates are all fruits the new
and the old my beloved i have kept for thee
who shall give thee to me for my brother sucking the breasts of my
mother that i may find thee without and kiss thee and now no man may
despise me
i will take hold of thee and bring thee into my mothers house
there thou shalt teach me and i will give thee a cup of spiced wine and
new wine of my pomegranates

i adjure you o daughters of jerusalem that you stir not up nor
awake my love till she please
who is this that cometh up from the desert flowing with delights
leaning upon her beloved under the apple tree i raised thee up there
thy mother was corrupted there she was defloured that bore thee
converted to the faith coming up from the desert that is coming from
heathenism and false worship flowing with delights that is abounding
with good works which are pleasing to god leaning on her beloved on
the promise of christ to his church that the gates of hell should not
prevail against it and supported by his grace conferred by the
sacraments under the apple tree i raised thee up that is that christ
redeemed the gentiles at the foot of the cross where the synagogue of
the jews the mother church was corrupted by their denying him and
crucifying him
put me as a seal upon thy heart as a seal upon thy arm for love
is strong as death jealousy as hard as hell the lamps thereof are fire
and flames
many waters cannot quench charity neither can the floods drown it
if a man should give all the substance of his house for love he shall
despise it as nothing
our sister is little and hath no breasts what shall we do to our
sister in the day when she is to be spoken to
be spoken to that is converted towards the end of the world and then
shall become a wall that is a part of the building the church of
if she be a wall let us build upon it bulwarks of silver if she
be a door let us join it together with boards of cedar
i am a wall and my breasts are as a tower since i am become in
his presence as one finding peace
the peaceable had a vineyard in that which hath people he let
out the same to keepers every man bringeth for the fruit thereof a
thousand pieces of silver
my vineyard is before me a thousand are for thee the peaceable
and two hundred for them that keep the fruit thereof
thou that dwellest in the gardens the friends hearken make me
hear thy voice
flee away o my beloved and be like to the roe and to the young
hart upon the mountains of aromatical spices
the means to obtain it and the happy fruits it produces it is written
in the person of solomon and contains his sentiments but it is
uncertain who was the writer it abounds with instructions and
exhortations to kings and all magistrates to minister justice in the
commonwealth teaching all kinds of virtues under the general names of
justice and wisdom it contains also many prophecies of christs coming
passion resurrection and other christian mysteries the whole may be
divided into three parts in the first six chapters the author
admonishes all superiors to love and exercise justice and wisdom in the
next three he teacheth that wisdom proceedeth only from god and is
procured by prayer and a good life in the other ten chapters he
sheweth the excellent effects and utility of wisdom and justice
