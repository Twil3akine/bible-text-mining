him the vengeance he is going to take of them by the chaldeans
the burden that habacuc the prophet saw
threaten grievous evils and punishments
how long o lord shall i cry and thou wilt not hear shall i cry
out to thee suffering violence and thou wilt not save
why hast thou shewn me iniquity and grievance to see rapine and
injustice before me and there is a judgment but opposition is more
powerful
therefore the law is torn in pieces and judgment cometh not to the
end because the wicked prevaileth against the just therefore wrong
judgment goeth forth
behold ye among the nations and see wonder and be astonished
for a work is done in your days which no man will believe when it shall
be told
for behold i will raise up the chaldeans a bitter and swift
nation marching upon the breadth of the earth to possess the dwelling
places that are not their own
they are dreadful and terrible from themselves shall their
judgment and their burden proceed
their horses are lighter than leopards and swifter than evening
wolves and their horsemen shall be spread abroad for their horsemen
shall come from afar they shall fly as an eagle that maketh haste to
eat
they shall all come to the prey their face is like a burning wind
and they shall gather together captives as the sand
and their prince shall triumph over kings and princes shall be
his laughingstock and he shall laugh at every strong hold and shall
cast up a mount and shall take it
then shall his spirit be changed and he shall pass and fall
this is his strength of his god
and to the speedy fall of the chaldean empire
wast thou not from the beginning o lord my god my holy one and
we shall not die lord thou hast appointed him for judgment and made
him strong for correction
thy eyes are too pure to behold evil and thou canst not look on
iniquity why lookest thou upon them that do unjust things and holdest
thy peace when the wicked devoureth the man that is more just than
himself
and thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea and as the
creeping things that have no ruler
he lifted up all them with his hook he drew them in his drag and
gathered them into his net for this he will be glad and rejoice
therefore will he offer victims to his drag and he will sacrifice
to his net because through them his portion is made fat and his meat
dainty
for this cause therefore he spreadeth his net and will not spare
continually to slay the nations
people shall assuredly be punished
i will stand upon my watch and fix my foot upon the tower and i
will watch to see what will be said to me and what i may answer to him
that reproveth me
complaint viz that the chaldeans who are worse than the jews and
who attribute all their success to their own strength or to their
idols should nevertheless prevail over the people of the lord the
that all should be set right in due time and the enemies of god and his
people punished according to their deserts
and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it
plain upon tables that he that readeth it may run over it
for as yet the vision is far off and it shall appear at the end
and shall not lie if it make any delay wait for it for it shall surely
come and it shall not be slack
behold he that is unbelieving his soul shall not be right in
himself but the just shall live in his faith
and as wine deceiveth him that drinketh it so shall the proud man
be and he shall not be honoured who hath enlarged his desire like
hell and is himself like death and he is never satisfied but will
gather together unto him all nations and heap together unto him all
people
pleasure followed by the evils and disgrace that are the usual
consequences of drunkenness so shall it be with the proud enemies of
the people of god whose success affordeth them only a momentary
pleasure followed by innumerable and everlasting evils
shall not all these take up a parable against him and a dark
speech concerning him and it shall be said woe to him that heapeth
together that which is not his own how long also doth he load himself
with thick clay
the soul
shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and they be
stirred up that shall tear thee and thou shalt be a spoil to them
because thou hast spoiled many nations all that shall be left of
the people shall spoil thee because of mens blood and for the
iniquity of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein
woe to him that gathereth together an evil covetousness to his
house that his nest may be on high and thinketh he may be delivered
out of the hand of evil
thou hast devised confusion to thy house thou hast cut off many
people and thy soul hath sinned
for the stone shall cry out of the wall and the timber that is
between the joints of the building shall answer
woe to him that buildeth a town with blood and prepareth a city
by iniquity
are not these things from the lord of hosts for the people shall
labour in a great fire and the nations in vain and they shall faint
are here recorded come from the lord upon him that is guilty of such
crimesibid the people shall labour etc viz the enemies of gods
people
for the earth shall be filled that men may know the glory of the
woe to him that giveth drink to his friend and presenteth his
gall and maketh him drunk that he may behold his nakedness
thou art filled with shame instead of glory drink thou also and
fall fast asleep the cup of the right hand of the lord shall compass
thee and shameful vomiting shall be on thy glory
for the iniquity of libanus shall cover thee and the ravaging of
beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of men and the iniquity
of the land and of the city and of all that dwell therein
what doth the graven thing avail because the maker thereof hath
graven it a molten and a false image because the forger thereof hath
trusted in a thing of his own forging to make dumb idols
woe to him that saith to wood awake to the dumb stone arise
can it teach behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there
is no spirit in the bowels thereof
but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence
before him
a prayer of habacuc the prophet for ignorances
is sigionoth which some take to signify a musical instrument or tune
with which this sublime prayer and canticle was to be sung
o lord i have heard thy hearing and was afraid o lord thy
work in the midst of the years bring it to life in the midst of the
years thou shalt make it known when thou art angry thou wilt remember
mercy
thou hast revealed to me and i was struck with a reverential fear and
aweibid thy work the great work of the redemption of man which
thou wilt bring to life and light in the midst of the years when our
calamities and miseries shall be at their height
god will come from the south and the holy one from mount pharan
his law and to conduct us into the true land of promise as heretofore
he came from the south in the hebrew theman and from mount pharan to
give his law to his people in the desert see deut
his brightness shall be as the light horns are in his hands there
is his strength hid
are called horns or beams of light which come forth from his hands or
it may allude to the cross in the horns of which the hands of christ
were fastened where his strength was hidden by which he overcame the
world and drove out death and the devil
death shall go before his face and the devil shall go forth
before his feet
the executioners of his justice against his enemies as they were
heretofore against the egyptians and chanaanites
he stood and measured the earth he beheld and melted the
nations and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces the hills of
the world were bowed down by the journeys of his eternity
and to reduce them to nothing for all heaven and earth disappear when
they come before his light apoc ibid the ancient mountains
etc by the mountains and hills are signified the great ones of the
world that persecute the church whose power was quickly crushed by the
i saw the tents of ethiopia for their iniquity the curtains of the
land of madian shall be troubled
enemies of god and his people who shall perish for their iniquity
wast thou angry o lord with the rivers or was thy wrath upon the
rivers or thy indignation in the sea who will ride upon thy horses
and thy chariots are salvation
the lord in favour of his people israel when the waters of the rivers
viz of arnon and jordan and of the red sea retired before their
face when he came as it were with his horses and chariots to save them
when he took up his bow for their defence in consequene of the oath he
had made to their tribes when the mountains trembled and the deep
stood with its waves raised up in a heap as with hands lifted up to
heaven when the sun and the moon stood still at his command etc to
comply with his anger not against the rivers and sea but against the
enemies of his people how much more will he do in favour of his son
and against the enemies of his church
thou wilt surely take up thy bow according to the oaths which thou
hast spoken to the tribes thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth
the mountains saw thee and were grieved the great body of waters
passed away the deep put forth its voice the deep lifted up its
hands
the sun and the moon stood still in their habitation in the light
of thy arrows they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear
in thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot in thy wrath
thou wilt astonish the nations
thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people for salvation
with thy christ thou struckest the head of the house of the wicked
thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck
shall antichrist be hereafter
thou hast cursed his sceptres the head of his warriors them that
came out as a whirlwind to scatter me their joy was like that of him
that devoureth the poor man in secret
thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses in the mud of many
waters
way to rescue the children of the church from their enemies
i have heard and my bowels were troubled my lips trembled at the
voice let rottenness enter into my bones and swarm under me that i
may rest in the day of tribulation that i may go up to our people that
are girded
impenitent sinners and the foresight that i have of these miseries
makes me willing to die that i may be at rest before this general
tribulation comes in which all good things shall be withdrawn from the
wicked ibid that i may go up to our people etc that i may join the
happy company in the bosom of abraham that are girded that is
prepared for their journey by which they shall attend their lord when
he shall ascend into heaven to which high and happy place my jesus
that is my saviour the great conqueror of death and hell shall one
day conduct me rejoicing and singing psalms of praise ver and
for the fig tree shall not blossom and there shall be no spring
in the vines the labour of the olive tree shall fail and the fields
shall yield no food the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there
shall be no herd in the stalls
but i will rejoice in the lord and i will joy in god my jesus

feet of harts and he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places
