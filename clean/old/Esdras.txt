license to return and build the temple in jerusalem and restoreth the
holy vessels which nabuchodonosor had taken from thence
in the first year of cyrus king of the persians that the word of
the lord by the mouth of jeremias might be fulfilled the lord stirred
up the spirit of cyrus king of the persians and he made a proclamation
throughout all his kingdom and in writing also saying
thus saith cyrus king of the persians the lord the god of heaven
hath given to me all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me
to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judea

him go up to jerusalem which is in judea and build the house of the
and let all the rest in all places wheresoever they dwell help him
every man from his place with silver and gold and goods and cattle
besides that which they offer freely to the temple of god which is in
then rose up the chief of the fathers of juda and benjamin and the
priests and levites and every one whose spirit god had raised up to
go up to build the temple of the lord which was in jerusalem
and all they that were round about helped their hands with vessels
of silver and gold with goods and with beasts and with furniture
besides what they had offered on their own accord
and king cyrus brought forth vessels of the temple of the lord
which nabuchodonosor had taken from jerusalem and had put them in the

these sought the writing of their genealogy and found it not and
they were cast out of the priesthood
and athersatha said to them that they should not eat of the holy
of holies till there arose a priest learned and perfect
all the multitudes as one man were fortytwo thousand three
hundred and sixty
of juda benjamin and levi fall short of this number the rest who
must be taken in to make up the whole sum were of the other tribes
besides their menservants and womenservants of whom there were
seven thousand three hundred and thirtyseven and among them singing
men and singing women two hundred
their horses seven hundred thirtysix their mules two hundred
fortyfive
their camels four hundred thirtyfive their asses six thousand
seven hundred and twenty
and some of the chief of the fathers when they came to the temple
of the lord which is in jerusalem offered freely to the house of the
according to their ability they gave towards the expenses of the
work sixtyone thousand solids of gold five thousand pounds of silver
and a hundred garments for the priests
so the priests and the levites and some of the people and the
singing men and the porters and the nathinites dwelt in their cities
and all israel in their cities
celebrated and the foundations of the temple are laid
and now the seventh month was come and the children of israel were
in their cities and the people gathered themselves together as one man
to jerusalem
and josue the son of josedec rose up and his brethren the priests
and zorobabel the son of salathiel and his brethren and they built the
altar of the god of israel that they might offer holocausts upon it as
it is written in the law of moses the man of god
at that time
and they set the altar of god upon its bases while the people of
the lands round about put them in fear and they offered upon it a
holocaust to the lord morning and evening
and they kept the feast of tabernacles as it is written and
offered the holocaust every day orderly according to the commandment
the duty of the day in its day
and afterwards the continual holocaust both on the new moons and
on all the solemnities of the lord that were consecrated and on all in
which a freewill offering was made to the lord
from the first day of the seventh month they began to offer
holocausts to the lord but the temple of god was not yet founded
and they gave money to hewers of stones and to masons and meat and
drink and oil to the sidonians and tyrians to bring cedar trees from
the persians had given them
and in the second year of their coming to the temple of god in
the son of josedec and the rest of their brethren the priests and the
and they appointed levites from twenty years old and upward to hasten
forward the work of the lord
then josue and his sons and his brethren cedmihel and his sons
and the children of juda as one man stood to hasten them that did the
work in the temple of god the sons of henadad and their sons and
their brethren the levites
and when the masons laid the foundations of the temple of the
and they sung together hymns and praise to the lord because he
is good for his mercy endureth for ever towards israel and all the
people shouted with a great shout praising the lord because the
foundations of the temple of the lord were laid
but many of the priests and the levites and the chief of the
fathers and the ancients that had seen the former temple when they had
the foundation of this temple before their eyes wept with a loud voice
and many shouting for joy lifted up their voice
so that one could not distinguish the voice of the shout of joy
from the noise of the weeping of the people for one with another the
people shouted with a loud shout and the voice was heard afar off
now the enemies of juda and benjamin heard that the children of the
captivity were building a temple to the lord the god of israel
and they came to zorobabel and the chief of the fathers and said
to them let us build with you for we seek your god as ye do behold we
have sacrificed to him since the days of asor haddan king of assyria
who brought us hither
but zorobabel and josue and the rest of the chief of the fathers
of israel said to them you have nothing to do with us to build a house
to our god but we ourselves alone will build to the lord our god as
then the people of the land hindered the hands of the people of
and they hired counsellors against them to frustrate their design
all the days of cyrus king of persia even until the reign of darius
king of the persians
and in the reign of assuerus in the beginning of his reign they
wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of juda and jerusalem
is also in the following verse named artaxerxes a name common to almost
all the kings of persia
and in the days of artaxerxes beselam mithridates and thabeel
and the rest that were in the council wrote to artaxerxes king of the
read in the syrian tongue
reum beelteem and samsai the scribe wrote a letter from jerusalem
to king artaxerxes in this manner
reum beelteem and samsai the scribe and the rest of their
counsellors the dinites and the apharsathacites the therphalites the
and the rest of the nations whom the great and glorious asenaphar
brought over and made to dwell in the cities of samaria and in the rest
of the countries of this side of the river in peace
this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him to
river send greeting
be it known to the king that the jews who came up from thee to
us are come to jerusalem a rebellious and wicked city which they are
building setting up the ramparts thereof and repairing the walls
and now be it known to the king that if this city be built up
and the walls thereof repaired they will not pay tribute nor toll nor
yearly revenues and this loss will fall upon the kings
but we remembering the salt that we have eaten in the palace and
because we count it a crime to see the king wronged have therefore sent
and certified the king
that search may be made in the books of the histories of thy
fathers and thou shalt find written in the records and shalt know that
this city is a rebellious city and hurtful to the kings and provinces
and that wars were raised therein of old time for which cause also the
city was destroyed
we certify the king that if this city be built and the walls
thereof repaired thou shalt have no possession on this side of the
river
the king sent word to reum beelteem and samsai the scribe and to
the rest that were in their council inhabitants of samaria and to the
rest beyond the river sending greeting and peace
the accusation which you have sent to us hath been plainly read
before me
and i commanded and search hath been made and it is found that
this city of old time hath rebelled against kings and seditions and
wars have been raised therein
for there have been powerful kings in jerusalem who have had
dominion over all the country that is beyond the river and have
received tribute and toll and revenues
now therefore hear the sentence hinder those men that this city
be not built till further orders be given by me
see that you be not negligent in executing this lest by little
and little the evil grow to the hurt of the kings
now the copy of the edict of king artaxerxes was read before reum
in haste to jerusalem to the jews and hindered them with arm and power
then the work of the house of the lord in jerusalem was
interrupted and ceased till the second year of the reign of darius king
of the persians
building the temple which their enemies strive in vain to hinder
now aggeus the prophet and zacharias the son of addo prophesied
to the jews that were in judea and jerusalem in the name of the god of
then rose up zorobabel the son of salathiel and josue the son of
them were the prophets of god helping them
and at the same time came to them thathanai who was governor
beyond the river and stharbuzanai and their counsellors and said thus
to them who hath given you counsel to build this house and to repair
the walls thereof
in answer to which we gave them the names of the men who were the
promoters of that building
but the eye of their god was upon the ancients of the jews and
they could not hinder them and it was agreed that the matter should be
referred to darius and then they should give satisfaction concerning
that accusation
the copy of the letter that thathanai governor of the country
beyond the river and stharbuzanai and his counsellors the
the letter which they sent him was written thus to darius the
king all peace
be it known to the king that we went to the province of judea to
the house of the great god which they are building with unpolished
stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work is carried on
diligently and advanceth in their hands
and we asked those ancients and said to them thus who hath given
you authority to build this house and to repair these walls
we asked also of them their names that we might give thee notice
and we have written the names of the men that are the chief among them
and they answered us in these words saying we are the servants
of the god of heaven and earth and we are building a temple that was
built these many years ago and which a great king of israel built and
set up
but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven to
wrath he delivered them into the hands of nabuchodonosor the king of
people to babylon
but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon king cyrus set
forth a decree that this house of god should be built
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the temple of god
which nabuchodonosor had taken out of the temple that was in jerusalem
and had brought them to the temple of babylon king cyrus brought out of
the temple of babylon and they were delivered to one sassabasar whom
also he appointed governor
and said to him take these vessels and go and put them in the
temple that is in jerusalem and let the house of god be built in its
place
then came this same sassabasar and laid the foundations of the
temple of god in jerusalem and from that time until now it is in
building and is not yet finished
now therefore if it seem good to the king let him search in the
kings library which is in babylon whether it hath been decreed by
let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter
then king darius gave orders and they searched in the library of
the books that were laid up in babylon
and there was found in ecbatana which is a castle in the province
of media a book in which this record was written
in the first year of cyrus the king cyrus the king decreed that
the house of god should be built which is in jerusalem in the place
where they may offer sacrifices and that they lay the foundations that
may support the height of threescore cubits and the breadth of
threescore cubits
three rows of unpolished stones and so rows of new timber and the
charges shall be given out of the kings house
and also let the golden and silver vessels of the temple of god
which nabuchodonosor took out of the temple of jerusalem and brought to
their place which also were placed in the temple of god
now therefore thathanai governor of the country beyond the river
river depart far from them
and let that temple of god be built by the governor of the jews
and by their ancients that they may build that house of god in its
place
i also have commanded what must be done by those ancients of the
chest that is of the tribute that is paid out of the country beyond
the river the charges be diligently given to those men lest the work
be hindered
and if it shall be necessary let calves also and lambs and kids
for holocausts to the god of heaven wheat salt wine and oil
according to the custom of the priests that are in jerusalem be given
them day by day that there be no complaint in any thing
and let them offer oblations to the god of heaven and pray for
the life of the king and of his children
and i have made a decree that if any whosoever shall alter this
commandment a beam be taken from his house and set up and he be
nailed upon it and his house be confiscated
and may the god that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy
all kingdoms and the people that shall put out their hand to resist
and to destroy the house of god that is in jerusalem i darius have
made the decree which i will have diligently complied with
so then thathanai governor of the country beyond the river and
king had commanded
and the ancients of the jews built and prospered according to the
prophecy of aggeus the prophet and of zacharias the son of addo and
they built and finished by the commandment of the god of israel and by
the commandment of cyrus and darius and artaxerxes kings of the
and they were finishing this house of god until the third day of
the month of adar which was in the sixth year of the reign of king
and the children of israel the priests and the levites and the
rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of the house
of god with joy
and they offered at the dedication of the house of god a hundred
calves two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sin offering for
all israel twelve hegoats according to the number of the tribes of
and they set the priests in their divisions and the levites in
their courses over the works of god in jerusalem as it is written in
the book of moses
and the children of israel of the captivity kept the phase on the
fourteenth day of the first month
for all the priests and the levites were purified as one man all
were clean to kill the phase for all the children of the captivity and
for their brethren the priests and themselves
and the children of israel that were returned from captivity and
all that had separated themselves from the filthiness of the nations of
the earth to them to seek the lord the god of israel did eat
and they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy
for the lord had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king
of assyria to them that he should help their hands in the work of the
house of the lord the god of israel
gracious decree of artaxerxes
now after these things in the reign of artaxerxes king of the
the son of sellum the son of sadoc the son of achitob
the son of amarias the son of azarias the son of maraioth
the son of zarahias the son of ozi the son of bocci
the son of abisue the son of phinees the son of eleazar the son
of aaron the priest from the beginning
this esdras went up from babylon and he was a ready scribe in the
law of moses which the lord god had given to israel and the king
granted him all his request according to the hand of the lord his god
upon him
and there went up some of the children of israel and of the
children of the priests and of the children of the levites and of the
singing men and of the porters and of the nathinites to jerusalem in
the seventh year of artaxerxes the king
and they came to jerusalem in the fifth month in the seventh year
of the king
for upon the first day of the first month he began to go up from
according to the good hand of his god upon him
for esdras had prepared his heart to seek the law of the lord and
to do and to teach in israel the commandments and judgment
and this is the copy of the letter of the edict which king
and commandments of the lord and his ceremonies in israel
artaxerxes king of kings to esdras the priest the most learned
scribe of the law of the god of heaven greeting
it is decreed by me that all they of the people of israel and of
the priests and of the levites in my realm that are minded to go into
for thou art sent from before the king and his seven counsellors
to visit judea and jerusalem according to the law of thy god which is
in thy hand
and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his
counsellors have freely offered to the god of israel whose tabernacle
is in jerusalem
and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the
province of babylon and that the people is willing to offer and that
the priests shall offer of their own accord to the house of their god
which is in jerusalem
take freely and buy diligently with this money calves rams
lambs with the sacrifices and libations of them and offer them upon
the altar of the temple of your god that is in jerusalem
and if it seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do any thing
with the rest of the silver and gold do it according to the will of
your god
the vessels also that are given thee for the sacrifice of the
house of thy god deliver thou in the sight of god in jerusalem
and whatsoever more there shall be need of for the house of thy
given out of the treasury and the kings exchequer and by me
i artaxerxes the king have ordered and decreed to all the keepers
of the public chest that are beyond the river that whatsoever esdras
the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven shall require of
you you give it without delay
unto a hundred talents of silver and unto a hundred cores of
wheat and unto a hundred bates of wine and unto a hundred bates of
oil and salt without measure
all that belongeth to the rites of the god of heaven let it be
given diligently in the house of the god of heaven lest his wrath
should be enkindled against the realm of the king and of his sons
we give you also to understand concerning all the priests and the
ministers of the house of this god that you have no authority to impose
toll or tribute or custom upon them
and thou esdras according to the wisdom of thy god which is in
thy hand appoint judges and magistrates that may judge all the people
that is beyond the river that is for them who know the law of thy god
yea and the ignorant teach ye freely
and whosoever will not do the law of thy god and the law of the
king diligently judgment shall be executed upon him either unto death
or unto banishment or to the confiscation of goods or at least to
prison
blessed be the lord the god of our fathers who hath put this in
the kings heart to glorify the house of the lord which is in
and hath inclined his mercy toward me before the king and his
counsellors and all the mighty princes of the king and i being
strengthened by the hand of the lord my god which was upon me gathered
together out of israel chief men to go up with me
holy vessels into the temple
now these are the chief of families and the genealogy of them who
came up with me from babylon in the reign of artaxerxes the king
of the sons of phinees gersom of the sons of ithamar daniel of
the sons of david hattus
of the sons of sechenias the son of pharos zacharias and with
him were numbered a hundred and fifty men
of the sons of phahath moab eleoenai the son of zareha and with
him two hundred men
of the sons of sechenias the son of ezechiel and with him three
hundred men
of the sons of adan abed the son of jonathan and with him fifty
men
of the sons of alam isaias the son of athalias and with him
seventy men
of the sons of saphatia zebodia the son of michael and with him
eighty men
of the sons of joab obedia the son of jahiel and with him two
hundred and eighteen men
of the sons of selomith the son of josphia and with him a
hundred and sixty men
of the sons of bebai zacharias the son of bebai and with him
eight and twenty men
of the sons of azgad joanan the son of eccetan and with him a
hundred and ten men
of the sons of adonicam who were the last and these are their
names eliphelet and jehiel and samaias and with them sixty men
of the sons of begui uthai and zachur and with them seventy men
and i gathered them together to the river which runneth down to
among the priests for the sons of levi and found none there
so i sent eliezer and ariel and semeias and elnathan and
chief men and joiarib and elnathan wise men
and i sent them to eddo who is chief in the place of chasphia
and i put in their mouth the words that they should speak to eddo and
his brethren the nathinites in the place of chasphia that they should
bring us ministers of the house of our god
and by the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a most
learned man of the sons of moholi the son of levi the son of israel and
and hasabias and with him isaias of the sons of merari and his
brethren and his sons twenty
and of the nathinites whom david and the princes gave for the
service of the levites nathinites two hundred and twenty all these
were called by their names
and i proclaimed there a fast by the river ahava that we might
afflict ourselves before the lord our god and might ask of him a right
way for us and for our children and for all our substance
is figuratively from sin but we must also do works of penance and
therefore esdras here proclaimed an extraordinary fast to those that
were come from captivity this shews that fasting was commanded and
practised from the earliest times
for i was ashamed to ask the king for aid and for horsemen to
defend us from the enemy in the way because we had said to the king
power and strength and wrath upon all them that forsake him
and we fasted and besought our god for this and it fell out
prosperously unto us
and i separated twelve of the chief of the priests sarabias and
and i weighed unto them the silver and gold and the vessels
consecrated for the house of our god which the king and his
counsellors and his princes and all israel that were found had
offered
and i weighed to their hands six hundred and fifty talents of
silver and a hundred vessels of silver and a hundred talents of gold
and twenty cups of gold of a thousand solids and two vessels of
the best shining brass beautiful as gold
and i said to them you are the holy ones of the lord and the
vessels are holy and the silver and gold that is freely offered to the
watch ye and keep them till you deliver them by weight before the
chief of the priests and of the levites and the heads of the families
of israel in jerusalem into the treasure of the house of the lord
and the priests and the levites received the weight of the silver
and gold and the vessels to carry them to jerusalem to the house of
our god
then we set forward from the river ahava on the twelfth day of the
first month to go to jerusalem and the hand of our god was upon us and
delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such as lay in wait by
the way
and we came to jerusalem and we stayed there three days
and on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels
were weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of
them jozabad the son of josue and noadaia the son of benoi levites
according to the number and weight of everything and all the
weight was written at that time
moreover the children of them that had been carried away that were
come out of the captivity offered holocausts to the god of israel
twelve calves for all the people of israel ninetysix rams seventy
seven lambs and twelve hegoats for sin all for a holocaust to the
and they gave the kings edicts to the lords that were from the
kings court and the governors beyond the river and they furthered the
people and the house of god
prayer
and after these things were accomplished the princes came to me
saying the people of israel and the priests and levites have not
separated themselves from the people of the lands and from their
abominations namely of the chanaanites and the hethites and the
the egyptians and the amorrhites
forbids us on account of the danger of perversion and falling off from
the true faith
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their
sons and they have mingled the holy seed with the people of the lands
transgression
and when i had heard this word i rent my mantle and my coat and
plucked off the hairs of my head and my beard and i sat down mourning
and there were assembled to me all that feared the god of israel
because of the transgression of those that were come from the captivity
and i sat sorrowful until the evening sacrifice
and at the evening sacrifice i rose up from my affliction and
having rent my mantle and my garment i fell upon my knees and spread
out my hands to the lord my god
and said my god i am confounded and ashamed to lift up my face to
thee for our iniquities are multiplied over our heads and our sins are
grown up even unto heaven
from the days of our fathers and we ourselves also have sinned
grievously unto this day and for our iniquities we and our kings and
our priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the
lands and to the sword and to captivity and to spoil and to
confusion of face as it is at this day
and now as a little and for a moment has our prayer been made
before the lord our god to leave us a remnant and give us a pin in his
holy place and that our god would enlighten our eyes and would give us
a little life in our bondage
great iniquity had incurred the anger of god
for we are bondmen and in our bondage our god hath not forsaken
us but hath extended mercy upon us before the king of the persians to
give us life and to set up the house of our god and to rebuild the
desolations thereof and to give us a fence in juda and jerusalem
and now o our god what shall we say after this for we have
forsaken thy commandments
which thou hast commanded by the hand of thy servants the
prophets saying the land which you go to possess is an unclean land
according to the uncleanness of the people and of other lands with
their abominations who have filled it from mouth to mouth with their
filth
now therefore give not your daughters to their sons and take not
their daughters for your sons and seek not their peace nor their
prosperity for ever that you may be strengthened and may eat the good
things of the land and may have your children your heirs for ever
and after all that is come upon us for our most wicked deeds and
our great sin seeing that thou our god hast saved us from our iniquity
and hast given us a deliverance as at this day
that we should not turn away nor break thy commandments nor join
in marriage with the people of these abominations art thou angry with
us unto utter destruction not to leave us a remnant to be saved
o lord god of israel thou art just for we remain yet to be saved
as at this day behold we are before thee in our sin for there can be
no standing before thee in this matter
now when esdras was thus praying and beseeching and weeping and
lying before the temple of god there was gathered to him of israel an
exceeding great assembly of men and women and children and the people
wept with much lamentation
and sechenias the son of jehiel of the sons of elam answered and
said to esdras we have sinned against our god and have taken strange
wives of the people of the land and now if there be repentance in
let us make a covenant with the lord our god to put away all the
wives and such as are born of them according to the will of the lord
and of them that fear the commandment of the lord our god let it be
done according to the law
arise it is thy part to give orders and we will be with thee
take courage and do it
so esdras arose and made the chiefs of the priests and of the
word and they swore
and esdras rose up from before the house of god and went to the
chamber of johanan the son of eliasib and entered in thither he ate no
bread and drank no water for he mourned for the transgression of them
that were come out of the captivity
and proclamation was made in juda and jerusalem to all the
children of the captivity that they should assemble together into
and that whosoever would not come within three days according to
the counsel of the princes and the ancients all his substance should be
taken away and he should be cast out of the company of them that were
returned from captivity
then all the men of juda and benjamin gathered themselves
together to jerusalem within three days in the ninth month the
twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the street of the
house of god trembling because of the sin and the rain
and esdras the priest stood up and said to them you have
transgressed and taken strange wives to add to the sins of israel
and now make confession to the lord the god of your fathers and
do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the land
and from your strange wives
and all the multitude answered and said with a loud voice
but as the people are many and it is time of rain and we are
not able to stand without and it is not a work of one day or two for
we have exceedingly sinned in this matter
let rulers be appointed in all the multitude and in all our
cities let them that have taken strange wives come at the times
appointed and with them the ancients and the judges of every city
until the wrath of our god be turned away from us for this sin
then jonathan the son of azahel and jaasia the son of thecua
were appointed over this and mesollam and sebethai levites helped
them
and the children of the captivity did so and esdras the priest
and the men heads of the families in the houses of their fathers and
all by their names went and sat down in the first day of the tenth
month to examine the matter
and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange
wives by the first day of the first month
and there were found among the sons of the priests that had taken
strange wives of the sons of josue the son of josedec and his
brethren maasia and eliezer and jarib and godolia
and they gave their hands to put away their wives and to offer
for their offence a ram of the flock
and of the sons of emmer hanani and zebedia
and of the sons of harim maasia and elia and semeia and
and of the sons of pheshur elioenai maasia ismael nathanael
and of the sons of the levites jozabed and semei and celaia
the same is calita phataia juda and eliezer
and of the singing men elisiab and of the porters sellum and
and of israel of the sons of pharos remeia and jezia and
and of the sons of elam mathania zacharias and jehiel and
and of the sons of zethua elioenai eliasib mathania jerimuth
and zabad and aziaza
and of the sons of babai johanan hanania zabbai athalai
and of the sons of bani mosollam and melluch and adaia jasub
and saal and ramoth
and of the sons of phahath moab edna and chalal banaias and
and of the sons of herem eliezer josue melchias semeias

and joel and banaia
all these had taken strange wives and there were among them
women that had borne children
with a commission to rebuild the walls of jerusalem it is also called
the second book of esdras because it is a continuation of the history
begun by esdras of the state of the people of god after their return
from captivity
lamenteth fasteth and prayeth to god for their relief
the words of nehemias the son of helchias and it came to pass in
the month of casleu in the twentieth year as i was in the castle of
that hanani one of my brethren came he and some men of juda and i
asked them concerning the jews that remained and were left of the
captivity and concerning jerusalem
and they said to me they that have remained and are left of the
captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach
and the wall of jerusalem is broken down and the gates thereof are
burnt with fire
and when i had heard these words i sat down and wept and mourned
for many days and i fasted and prayed before the face of the god of
heaven
and i said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven strong great
and terrible who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee
and keep thy commandments
let thy ears be attentive and thy eyes open to hear the prayer of
thy servant which i pray before thee now night and day for the
children of israel thy servants and i confess the sins of the children
of israel by which they have sinned against thee i and my fathers
house have sinned
we have been seduced by vanity and have not kept thy commandments
and ceremonies and judgments which thou hast commanded thy servant
remember the word that thou commandedst to moses thy servant
saying if you shall transgress i will scatter you abroad among the
nations
but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them
though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the world i
will gather you from thence and bring you back to the place which i
have chosen for my name to dwell there
and these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast
redeemed by thy great strength and by thy mighty hand
i beseech thee o lord let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of
thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy
name and direct thy servant this day and give him mercy before this
man for i was the kings cupbearer
exhorteth the jews to rebuild the walls
and it came to pass in the month of nisan in the twentieth year of
and gave it to the king and i was as one languishing away before his
face
and the king said to me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou
dost not appear to be sick this is not without cause but some evil i
know not what is in thy heart and i was seized with an exceeding great
fear
and i said to the king o king live for ever why should not my
countenance be sorrowful seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres
of my fathers is desolate and the gates thereof are burnt with fire
then the king said to me for what dost thou make request and i
prayed to the god of heaven
and i said to the king if it seem good to the king and if thy
servant hath found favour in thy sight that thou wouldst send me into
and the king said to me and the queen that sat by him for how
long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return and it pleased the
king and he sent me and i fixed him a time
and i said to the king if it seem good to the king let him give
me letters to the governors of the country beyond the river that they
convey me over till i come into judea
and a letter to asaph the keeper of the kings forest to give me
timber that i may cover the gates of the tower of the house and the
walls of the city and the house that i shall enter into and the king
gave me according to the good hand of my god with me
and i came to the governors of the country beyond the river and
gave them the kings letters and the king had sent with me captains of
soldiers and horsemen
and sanaballat the horonite and tobias the servant the ammonite
heard it and it grieved them exceedingly that a man was come who
sought the prosperity of the children of israel
and i came to jerusalem and was there three days
and i arose in the night i and some few men with me and i told
not any man what god had put in my heart to do in jerusalem and there
was no beast with me but the beast that i rode upon
and i went out by night by the gate of the valley and before the
dragon fountain and to the dung gate and i viewed the wall of
consumed with fire
and i passed to the gate of the fountain and to the kings
aqueduct and there was no place for the beast on which i rode to pass
and i went up in the night by the torrent and viewed the wall
and going back i came to the gate of the valley and returned
but the magistrates knew not whither i went or what i did
neither had i as yet told any thing to the jews or to the priests or
to the nobles or to the magistrates or to the rest that did the work
then i said to them you know the affliction wherein we are
because jerusalem is desolate and the gates thereof are consumed with
fire come and let us build up the walls of jerusalem and let us be no
longer a reproach
and i shewed them how the hand of my god was good with me and the
kings words which he had spoken to me and i said let us rise up and
build and their hands were strengthened in good
but sanaballat the horonite and tobias the servant the ammonite
and gossem the arabian heard of it and they scoffed at us and despised
us and said what is this thing that you do are you going to rebel
against the king
and i answered them and said to them the god of heaven he
helpeth us and we are his servants let us rise up and build but you
have no part nor justice nor remembrance in jerusalem
then eliasib the high priest arose and his brethren the priests
and they built the flock gate they sanctified it and set up the doors
thereof even unto the tower of a hundred cubits they sanctified it unto
the tower of hananeel
and next to him the men of jericho built and next to them built
but the fish gate the sons of asnaa built they covered it and set
up the doors thereof and the locks and the bars and next to them
built marimuth the son of urias the son of accus
and next to him built mosollam the son of barachias the son of
and next to them the thecuites built but their great men did not put

and joiada the son of phasea and mosollam the son of besodia built
the old gate they covered it and set up the doors thereof and the
locks and the bars
and next to them built meltias the gabaonite and jadon the

and next to him built sellum the son of alohes lord of half the
street of jerusalem he and his daughters
and the gate of the valley hanun built and the inhabitants of
the bars and a thousand cubits in the wall unto the gate of the
dunghill
and the gate of the dunghill melchias the son of rechab built
lord of the street of bethacharam he built it and set up the doors
thereof and the locks and the bars
and the gate of the fountain sellum the son of cholhoza built
lord of the street of maspha he built it and covered it and set up
the doors thereof and the locks and the bars and the walls of the
pool of siloe unto the kings guard and unto the steps that go down
from the city of david
after him built nehemias the son of azboc lord of half the street
of bethsur as far as over against the sepulchre of david and to the
pool that was built with great labour and to the house of the mighty
after him built the levites rehum the son of benni after him
built hasebias lord of half the street of ceila in his own street
after him built their brethren bavai the son of enadad lord of
half ceila
and next to him aser the son of josue lord of maspha built
another measure over against the going up of the strong corner
after him in the mount baruch the son of zachai built another
measure from the corner to the door of the house of eliasib the high
priest
after him merimuth the son of urias the son of haccus built
another measure from the door of the house of eliasib to the end of
the house of eliasib
and after him built the priests the men of the plains of the
after him built benjamin and hasub over against their own house
and after him built azarias the son of maasias the son of ananias over
against his house
after him built bennui the son of hanadad another measure from
the house of azarias unto the bending and unto the corner
phalel the son of ozi over against the bending and the tower
which lieth out from the kings high house that is in the court of the
prison after him phadaia the son of pharos
and the nathinites dwelt in ophel as far as over against the
water gate toward the east and the tower that stood out
after him the thecuites built another measure over against from
the great tower that standeth out unto the wall of the temple
and upward from the horse gate the priests built every man over
against his house
after them built sadoc the son of emmer over against his house

after him built hanania the son of selemia and hanun the sixth
son of seleph another measure after him built mosollam the son of
son built unto the house of the nathinites and of the sellers of small
wares over against the judgment gate and unto the chamber of the
corner
and within the chamber of the corner of the flock gate the
goldsmiths and the merchants built
enemies
and it came to pass that when sanaballat heard that we were
building the wall he was angry and being moved exceedingly he scoffed
at the jews
and said before his brethren and the multitude of the samaritans
they sacrifice and make an end in a day are they able to raise stones
out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burnt
tobias also the ammonite who was by him said let them build if a
fox go up he will leap over their stone wall
hear thou our god for we are despised turn their reproach upon
their own head and give them to be despised in a land of captivity
cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from
before thy face because they have mocked thy builders
so we built the wall and joined it all together unto the half
thereof and the heart of the people was excited to work
and it came to pass when sanaballat and tobias and the arabians
and the ammonites and the azotians heard that the walls of jerusalem
were made up and the breaches began to be closed that they were
exceedingly angry
and they all assembled themselves together to come and to fight
against jerusalem and to prepare ambushes
and we prayed to our god and set watchmen upon the wall day and
night against them
and juda said the strength of the bearer of burdens is decayed
and the rubbish is very much and we shall not be able to build the
wall
and our enemies said let them not know nor understand till we
come in the midst of them and kill them and cause the work to cease
and it came to pass that when the jews that dwelt by them came
and told us ten times out of all the places from whence they came to
us
i set the people in the place behind the wall round about in
order with their swords and spears and bows
and i looked and rose up and i said to the chief men and the
magistrates and to the rest of the common people be not afraid of
them remember the lord who is great and terrible and fight for your
brethren your sons and your daughters and your wives and your
houses
and it came to pass when our enemies heard that the thing had
been told us that god defeated their counsel and we returned all of us
to the walls every man to his work
and it came to pass from that day forward that half of their
young men did the work and half were ready for to fight with spears
and shields and bows and coats of mail and the rulers were behind
them in all the house of juda
of them that built on the wall and that carried burdens and that
laded with one of his hands he did the work and with the other he held
a sword
for every one of the builders was girded with a sword about his
reins and they built and sounded with a trumpet by me
and i said to the nobles and to the magistrates and to the rest
of the common people the work is great and wide and we are separated
on the wall one far from another
in what place soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet run
all thither unto us our god will fight for us
and let us do the work and let one half of us hold our spears
from the rising of the morning till the stars appear
at that time also i said to the people let every one with his
servant stay in the midst of jerusalem and let us take our turns in the
night and by day to work
now i and my brethren and my servants and the watchmen that
followed me did not put off our clothes only every man stripped
himself when he was to be washed
exhortation and bounty to his countrymen
now there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
their brethren the jews
and there were some that said our sons and our daughters are very
many let us take up corn for the price of them and let us eat and
live
and there were some that said let us mortgage our lands and our
vineyards and our houses and let us take corn because of the famine
and others said let us borrow money for the kings tribute and
let us give up our fields and vineyards
and now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren and our children
as their children behold we bring into bondage our sons and our
daughters and some of our daughters are bondwomen already neither have
we wherewith to redeem them and our fields and our vineyards other men
possess
and i was exceedingly angry when i heard their cry according to
these words
and my heart thought with myself and i rebuked the nobles and
magistrates and said to them do you every one exact usury of your
brethren and i gathered together a great assembly against them
and i said to them we as you know have redeemed according to our
ability our brethren the jews that were sold to the gentiles and will
you then sell your brethren for us to redeem them and they held their
peace and found not what to answer
and i said to them the thing you do is not good why walk you not
in the fear of our god that we be not exposed to the reproaches of the
both i and my brethren and my servants have lent money and corn
to many let us all agree not to call for it again let us forgive the
debt that is owing to us
restore ye to them this day their fields and their vineyards and
their oliveyards and their houses and the hundredth part of the money
and of the corn the wine and the oil which you were wont to exact of
them give it rather for them
and they said we will restore and we will require nothing of
them and we will do as thou sayest and i called the priests and took
an oath of them to do according to what i had said
moreover i shook my lap and said so may god shake every man that
shall not accomplish this word out of his house and out of his
labours thus may he be shaken out and become empty and all the
multitude said amen and they praised god and the people did according
to what was said
and from the day in which the king commanded me to be governor in
the land of juda from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth
year of artaxerxes the king for twelve years i and my brethren did not
eat the yearly allowance that was due to the governors
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable
to the people and took of them in bread and wine and in money every
day forty sicles and their officers also oppressed the people but i
did not so for the fear of god
moreover i built in the work of the wall and i bought no land
and all my servants were gathered together to the work
the jews also and the magistrates to the number of one hundred and
fifty men were at my table besides them that came to us from among the
nations that were round about us
and there was prepared for me day be day one ox and six choice
rams besides fowls and once in ten days i gave store of divers wines
and many other things yet i did not require my yearly allowance as
governor for the people were very much impoverished
remember me o my god for good according to all that i have done
for this people
wall
and it came to pass when sanaballat and tobias and gossem the
and that there was no breach left in it though at that time i had not
set up the doors in the gates
sanaballat and gossem sent to me saying come and let us make a
league together in the villages in the plain of ono but they thought
to do me mischief
and i sent messengers to them saying i am doing a great work and
you
and they sent to me according to this word four times and i
answered them after the same manner
and sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to
the former word and he had a letter in his hand written in this manner
it is reported amongst the gentiles and gossem hath said it that
thou and the jews think to rebel and therefore thou buildest the wall
and hast a mind to set thyself king over them for which end
thou hast also set up prophets to preach of thee at jerusalem
saying there is a king in judea the king will hear of these things
therefore come now that we may take counsel together
and i sent to them saying there is no such thing done as thou
sayest but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart
for all these men thought to frighten us thinking that our hands
would cease from the work and that we would leave off wherefore i
strengthened my hands the more
and i went into the house of samaia the son of delaia the son of
for they will come to kill thee and in the night they will come to slay
thee
and i said should such a man as i flee and who is there that
being as i am would go into the temple to save his life i will not
go in
and i understood that god had not sent him but that he had spoken
to me as if he had been prophesying and tobias and sanaballat had
hired him
for he had taken money that i being afraid should do this thing
and sin and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal
remember me o lord for tobias and sanaballat according to their
works of this kind and noadias the prophet and the rest of the
prophets that would have put me in fear
but the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month
of elul in two and fifty days
and it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it that all
nations which were round about us were afraid and were cast down
within themselves for they perceived that this work was the work of
moreover in those days many letters were sent by the principal men
of the jews to tobias and from tobias there came letters to them
for there were many in judea sworn to him because he was the son
inlaw of sechenias the son of area and johanan his son had taken to
wife the daughter of mosollam the son of barachias
and they praised him also before me and they related my words to
him and tobias sent letters to put me in fear
first from babylon
now after the wall was built and i had set up the doors and
numbered the porters and singing men and levites
i commanded hanani my brother and hananias ruler of the house of
above the rest
and i said to them let not the gates of jerusalem be opened till
the sun be hot and while they were yet standing by the gates were shut
and barred and i set watchmen of the inhabitants of jerusalem every
one by their courses and every man over against his house
and the city was very wide and great and the people few in the
midst thereof and the houses were not built
but god had put in my heart and i assembled the princes and
magistrates and common people to number them and i found a book of
the number of them who came up at first and therein it was found
written

he was so called at the court of the king of persia where he was
cupbearer or that as some think this name signifies governor and he
was at that time governor of judea
and some of the heads of families gave to the treasure of the
work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand two hundred pounds
of silver
and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
drams of gold and two thousand pounds of silver and sixtyseven
garments for priests
and the priests and the levites and the porters and the singing
men and the rest of the common people and the nathinites and all
celebrate the feast of tabernacles
and the seventh month came and the children of israel were in
their cities and all the people were gathered together as one man to
the street which is before the water gate and they spoke to esdras the
scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had
commanded to israel
then esdras the priest brought the law before the multitude of men
and women and all those that could understand in the first day of the
seventh month
and he read it plainly in the street that was before the water
gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and
all those that could understand and the ears of all the people were
attentive to the book
and esdras the scribe stood upon a step of wood which he had made
to speak upon and there stood by him mathathias and semeia and ania
and uria and helcia and maasia on his right hand and on the left
and esdras opened the book before all the people for he was above
all the people and when he had opened it all the people stood
and esdras blessed the lord the great god and all the people
answered amen amen lifting up their hands and they bowed down and
adored god with their faces to the ground
now josue and bani and serebia jamin accub sephtai odia
silence among the people to hear the law and the people stood in their
place
and they read in the book of the law of god distinctly and plainly
to be understood and they understood when it was read
and nehemias he is athersatha and esdras the priest and scribe
and the levites who interpreted to all the people said this is a holy
day to the lord our god do not mourn nor weep for all the people
wept when they heard the words of the law
and he said to them go eat fat meats and drink sweet wine and
send portions to them that have not prepared for themselves because it
is the holy day of the lord and be not sad for the joy of the lord is
our strength
and the levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace
for the day is holy and be not sorrowful
so all the people went to eat and drink and to send portions and
to make great mirth because they understood the words that he had
taught them
and on the second day the chiefs of the families of all the
people the priests and the levites were gathered together to esdras
the scribe that he should interpret to them the words of the law
and they found written in the law that the lord had commanded by
the hand of moses that the children of israel should dwell in
tabernacles on the feast in the seventh month
and that they should proclaim and publish the word in all their
cities and in jerusalem saying go forth to the mount and fetch
branches of olive and branches of beautiful wood branches of myrtle
and branches of palm and branches of thick trees to make tabernacles
as it is written
and the people went forth and brought and they made themselves
tabernacles every man on the top of his house and in their courts and
in the courts of the house of god and in the street of the water gate
and in the street of the gate of ephraim
and all the assembly of them that were returned from the
captivity made tabernacles and dwelt in tabernacles for since the
days of josue the son of nun the children of israel had not done so
until that day and there was exceeding great joy
and he read in the book of the law of god day by day from the
first day till the last and they kept the solemnity seven days and in
the eighth day a solemn assembly according to the manner
benefits and the peoples ingratitude they pray for them and make a
covenant with god
and in the four and twentieth day of the month the children of
them
and the seed of the children of israel separated themselves from
every stranger and they stood and confessed their sins and the
iniquities of their fathers
and they rose up to stand and they read in the book of the law of
the lord their god four times in the day and four times they
confessed and adored the lord their god
and there stood up upon the step of the levites josue and bani
and cedmihel sabania bonni sarebias bani and chanani and they
cried with a loud voice to the lord their god
and the levites josue and cedmihel bonni hasebnia serebia
eternity to eternity and blessed be the high name of thy glory with all
blessing and praise
thou thyself o lord alone thou hast made heaven and the heaven
of heavens and all the host thereof the earth and all things that are
in it the seas and all that are therein and thou givest life to all
these things and the host of heaven adoreth thee
thou o lord god art he who chosest abram and broughtest him forth
out of the fire of the chaldeans and gavest him the name of abraham
which signifies fire or out of the fire of the tribulations and
temptations to which he was there exposedthe ancient rabbins
understood this literally affirming that abram was cast into the fire
by the idolaters and brought out by a miracle without any hurt
and thou didst find his heart faithful before thee and thou madest
a covenant with him to give him the land of the chanaanite of the
fulfilled thy words because thou art just
and thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in egypt and thou
didst hear their cry by the red sea
and thou shewedst signs and wonders upon pharao and upon all his
servants and upon the people of his land for thou knewest that they
dealt proudly against them and thou madest thyself a name as it is at
this day
and thou didst divide the sea before them and they passed through
the midst of the sea on dry land but their persecutors thou threwest
into the depth as a stone into mighty waters
and in a pillar of a cloud thou wast their leader by day and in a
pillar of fire by night that they might see the way by which they went
thou camest down also to mount sinai and didst speak with them
from heaven and thou gavest them right judgments and the law of truth
ceremonies and good precepts
thou madest known to them thy holy sabbath and didst prescribe to
them commandments and ceremonies and the law by the hand of moses thy
servant
and thou gavest them bread from heaven in their hunger and
broughtest forth water for them out of the rock in their thirst and
thou saidst to them that they should go in and possess the land upon
which thou hadst lifted up thy hand to give it them
but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks
and hearkened not to thy commandments
and they would not hear and they remembered not thy wonders which
thou hadst done for them and they hardened their necks and gave the
head to return to their bondage as it were by contention but thou a
forgiving god gracious and merciful longsuffering and full of
compassion didst not forsake them
return to egypt
yea when they had made also to themselves a molten calf and had
said this is thy god that brought thee out of egypt and had committed
great blasphemies
yet thou in thy many mercies didst not leave them in the desert
the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in
the way and the pillar of fire by night to shew them the way by which
they should go
and thou gavest them thy good spirit to teach them and thy manna
thou didst not withhold from their mouth and thou gavest them water for
their thirst
forty years didst thou feed them in the desert and nothing was
wanting to them their garments did not grow old and their feet were
not worn
and thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst divide lots
for them and they possessed the land of sehon and the land of the king
of hesebon and the land of og king of basan
and thou didst multiply their children as the stars of heaven and
broughtest them to the land concerning which thou hadst said to their
fathers that they should go in and possess it
and the children came and possessed the land and thou didst
humble before them the inhabitants of the land the chanaanites and
gavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of the
land that they might do with them as it pleased them
and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses
full of all goods cisterns made by others vineyards and oliveyards
and fruit trees in abundance and they ate and were filled and became
fat and abounded with delight in thy great goodness
but they provoked thee to wrath and departed from thee and threw
thy law behind their backs and they killed thy prophets who admonished
them earnestly to return to thee and they were guilty of great
blasphemies
and thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies and they
afflicted them and in the time of their tribulation they cried to thee
and thou heardest from heaven and according to the multitude of thy
tender mercies thou gavest them saviours to save them from the hands of
their enemies
but after they had rest they returned to do evil in thy sight
and thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies and they had
dominion over them then they returned and cried to thee and thou
heardest from heaven and deliveredst them many times in thy mercies
and thou didst admonish them to return to thy law but they dealt
proudly and hearkened not to thy commandments but sinned against thy
judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and they withdrew
the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear
and thou didst forbear with them for many years and didst testify
against them by thy spirit by the hand of thy prophets and they heard
not and thou didst deliver them into the hand of the people of the
lands
yet in thy very many mercies thou didst not utterly consume them
nor forsake them because thou art a merciful and gracious god
now therefore our god great strong and terrible who keepest
covenant and mercy turn not away from thy face all the labour which
hath come upon us upon our kings and our princes and our priests and
our prophets and our fathers and all the people from the days of the
king of assur until this day
and thou art just in all things that have come upon us because
thou hast done truth but we have done wickedly
our kings our princes our priests and our fathers have not kept
thy law and have not minded thy commandments and thy testimonies which
thou hast testified among them
and they have not served thee in their kingdoms and in thy
manifold goodness which thou gavest them and in the large and fat
land which thou deliveredst before them nor did they return from their
most wicked devices
behold we ourselves this day are bondmen and the land which thou
gavest our fathers to eat the bread thereof and the good things
thereof and we ourselves are servants in it
and the fruits thereof grow up for the kings whom thou hast set
over us for our sins and they have dominion over our bodies and over
our beasts according to their will and we are in great tribulation
and because of all this we ourselves make a covenant and write
it and our princes our levites and our priests sign it

wait equally in order
mathania and becbecia obedia and mosollam telmon accub were
keepers of the gates and of the entrances before the gates
these were in the days of joacim the son of josue the son of
priest and scribe
and at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they sought the
the dedication and to rejoice with thanksgiving and with singing and
with cymbals and psalteries and harps
and the sons of the singing men were gathered together out of the
plain country about jerusalem and out of the villages of nethuphati
and from the house of galgal and from the countries of geba and
and the priests and the levites were purified and they purified
the people and the gates and the wall
and i made the princes of juda go up upon the wall and i
appointed two great choirs to give praise and they went on the right
hand upon the wall toward the dung gate
and after them went osaias and half of the princes of juda
and azarias esdras and mosollam judas and benjamin and
and of the sons of the priests with trumpets zacharias the son
of jonathan the son of semeia the son of mathania the son of michaia
the son of zechur the son of asaph
and his brethren semeia and azareel malalai galalai maai
the man of god and esdras the scribe before them at the fountain gate
and they went up over against them by the stairs of the city of
water gate eastward
and the second choir of them that gave thanks went on the
opposite side and i after them and the half of the people upon the
wall and upon the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall
and above the gate of ephraim and above the old gate and above
the fish gate and the tower of hananeel and the tower of emath and
even to the flock gate and they stood still in the watch gate
and the two choirs of them that gave praise stood still at the
house of god and i and the half of the magistrates with me
and the priests eliachim maasia miamin michea elioenai
and maasia and semeia and eleazar and azzi and johanan and
their overseer
and they sacrificed on that day great sacrifices and they
rejoiced for god had made them joyful with great joy their wives also
and their children rejoiced and the joy of jerusalem was heard afar
off
they appointed also in that day men over the storehouses of the
treasure for the libations and for the firstfruits and for the
tithes that the rulers of the city might bring them in by them in
honour of thanksgiving for the priests and levites for juda was joyful
in the priests and levites that assisted
and they kept the watch of their god and the observance of
expiation and the singing men and the porters according to the
commandment of david and of solomon his son
for in the days of david and asaph from the beginning there were
chief singers appointed to praise with canticles and give thanks to
and all israel in the days of zorobabel and in the days of
day and they sanctified the levites and the levites sanctified the
sons of aaron
aside and sanctified for their use
and on that day they read in the book of moses in the hearing of
the people and therein was found written that the ammonites and the
because they met not the children of israel with bread and water
and they hired against them balaam to curse them and our god turned
the curse into blessing
and it came to pass when they had heard the law that they
separated every stranger from israel
and over this thing was eliasib the priest who was set over the
treasury of the house of our god and was near akin to tobias
kind
and he made him a great storeroom where before him they laid up
gifts and frankincense and vessels and the tithes of the corn of the
wine and of the oil the portions of the levites and of the singing
men and of the porters and the firstfruits of the priests
but in all this time i was not in jerusalem because in the two
and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon i went to the king
and after certain days i asked the king
and i came to jerusalem and i understood the evil that eliasib
had done for tobias to make him a storehouse in the courts of the house
of god
and it seemed to me exceeding evil and i cast forth the vessels
of the house of tobias out of the storehouse
and i commanded and they cleansed again the vessels of the house
of god the sacrifice and the frankincense
and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been
given them and that the levites and the singing men and they that
ministered were fled away every man to his own country
and i pleaded the matter against the magistrates and said why
have we forsaken the house of god and i gathered them together and i
made them to stand in their places
and all juda brought the tithe of the corn and the wine and the
oil into the storehouses
and we set over the storehouses selemias the priest and sadoc
the scribe and of the levites phadaia and next to them hanan the son
of zachur the son of mathania for they were approved as faithful and
to them were committed the portions of their brethren
remember me o my god for this thing and wipe not out my
kindnesses which i have done relating to the house of my god and his
ceremonies
in those days i saw in juda some treading the presses on the
sabbath and carrying sheaves and lading asses with wine and grapes
and figs and all manner of burthens and bringing them into jerusalem
on the sabbath day and i charged them that they should sell on a day on
which it was lawful to sell
some tyrians also dwelt there who brought fish and all manner
of wares and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children of juda in
and i rebuked the chief men of juda and said to them what is
this evil thing that you are doing profaning the sabbath day
did not our fathers do these things and our god brought all this
evil upon us and upon this city and you bring more wrath upon israel
by violating the sabbath
and it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem were at
rest on the sabbath day i spoke and they shut the gates and i
commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath and i
set some of my servants at the gates that none should bring in burthens
on the sabbath day
so the merchants and they that sold all kinds of wares stayed
without jerusalem once or twice
and i charged them and i said to them why stay you before the
wall if you do so another time i will lay hands on you and from that
time they came no more on the sabbath
i spoke also to the levites that they should be purified and
should come to keep the gates and to sanctify the sabbath day for this
also remember me o my god and spare me according to the multitude of
thy tender mercies
in those days also i saw jews that married wives women of
and their children spoke half in the speech of azotus and could
not speak the jews language but they spoke according to the language
of this and that people
and i chid them and laid my curse upon them and i beat some of
them and shaved off their hair and made them swear by god that they
would not give their daughters to their sons nor take their daughters
for their sons nor for themselves saying
did not solomon king of israel sin in this kind of thing and
surely among many nations there was not a king like him and he was
beloved of his god and god made him king over all israel and yet women
of other countries brought even him to sin
and shall we also be disobedient and do all this great evil to
transgress against our god and marry strange women
and one of the sons of joiada the son of eliasib the high priest
was soninlaw to sanaballat the horonite and i drove him from me
remember them o lord my god that defile the priesthood and the
law of priests and levites
so i separated from them all strangers and i appointed the
courses of the priests and the levites every man in his ministry
and for the offering of wood at times appointed and for the
firstfruits remember me o my god unto good amen
virtues are herein recorded it contains most excellent documents of
great piety extraordinary patience and of a perfect resignation to the
will of god his humble prayer was heard and the angel raphael was sent
to relieve him he is thankful and praises the lord calling on the
children of israel to do the same having lived to the age of one
hundred and two years he exhorts his son and grandsons to piety
foretells the destruction of ninive and the rebuilding of jerusalem he
dies happily
