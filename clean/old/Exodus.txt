king who commandeth all their male children to be killed
these are the names of the children of israel that went into egypt
with jacob they went in every man with his household
ruben simeon levi juda
issachar zabulon and benjamin
dan and nephthali gad and aser
and all the souls that came out of jacobs thigh were seventy but
after he was dead and all his brethren and all that generation
the children of israel increased and sprung up into multitudes
and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land
in the mean time there arose a new king over egypt that knew not
and he said to his people behold the people of the children of
come let us wisely oppress them lest they multiply and if any
war shall rise against us join with our enemies and having overcome
us depart out of the land
therefore he set over them masters of the works to afflict them
with burdens and they built for pharao cities of tabernacles phithom
and ramesses
but the more they oppressed them the more they were multiplied
and increased
and the egyptians hated the children of israel and afflicted them
and mocked them
and they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and brick
and with all manner of service wherewith they were overcharged in the
works of the earth
and the king of egypt spoke to the midwives of the hebrews of
whom one was called sephora the other phua
commanding them when you shall do the office of midwives to the
kill it if a woman keep it alive
but the midwives feared god and did not do as the king of egypt
had commanded but saved the men children
and the king called for them and said what is it that you meant
to do that you would save the men children
they answered the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for
they themselves are skilful in the office of a midwife and they are
delivered before we come to them
therefore god dealt well with the midwives and the people
multiplied and grew exceedingly strong
and because the midwives feared god he built them houses
for their lie which was a venial sin but for their fear of god and
their humanity but this reward was only temporal in building them
houses that is in establishing and enriching their families
pharao therefore charged all his people saying whatsoever shall
be born of the male sex ye shall cast into the river whatsoever of the
female ye shall save alive
by the daughter of pharao and adopted for her son he killeth an
after this there went a man of the house of levi and took a wife
of his own kindred
and she conceived and bore a son and seeing him a goodly child
hid him three months
and when she could hide him no longer she took a basket made of
bulrushes and daubed it with slime and pitch and put the little babe
therein and laid him in the sedges by the rivers brink
his sister standing afar off and taking notice what would be done
and behold the daughter of pharao came down to wash herself in the
river and her maids walked by the rivers brink and when she saw the
basket in the sedges she sent one of her maids for it and when it was
brought
she opened it and seeing within it an infant crying having
compassion on it she said this is one of the babes of the hebrews
and the childs sister said to her shall i go and call to thee a
she answered go the maid went and called her mother
and pharaos daughter said to her take this child and nurse him
for me i will give thee thy wages the woman took and nursed the
child and when he was grown up she delivered him to pharaos daughter
and she adopted him for a son and called him moses saying
out of the water
in those days after moses was grown up he went out to his
brethren and saw their affliction and an egyptian striking one of the
and when he had looked about this way and that way and saw no one
there he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand
as a prelude to his delivering the people from their oppression and
bondage he thought says st stephen acts that his brethren
understood that god by his hand would save them but such particular and
extraordinary examples are not to be imitated
and going out the next day he saw two hebrews quarrelling and he
said to him that did the wrong why strikest thou thy neighbour
but he answered who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us
wilt thou kill me as thou didst yesterday kill the egyptian moses
feared and said how is this come to be known
and pharao heard of this word and sought to kill moses but he
fled from his sight and abode in the land of madian and he sat down by
a well
the son of abraham by cetura and was peopled by his posterity
and the priest of madian had seven daughters who came to draw
water and when the troughs were filled desired to water their fathers
flocks
and the shepherds came and drove them away and moses arose and
defending the maids watered their sheep
and when they returned to raguel their father he said to them
the first verse of the following chapter
they answered a man of egypt delivered us from the hands of the
shepherds and he drew water also with us and gave the sheep to drink
but he said where is he why have you let the man go call him
that he may eat bread
and moses swore that he would dwell with him and he took sephora
his daughter to wife
and she bore him a son whom he called gersam saying i have been
a stranger in a foreign country and she bore another whom he called
out of the hand of pharao
signifies the help of god
now after a long time the king of egypt died and the children of
unto god from the works
and he heard their groaning and remembered the covenant which he
made with abraham isaac and jacob
and the lord looked upon the children of israel and he knew them
upon them
now moses fed the sheep of jethro his fatherinlaw the priest of
came to the mountain of god horeb
and the lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of
a bush and he saw that the bush was on fire and was not burnt
his name
and moses said i will go and see this great sight why the bush
is not burnt
and when the lord saw that he went forward to see he called to him
out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he answered
and he said come not nigh hither put off the shoes from thy feet
for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground
and he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the
not look at god
and the lord said to him i have seen the affliction of my people
in egypt and i have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that
are over the works
and knowing their sorrow i am come down to deliver them out of the
hands of the egyptians and to bring them out of that land into a good
and spacious land into a land that floweth with milk and honey to the
places of the chanaanite and hethite and amorrhite and pherezite and
for the cry of the children of israel is come unto me and i have
seen their affliction wherewith they are oppressed by the egyptians
but come and i will send thee to pharao that thou mayst bring
forth my people the children of israel out of egypt
and moses said to god who am i that i should go to pharao and
should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt
and he said to him i will be with thee and this thou shalt have
for a sign that i have sent thee when thou shalt have brought my people
out of egypt thou shalt offer sacrifice to god upon this mountain
moses said to god lo i shall go to the children of israel and
say to them the god of your fathers hath sent me to you if they shall
say to me what is his name what shall i say to them
god said to moses i am who am he said thus shalt thou say to
the children of israel he who is hath sent me to you
independent infinite without beginning end or change and the source
of all other beings
and god said again to moses thus shalt thou say to the children
of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of
ever and this is my memorial unto all generations
go and gather together the ancients of israel and thou shalt say
to them the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of
have visited you and i have seen all that hath befallen you in egypt
and i have said the word to bring you forth out of the affliction
of egypt into the land of the chanaanite and hethite and amorrhite
and pherezite and hevite and jebusite to a land that floweth with
milk and honey
and they shall hear thy voice and thou shalt go in thou and the
ancients of israel to the king of egypt and thou shalt say to him the
into the wilderness to sacrifice unto the lord our god
but i know that the king of egypt will not let you go but by a
mighty hand
for i will stretch forth my hand and will strike egypt with all
my wonders which i will do in the midst of them after these he will let
you go
and i will give favour to this people in the sight of the
but every woman shall ask of her neighbour and of her that is in
her house vessels of silver and of gold and raiment and you shall put
them on your sons and daughters and shall spoil egypt
the egyptians this was not authorizing theft or injustice but was a
just disposal made by him who is the great lord and master of all
things in order to pay the children of israel some part of what was due
to them from the egyptians for their labours
moses answered and said they will not believe me nor hear my
voice but they will say the lord hath not appeared to thee
then he said to him what is that thou holdest in thy hand he
answered a rod
and the lord said cast it down upon the ground he cast it down
and it was turned into a serpent so that moses fled from it
and the lord said put out thy hand and take it by the tail he
put forth his hand and took hold of it and it was turned into a rod
that they may believe saith he that the lord god of their
fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
hath appeared to thee
and the lord said again put thy hand into thy bosom and when he
had put it into his bosom he brought it forth leprous as snow
and he said put back thy hand into thy bosom he put it back and
brought it out again and it was like the other flesh
if they will not believe thee saith he nor hear the voice of the
former sign they will believe the word of the latter sign
but if they will not even believe these two signs nor hear thy
voice take of the river water and pour it out upon the dry land and
whatsoever thou drawest out of the river shall be turned into blood
moses said i beseech thee lord i am not eloquent from yesterday
and the day before and since thou hast spoken to thy servant i have
more impediment and slowness of tongue
the lord said to him who made mans mouth or who made the dumb
and the deaf the seeing and the blind did not i
go therefore and i will be in thy mouth and i will teach thee
what thou shalt speak
but he said i beseech thee lord send whom thou wilt send
the lord being angry at moses said aaron the levite is thy
brother i know that he is eloquent behold he cometh forth to meet
thee and seeing thee shall be glad at heart
speak to him and put my words in his mouth and i will be in thy
mouth and in his month and will shew you what you must do
he shall speak in thy stead to the people and shall be thy mouth
but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to god
and take this rod in thy hand wherewith thou shalt do the signs
moses went his way and returned to jethro his fatherinlaw and
said to him i will go and return to my brethren into egypt that i may
see if they be yet alive and jethro said to him go in peace
and the lord said to moses in madian go and return into egypt
for they are all dead that sought thy life
moses therefore took his wife and his sons and set them upon an
ass and returned into egypt carrying the rod of god in his hand
and the lord said to him as he was returning into egypt see that
thou do all the wonders before pharao which i have put in thy hand i
shall harden his heart and he will not let the people go
by withdrawing from him for his just punishment the dew of grace that
might have softened his heart and so suffering him to grow harder and
harder
and thou shalt say to him thus saith the lord israel is my son
my firstborn
i have said to thee let my son go that he may serve me and thou
wouldst not let him go behold i will kill thy son thy firstborn
and when he was in his journey in the inn the lord met him and
would have killed him
representing the lord who treated moses in this manner for having
neglected the circumcision of his younger son which his wife
understanding circumcised her child upon the spot upon which the angel
let moses go
immediately sephora took a very sharp stone and circumcised the
foreskin of her son and touched his feet and said a bloody spouse art
thou to me
and he let him go after she had said a bloody spouse art thou to
me because of the circumcision
and the lord said to aaron go into the desert to meet moses and
he went forth to meet him in the mountain of god and kissed him
and moses told aaron all the words of the lord by which he had
sent him and the signs that he had commanded
and they came together and they assembled all the ancients of the
children of israel
and aaron spoke all the words which the lord had said to moses
and he wrought the signs before the people
and the people believed and they heard that the lord had visited
the children of israel and that he had looked upon their affliction
and falling down they adored
after these things moses and aaron went in and said to pharao
sacrifice to me in the desert
but he answered who is the lord that i should hear his voice and
let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go
and they said the god of the hebrews hath called us to go three
days journey into the wilderness and to sacrifice to the lord our god
lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us
the king of egypt said to them why do you moses and aaron draw off
the people from their works get you gone to your burdens
and pharao said the people of the land are numerous you see that
the multitude is increased how much more if you give them rest from
their works
therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works and
the taskmasters of the people saying
you shall give straw no more to the people to make brick as
before but let them go and gather straw
and you shall lay upon them the task of bricks which they did
before neither shall you diminish any thing thereof for they are idle
and therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god
let them be oppressed with works and let them fulfil them that
they may not regard lying words
and the overseers of the works and the taskmasters went out and
said to the people thus saith pharao i allow you no straw
go and gather it where you can find it neither shall any thing
of your work be diminished
and the people was scattered through all the land of egypt to
gather straw
and the overseers of the works pressed them saying fulfil your
work every day as before ye were wont to do when straw was given you
and they that were over the works of the children of israel were
scourged by pharaos taskmasters saying why have you not made up the
task of bricks both yesterday and to day as before
and the officers of the children of israel came and cried out to
straw is not given us and bricks are required of us as before
behold we thy servants are beaten with whips and thy people is
unjustly dealt withal
and he said you are idle and therefore you say let us go and
sacrifice to the lord
go therefore and work straw shall not be given you and you shall
deliver the accustomed number of bricks
and the officers of the children of israel saw that they were in
evil case because it was said to them there shall not a whit be
diminished of the bricks for every day
and they met moses and aaron who stood over against them as they
came out from pharao
and they said to them the lord see and judge because you have
made our savour to stink before pharao and his servants and you have
given him a sword to kill us
and moses returned to the lord and said lord why hast thou
afflicted this people wherefore hast thou sent me
for since the time that i went in to pharao to speak in thy name
he hath afflicted thy people and thou hast not delivered them
to moses and aaron
and the lord said to moses now thou shalt see what i will do to
hand shall he cast them out of his land
and the lord spoke to moses saying i am the lord
that appeared to abraham to isaac and to jacob by the name of
proper name of god which signifieth his eternal selfexistent being
of it whenever it occurs in the bible they read adonai which
signifies the lord and therefore they put the points or vowels which
belong to the name adonai to the four letters of that other ineffable
name jod he vau he hence some moderns have framed the name jehovah
unknown to all the ancients whether jews or christians for the true
pronunciation of the name which is in the hebrew text by long disuse
is now quite lost
and i made a covenant with them to give them the land of chanaan
the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers
i have heard the groaning of the children of israel wherewith the
therefore say to the children of israel i am the lord who will
bring you out from the workprison of the egyptians and will deliver
you from bondage and redeem you with a high arm and great judgments
and i will take you to myself for my people i will be your god
and you shall know that i am the lord your god who brought you out from
the workprison of the egyptians
and brought you into the land concerning which i lifted up my hand
to give it to abraham isaac and jacob and i will give it you to
possess i am the lord
and moses told all this to the children of israel but they did not
hearken to him for anguish of spirit and most painful work
and the lord spoke to moses saying
go in and speak to pharao king of egypt that he let the children
of israel go out of his land
moses answered before the lord behold the children of israel do
not hearken to me and how will pharao hear me especially as i am of
uncircumcised lips
utterance
and the lord spoke to moses and aaron and he gave them a charge
unto the children of israel and unto pharao the king of egypt that
they should bring forth the children of israel out of the land of egypt
these are the heads of their houses by their families the sons of
these are the kindreds of ruben the sons of simeon jamuel and
and these are the names of the sons of levi by their kindreds
hundred and thirtyseven
the sons of gerson lobni and semei by their kindreds
the sons of caath amram and isaar and hebron and oziel and the
years of caaths life were a hundred and thirtythree
the sons of merari moholi and musi these are the kindreds of
and amram took to wife jochabed his aunt by the fathers side and
she bore him aaron and moses and the years of amrams life were a
hundred and thirtyseven
the sons also of isaar core and nepheg and zechri
the sons also of oziel mizael and elizaphan and sethri
and aaron took to wife elizabeth the daughter of aminadab sister
of nahason who bore him nadab and abiu and eleazar and ithamar
the sons also of core aser and elcana and abiasaph these are
the kindreds of the corites
but eleazar the son of aaron took a wife of the daughters of
families by their kindreds
these are aaron and moses whom the lord commanded to bring forth
the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their companies
these are they that speak to pharao king of egypt in order to
bring out the children of israel from egypt these are that moses and
in the day when the lord spoke to moses in the land of egypt
and the lord spoke to moses saying i am the lord speak thou to
and moses said before the lord lo i am of uncircumcised lips how
will pharao hear me
the waters of egypt into blood which was the first plague the
magicians do the like and pharaos heart is hardened
and the lord said to moses behold i have appointed thee the god
of pharao and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet
power as gods instrument over him and his people
thou shalt speak to him all that i command thee and he shall speak
to pharao that he let the children of israel go out of his land
but i shall harden his heart and shall multiply my signs and
wonders in the land of egypt
of heart but by permitting it and by withdrawing grace from him in
punishment of his malice which alone was the proper cause of his being
hardened
and he will not hear you and i will lay my hand upon egypt and
will bring forth my army and my people the children of israel out of
the land of egypt by very great judgments
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord who have stretched
forth my hand upon egypt and have brought forth the children of israel
out of the midst of them
and moses and aaron did as the lord had commanded so did they
and moses was eighty years old and aaron eightythree when they
spoke to pharao
and the lord said to moses and aaron
when pharao shall say to you shew signs thou shalt say to aaron
into a serpent
so moses and aaron went in unto pharao and did as the lord had
commanded and aaron took the rod before pharao and his servants and it
was turned into a serpent
and pharao called the wise men and the magicians and they also by
and they every one cast down their rods and they were turned into
serpents but aarons rod devoured their rods
and pharaos heart was hardened and he did not hearken to them
as the lord had commanded
and the lord said to moses pharaos heart is hardened he will
not let the people go
go to him in the morning behold he will go out to the waters and
thou shalt stand to meet him on the bank of the river and thou shalt
take in thy hand the rod that was turned into a serpent
and thou shalt say to him the lord god of the hebrews sent me to
thee saying let my people go to sacrifice to me in the desert and
hitherto thou wouldst not hear
thus therefore saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am
the lord behold i will strike with the rod that is in my hand the
water of the river and it shall be turned into blood
and the fishes that are in the river shall die and the waters
shall be corrupted and the egyptians shall be afflicted when they drink
the water of the river
the lord also said to moses say to aaron take thy rod and
stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of egypt and upon their rivers
and streams and pools and all the ponds of waters that they may be
turned into blood and let blood be in all the land of egypt both in
vessels of wood and of stone
and moses and aaron did as the lord had commanded and lifting up
the rod he struck the water of the river before pharao and his
servants and it was turned into blood
and the fishes that were in the river died and the river
corrupted and the egyptians could not drink the water of the river and
there was blood in all the land of egypt
and the magicians of the egyptians with their enchantments did in
like manner and pharaos heart was hardened neither did he hear them
as the lord had commanded
and he turned himself away and went into his house neither did
he set his heart to it this time also
and all the egyptians dug round about the river for water to
drink for they could not drink of the water of the river
and seven days were fully ended after that the lord struck the
river
go but breaketh his promise the third plague is of sciniphs the
fourth is of flies pharao again promiseth to dismiss the people but
doth it not
and the lord said to moses go in to pharao and thou shalt say to
him thus saith the lord let my people go to sacrifice to me
but if thou wilt not let them go behold i will strike all thy
coasts with frogs
and the river shall bring forth an abundance of frogs which shall
come up and enter into thy house and thy bedchamber and upon thy bed
and into the houses of thy servants and to thy people and into thy
ovens and into the remains of thy meats
and the frogs shall come in to thee and to thy people and to all
thy servants
and the lord said to moses say to aaron stretch forth thy hand
upon the streams and upon the rivers and the pools and bring forth
frogs upon the land of egypt
and aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of egypt and
the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt
and the magicians also by their enchantments did in like manner
and they brought forth frogs upon the land of egypt
but pharao called moses and aaron and said to them pray ye to the
the people go to sacrifice to the lord
magicians by the help of the devil could bring frogs yet they could
not take them away god being pleased to abridge in this the power of
and in this restraint of the power of the devil were forced to
acknowledge the finger of god
and moses said to pharao set me a time when i shall pray for thee
and for thy servants and for thy people that the frogs may be driven
away from thee and from thy house and from thy servants and from thy
people and may remain only in the river
and he answered to morrow but he said i will do according to
thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like to the lord our
and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy house and from
thy servants and from thy people and shall remain only in the river
and moses and aaron went forth from pharao and moses cried to the
and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs
died out of the houses and out of the villages and out of the fields
and they gathered them together into immense heaps and the land
was corrupted
and pharao seeing that rest was given hardened his own heart and
did not hear them as the lord had commanded
the efficient cause of his heart being hardened and not godsee the
same repeated in ver pharao hardened his heart at this time also
likewise chap and chap
and the lord said to moses say to aaron stretch forth thy rod
and strike the dust of the earth and may there be sciniphs in all the
land of egypt
troublesome both to men and beast
and they did so and aaron stretched forth his hand holding the
rod and he struck the dust of the earth and there came sciniphs on men
and on beasts all the dust of the earth was turned into sciniphs
through all the land of egypt
and the magicians with their enchantments practised in like
manner to bring forth sciniphs and they could not and there were
sciniphs as well on men as on beasts
and the magicians said to pharao this is the finger of god and
had commanded
the lord also said to moses arise early and stand before pharao
for he will go forth to the waters and thou shalt say to him thus
saith the lord let my people go to sacrifice to me
but if thou wilt not let them go behold i will send in upon thee
and upon thy servants and upon thy houses all kind of flies and the
houses of the egyptians shall be filled with flies of divers kinds and
the whole land wherein they shall be
and i will make the land of gessen wonderful in that day so that
flies shall not be there and thou shalt know that i am the lord in the
midst of the earth
and i will put a division between my people and thy people to
morrow shall this sign be
and the lord did so and there came a very grievous swarm of flies
into the houses of pharao and of his servants and into all the land of
and pharao called moses and aaron and said to them go and
sacrifice to your god in this land
and moses said it cannot be so for we shall sacrifice the
abominations of the egyptians to the lord our god now if we kill those
things which the egyptians worship in their presence they will stone
us
oxen rams etc it is the usual style of the scriptures to call all
idols and false gods abominations to signify how much the people of
we will go three days journey into the wilderness and we will
sacrifice to the lord our god as he hath commanded us
and pharao said i will let you go to sacrifice to the lord your
and moses said i will go out from thee and will pray to the
from his people to morrow but do not deceive any more in not letting
the people go to sacrifice to the lord
so moses went out from pharao and prayed to the lord
and he did according to his word and he took away the flies from
so much as one
and pharaos heart was hardened so that neither this time would
he let the people go
men and beasts the seventh of hail pharao promiseth again to let the
people go and breaketh his word
and the lord said to moses go in to pharao and speak to him thus
saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go to sacrifice to me
but if thou refuse and withhold them still
behold my hand shall be upon thy fields and a very grievous
murrain upon thy horses and asses and camels and oxen and sheep
and the lord will make a wonderful difference between the
possessions of israel and the possessions of the egyptians that nothing
at all shall die of those things that belong to the children of israel
and the lord appointed a time saying to morrow will the lord do
this thing in the land
the lord therefore did this thing the next day and all the beasts
of the egyptians died but of the beasts of the children of israel there
died not one
and pharao sent to see and there was not any thing dead of that
which israel possessed and pharaos heart was hardened and he did not
let the people go
and the lord said to moses and aaron take to you handfuls of ashes
out of the chimney and let moses sprinkle it in the air in the presence
of pharao
and be there dust upon all the land of egypt for there shall be
boils and swelling blains both in men and beasts in the whole land of
and they took ashes out of the chimney and stood before pharao
and moses sprinkled it in the air and there came boils with swelling
blains in men and beasts
neither could the magicians stand before moses for the boils that
were upon them and in all the land of egypt
and the lord hardened pharaos heart and he hearkened not unto
them as the lord had spoken to moses
chap
and the lord said to moses arise in the morning and stand before
for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart and
upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayst know that there
is none like me in all the earth
for now i will stretch out my hand to strike thee and thy people
with pestilence and thou shalt perish from the earth
and therefore have i raised thee that i may shew my power in
thee and my name may be spoken of throughout all the earth
dost thou yet hold back my people and wilt thou not let them go
behold i will cause it to rain to morrow at this same hour an
exceeding great hail such as hath not been in egypt from the day that
it was founded until this present time
send therefore now presently and gather together thy cattle and
all that thou hast in the field for men and beasts and all things that
shall be found abroad and not gathered together out of the fields which
the hail shall fall upon shall die
he that feared the word of the lord among pharaos servants made
his servants and his cattle flee into houses
but he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants
and his cattle in the fields
and the lord said to moses stretch forth thy hand towards heaven
that there may be hail in the whole land of egypt upon men and upon
beasts and upon every herb of the field in the land of egypt
and moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven and the lord
sent thunder and hail and lightnings running along the ground and the
and the hail and fire mixt with it drove on together and it was
of so great bigness as never before was seen in the whole land of egypt
since that nation was founded
and the hail destroyed through all the land of egypt all things
that were in the fields both man and beast and the hail smote every
herb of the field and it broke every tree of the country
only in the land of gessen where the children of israel were the
hail fell not
and pharao sent and called moses and aaron saying to them i have
sinned this time also the lord is just i and my people are wicked
pray ye to the lord that the thunderings of god and the hail may
cease that i may let you go and that ye may stay here no longer
moses said as soon as i am gone out of the city i will stretch
forth my hands to the lord and the thunders shall cease and the hail
shall be no more that thou mayst know that the earth is the lords
but i know that neither thou nor thy servants do yet fear the
the flax therefore and the barley were hurt because the barley
was green and the flax was now bolled
but the wheat and other winter corn were not hurt because they
were lateward
and when moses was gone from pharao out of the city he stretched
forth his hands to the lord and the thunders and the hail ceased
neither did there drop any more rain upon the earth
and pharao seeing that the rain and the hail and the thunders
were ceased increased his sin
and his heart was hardened and the heart of his servants and it
was made exceeding hard neither did he let the children of israel go
as the lord had commanded by the hand of moses
still hardened
and the lord said to moses go in to pharao for i have hardened
his heart and the heart of his servants that i may work these my signs
in him
and thou mayst tell in the ears of thy sons and of thy grandsons
how often i have plagued the egyptians and wrought my signs amongst
them and you may know that i am the lord
therefore moses and aaron went in to pharao and said to him thus
saith the lord god of the hebrews how long refusest thou to submit to
me let my people go to sacrifice to me
but if thou resist and wilt not let them go behold i will bring
in tomorrow the locusts into thy coasts
to cover the face of the earth that nothing thereof may appear
but that which the hail hath left may be eaten for they shall feed upon
all the trees that spring in the fields
and they shall fill thy houses and the houses of thy servants
and of all the egyptians such a number as thy fathers have not seen
nor thy grandfathers from the time they were first upon the earth
until this present day and he turned himself away and went forth from
and pharaos servants said to him how long shall we endure this
scandal iet the men go to sacrifice to the lord their god dost thou
not see that egypt is undone
and they called back moses and aaron to pharao and he said to
them go sacrifice to the lord your god who are they that shall go
moses said we will go with our young and old with our sons and
daughters with our sheep and herds for it is the solemnity of the lord
our god
and pharao answered so be the lord with you as i shall let you
and your children go who can doubt but that you intend some great evil
it shall not be so but go ye men only and sacrifice to the
out from pharaos presence
and the lord said to moses stretch forth thy hand upon the land
of egypt unto the locust that it come upon it and devour every herb
that is left after the hail
and moses stretched forth his rod upon the land of egypt and the
morning the burning wind raised the locusts
and they came up over the whole land of egypt and rested in all
the coasts of the egyptians innumerable the like as had not been
before that time nor shall be hereafter
and they covered the whole face of the earth wasting all things
the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any thing
that was green on the trees or in the herbs of the earth in all egypt
wherefore pharao in haste called moses and aaron and said to
them i have sinned against the lord your god and against you
but now forgive me my sin this time also and pray to the lord
your god that he take away from me this death
and moses going forth from the presence of pharao prayed to the
and he made a very strong wind to blow from the west and it took
the locusts and cast them into the red sea there remained not so much
as one in all the coasts of egypt
and the lord hardened pharaos heart neither did he let the
children of israel go
and the lord said to moses stretch out thy hand towards heaven
and may there be darkness upon the land of egypt so thick that it may be
felt
means of the gross exhalations which were to cause and accompany the
darkness
and moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven and there came
horrible darkness in all the land of egypt for three days
no man saw his brother nor moved himself out of the place where
he was but wheresoever the children of israel dwelt there was light
and pharao called moses and aaron and said to them go
sacrifice to the lord let your sheep only and herds remain let your
children go with you
moses said thou shalt give us also sacrifices and burnt
offerings to the lord our god
all the flocks shall go with us there shall not a hoof remain of
them for they are necessary for the service of the lord our god
especially as we know not what must be offered till we come to the very
place
and the lord hardened pharaos heart and he would not let them
go
and pharao said to moses get thee from me and beware thou see
not my face any more in what day soever thou shalt come in my sight
thou shalt die
moses answered so shall it be as thou hast spoken i will not
see thy face anymore
and the lord said to moses yet one plague more will i bring upon
out
therefore thou shalt tell all the people that every man ask of
his friend and every woman of her neighbour vessels of silver and of
gold
and the lord will give favour to his people in the sight of the
sight of pharaos servants and of all the people
and he said thus saith the lord at midnight i will enter into
and every firstborn in the land of the egyptians shall die from
the firstborn of pharao who sitteth on his throne even to the firstborn
of the handmaid that is at the mill and all the firstborn of beasts
and there shall be a great cry in all the land of egypt such as
neither hath been before nor shall be hereafter
but with all the children of israel there shall not a dog make the
least noise from man even to beast that you may know how wonderful a
difference the lord maketh between the egyptians and israel
and all these thy servants shall come down to me and shall
worship me saying go forth thou and all the people that is under
thee after that we will go out
and he went out from pharao exceeding angry but the lord said to
of egypt
and moses and aaron did all the wonders that are written before
children of israel go out of his land
chap
and the lord said to moses and aaron in the land of egypt
this month shall be to you the beginning of months it shall be
the first in the months of the year
speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of israel and say
to them on the tenth day of this month let every man take a lamb by
their families and houses
but if the number be less than may suffice to eat the lamb he
shall take unto him his neighbour that joineth to his house according
to the number of souls which may be enough to eat the lamb
and it shall be a lamb without blemish a male of one year
according to which rite also you shall take a kid
and all the same rites and ceremonies were to be used with the one as
with the other
and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month and
the whole multitude of the children of israel shall sacrifice it in the
evening
and they shall take of the blood thereof and put it upon both the
side posts and on the upper door posts of the houses wherein they
shall eat it
and they shall eat the flesh that night roasted at the fire and
unleavened bread with wild lettuce
you shall not eat thereof any thing raw nor boiled in water but
only roasted at the fire you shall eat the head with the feet and
entrails thereof
neither shall there remain any thing of it until morning if
there be any thing left you shall burn it with fire
and thus you shall eat it you shall gird your reins and you
shall have shoes on your feet holding staves in your hands and you
shall eat in haste for it is the phase that is the passage of the
and i will pass through the land of egypt that night and will
kill every firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and
against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgments i am the lord
and the blood shall be unto you for a sign in the houses where
you shall be and i shall see the blood and shall pass over you and
the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i shall strike the
land of egypt
and this day shall be for a memorial to you and you shall keep
it a feast to the lord in your generations with an everlasting
observance
seven days shall you eat unleavened bread in the first day there
shall be no leaven in your houses whosoever shall eat any thing
leavened from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall
perish out of israel
the first day shall be holy and solemn and the seventh day shall
be kept with the like solemnity you shall do no work in them except
those things that belong to eating
and you shall observe the feast of the unleavened bread for in
this same day i will bring forth your army out of the land of egypt and
you shall keep this day in your generations by a perpetual observance
the first month the fourteenth day of the month in the evening
you shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the
same month in the evening
unleavened bread in the institution of the blessed sacrament which was
on the evening of the paschal solemnity at which time there was no
leavened bread to be found in israel
seven days there shall not be found any leaven in your houses he
that shall eat leavened bread his soul shall perish out of the assembly
of israel whether he be a stranger or born in the land
you shall not eat any thing leavened in all your habitations you
shall eat unleavened bread
and moses called all the ancients of the children of israel and
said to them go take a lamb by your families and sacrifice the phase
and dip a bunch of hyssop in the blood that is at the door and
sprinkle the transom of the door therewith and both the door cheeks
let none of you go out of the door of his house till morning
blood of the paschal lamb in order to their being delivered from the
sword of the destroying angel was a lively figure of our redemption by
the blood of christ
for the lord will pass through striking the egyptians and when
he shall see the blood on the transom and on both the posts he will
pass over the door of the house and not suffer the destroyer to come
into your houses and to hurt you
thou shalt keep this thing as a law for thee and thy children for
ever
and when you have entered into the land which the lord will give
you as he hath promised you shall observe these ceremonies
and when your children shall say to you what is the meaning of
this service
you shall say to them it is the victim of the passage of the
striking the egyptians and saving our houses and the people bowing
themselves adored
and the children of israel going forth did as the lord had
commanded moses and aaron
and it came to pass at midnight the lord slew every firstborn in
the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharao who sat on his throne
unto the firstborn of the captive woman that was in the prison and all
the firstborn of cattle
and pharao arose in the night and all his servants and all
wherein there lay not one dead
and pharao calling moses and aaron in the night said arise and
go forth from among my people you and the children of israel go
sacrifice to the lord as you say
your sheep and herds take along with you as you demanded and
departing bless me
and the egyptians pressed the people to go forth out of the land
speedily saying we shall all die
the people therefore took dough before it was leavened and tying
it in their cloaks put it on their shoulders
and the children of israel did as moses had commanded and they
asked of the egyptians vessels of silver and gold and very much
raiment
and the lord gave favour to the people in the sight of the
and the children of israel set forward from ramesse to socoth
being about six hundred thousand men on foot beside children
and a mixed multitude without number went up also with them
sheep and herds and beasts of divers kinds exceeding many
and they baked the meal which a little before they had brought
out of egypt in dough and they made hearth cakes unleavened for it
could not be leavened the egyptians pressing them to depart and not
suffering them to make any stay neither did they think of preparing any
meat
and the abode of the children of israel that they made in egypt
was four hundred and thirty years
which being expired the same day all the army of the lord went
forth out of the land of egypt
this is the observable night of the lord when he brought them
forth out of the land of egypt this night all the children of israel
must observe in their generations
and the lord said to moses and aaron this is the service of the
but every bought servant shall be circumcised and so shall eat
the stranger and the hireling shall not eat thereof
in one house shall it be eaten neither shall you carry forth of
the flesh thereof out of the house neither shall you break a bone
thereof
all the assembly of the children of israel shall keep it
and if any stranger be willing to dwell among you and to keep
the phase of the lord all his males shall first be circumcised and
then shall he celebrate it according to the manner and he shall be as
he that is born in the land but if any man be uncircumcised he shall
not eat thereof
the same law shall be to him that is born in the land and to the
proselyte that sojourneth with you
and all the children of israel did as the lord had commanded
and the same day the lord brought forth the children of israel
out of the land of egypt by their companies
consecrated to god the people are conducted through the desert by a
pillar of fire in the night and a cloud in the day
and the lord spoke to moses saying
sanctify unto me every firstborn that openeth the womb among the
children of israel as well of men as of beasts for they are all mine
that the firstborn males of the hebrews should be deputed to the
ministry in the divine worship and the firstborn of beasts to be given
for a sacrifice
and moses said to the people remember this day in which you came
forth out of egypt and out of the house of bondage for with a strong
hand hath the lord brought you forth out of this place that you eat no
leavened bread
this day you go forth in the month of new corn
and when the lord shall have brought thee into the land of the
that floweth with milk and honey thou shalt celebrate this manner of
sacred rites in this month
seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day
shall be the solemnity of the lord
unleavened bread shall you eat seven days there shall not be seen
any thing leavened with thee nor in all thy coasts
and thou shalt tell thy son in that day saying this is what the
and it shall be as a sign in thy hand and as a memorial before
thy eyes and that the law of the lord be always in thy mouth for with
a strong hand the lord hath brought thee out of the land of egypt
thou shalt keep this observance at the set time from days to
days
and when the lord shall have brought thee into the land of the
thou shalt set apart all that openeth the womb for the lord and
all that is first brought forth of thy cattle whatsoever thou shalt
have of the male sex thou shalt consecrate to the lord
the firstborn of an ass thou shalt change for a sheep and if
thou do not redeem it thou shalt kill it and every firstborn of men
thou shalt redeem with a price
and when thy son shall ask thee to morrow saying what is this
thou shalt answer him with a strong hand did the lord bring us forth
out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage
for when pharao was hardened and would not let us go the lord
slew every firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of man to
the firstborn of beasts therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that
openeth the womb of the male sex and all the firstborn of my sons i
redeem
and it shall be as a sign in thy hand and as a thing hung
between thy eyes for a remembrance because the lord hath brought us
forth out of egypt by a strong hand
and when pharao had sent out the people the lord led them not by
the way of the land of the philistines which is near thinking lest
perhaps they would repent if they should see wars arise against them
and would return into egypt
but he led them about by the way of the desert which is by the
and moses took josephs bones with him because he had adjured
the children of israel saying god shall visit you carry out my bones
from hence with you
and marching from socoth they encamped in etham in the utmost
coasts of the wilderness
and the lord went before them to shew the way by day in a pillar
of a cloud and by night in a pillar of fire that he might be the guide
of their journey at both times
there never failed the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar
of fire by night before the people
are encouraged by him and pass through the red sea pharao and his army
following them are drowned
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel let them turn and encamp over
against phihahiroth which is between magdal and the sea over against
and pharao will say of the children of israel they are straitened
in the land the desert hath shut them in
and i shall harden his heart and he will pursue you and i shall
be glorified in pharao and in all his army and the egyptians shall
know that i am the lord and they did so
and it was told the king of the egyptians that the people was
fled and the heart of pharao and of his servants was changed with
regard to the people and they said what meant we to do that we let
so he made ready his chariot and took all his people with him
and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots that
were in egypt and the captains of the whole army
and the lord hardened the heart of pharao king of egypt and he
pursued the children of israel but they were gone forth in a mighty
hand
and when the egyptians followed the steps of them who were gone
before they found them encamped at the sea side all pharaos horse and
chariots and the whole army were in phihahiroth before beelsephon
and when pharao drew near the children of israel lifting up
their eyes saw the egyptians behind them and they feared exceedingly
and cried to the lord
and they said to moses perhaps there were no graves in egypt
therefore thou hast brought us to die in the wilderness why wouldst
thou do this to lead us out of egypt
is not this the word that we spoke to thee in egypt saying
to serve them than to die in the wilderness
and moses said to the people fear not stand and see the great
wonders of the lord which he will do this day for the egyptians whom
you see now you shall see no more for ever
the lord will fight for you and you shall hold your peace
and the lord said to moses why criest thou to me speak to the
children of israel to go forward
but lift thou up thy rod and stretch forth thy hand over the
sea and divide it that the children of israel may go through the midst
of the sea on dry ground
and i will harden the heart of the egyptians to pursue you and i
will be glorified in pharao and in all his host and in his chariots
and in his horsemen
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i shall be
glorified in pharao and in his chariots and in his horsemen
and the angel of god who went before the camp of israel
removing went behind them and together with him the pillar of the
cloud leaving the forepart
stood behind between the egyptians camp and the camp of israel
and it was a dark cloud and enlightening the night so that they could
not come at one another all the night
great light
and when moses had stretched forth his hand over the sea the
and turned it into dry ground and the water was divided
and the children of israel went in through the midst of the sea
dried up for the water was as a wall on their right hand and on their
left
and the egyptians pursuing went in after them and all pharaos
horses his chariots and horsemen through the midst of the sea
and now the morning watch was come and behold the lord looking
upon the egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of the cloud slew
their host
and overthrew the wheels of the chariots and they were carried
into the deep and the egyptians said let us flee from israel for the
and the lord said to moses stretch forth thy hand over the sea
that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their chariots
and horsemen
and when moses had stretched forth his hand towards the sea it
returned at the first break of day to the former place and as the
shut them up in the middle of the waves
and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the
horsemen of all the army of pharao who had come into the sea after
them neither did there so much as one of them remain
but the children of israel marched through the midst of the sea
upon dry land and the waters were to them as a wall on the right hand
and on the left
and the lord delivered israel in that day out of the hands of the
and they saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore and the
mighty hand that the lord had used against them and the people feared
the lord and they believed the lord and moses his servant
then moses and the children of israel sung this canticle to the
the horse and the rider he hath thrown into the sea
the lord is my strength and my praise and he is become salvation
to me he is my god and i will glorify him the god of my father and i
will exalt him
the lord is as a man of war almighty is his name
pharaos chariots and his army he hath cast into the sea his
chosen captains are drowned in the red sea
the depths have covered them they are sunk to the bottom like a
stone
thy right hand o lord is magnified in strength thy right hand
and in the multitude of thy glory thou hast put down thy
adversaries thou hast sent thy wrath which hath devoured them like
stubble
and with the blast of thy anger the waters were gathered together
the flowing water stood the depths were gathered together in the midst
of the sea
the enemy said i will pursue and overtake i will divide the
spoils my soul shall have its fill i will draw my sword my hand shall
slay them
thy wind blew and the sea covered them they sunk as lead in the
mighty waters
who is like to thee among the strong o lord who is like to
thee glorious in holiness terrible and praiseworthy doing wonders
thou stretchedst forth thy hand and the earth swallowed them
in thy mercy thou hast been a leader to the people which thou
hast redeemed and in thy strength thou hast carried them to thy holy
habitation
nations rose up and were angry sorrows took hold on the
inhabitants of philisthiim
then were the princes of edom troubled trembling seized on the
stout men of moab all the inhabitants of chanaan became stiff
let fear and dread fall upon them in the greatness of thy arm
let them become immoveable as a stone until thy people o lord pass
by until this thy people pass by which thou hast possessed
thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thy
inheritance in thy most firm habitation which thou hast made o lord
thy sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established
the lord shall reign for ever and ever
for pharao went in on horseback with his chariots and horsemen
into the sea and the lord brought back upon them the waters of the sea
but the children of israel walked on dry ground in the midst thereof
so mary the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in
her hand and all the women went forth after her with timbrels and with
dances
and she began the song to them saying let us sing to the lord
for he is gloriously magnified the horse and his rider he hath thrown
into the sea
and moses brought israel from the red sea and they went forth
into the wilderness of sur and they marched three days through the
wilderness and found no water
and they came into mara and they could not drink the waters of
to the place calling it mara that is bitterness
and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we
drink
but he cried to the lord and he shewed him a tree which when he
had cast into the waters they were turned into sweetness there he
appointed him ordinances and judgments and there he proved him
saying if thou wilt hear the voice of the lord thy god and do
what is right before him and obey his commandments and keep all his
precepts none of the evils that i laid upon egypt will i bring upon
thee for i am the lord thy healer
and the children of israel came into elim where there were
twelve fountains of water and seventy palm trees and they encamped by
the waters
and they set forward from elim and all the multitude of the
children of israel came into the desert of sin which is between elim
and sinai the fifteenth day of the second month after they came out of
the land of egypt
and all the congregation of the children of israel murmured
against moses and aaron in the wilderness
and the children of israel said to them would to god we had died
by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat over the
fleshpots and ate bread to the full why have you brought us into this
desert that you might destroy all the multitude with famine
and the lord said to moses behold i will rain bread from heaven
for you let the people go forth and gather what is sufficient for
every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or
not
but the sixth day let them provide for to bring in and let it be
double to that they were wont to gather every day
and moses and aaron said to the children of israel in the evening
you shall know that the lord hath brought you forth out of the land of
and in the morning you shall see the glory of the lord for he
hath heard your murmuring against the lord but as for us what are we
that you mutter against us
and moses said in the evening the lord will give you flesh to
eat and in the morning bread to the full for he hath heard your
murmurings with which you have murmured against him for what are we
your murmuring is not against us but against the lord
moses also said to aaron say to the whole congregation of the
children of israel come before the lord for he hath heard your
murmuring
and when aaron spoke to all the assembly of the children of
and the lord spoke to moses saying
i have heard the murmuring of the children of israel say to
them in the evening you shall eat flesh and in the morning you shall
have your fill of bread and you shall know that i am the lord your god
so it came to pass in the evening that quails coming up covered
the camp and in the morning a dew lay round about the camp
and when it had covered the face of the earth it appeared in the
wilderness small and as it were beaten with a pestle like unto the
hoar frost on the ground
and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another
to eat
this is the word that the lord hath commanded let every one
gather of it as much as is enough to eat a gomor for every man
according to the number of your souls that dwell in a tent so shall you
take of it
and the children of israel did so and they gathered one more
another less
and they measured by the measure of a gomor neither had he more
that had gathered more nor did he find less that had provided less but
every one had gathered according to what they were able to eat
and moses said to them let no man leave thereof till the
morning
and they hearkened not to him but some of them left until the
morning and it began to be full of worms and it putrified and moses
was angry with them
now every one of them gathered in the morning as much as might
suffice to eat and after the sun grew hot it melted
but on the sixth day they gathered twice as much that is two
gomors every man and all the rulers of the multitude came and told
and he said to them this is what the lord hath spoken to morrow
is the rest of the sabbath sanctified to the lord whatsoever work is to
be done do it and the meats that are to be dressed dress them and
whatsoever shall remain lay it up until the morning
and they did so as moses had commanded and it did not putrify
neither was there worm found in it
and moses said eat it to day because it is the sabbath of the
gather it six days but on the seventh day is the sabbath of the
and the seventh day came and some of the people going forth to
gather found none
and the lord said to moses how long will you refuse to keep my
commandments and my law
see that the lord hath given you the sabbath and for this reason
on the sixth day he giveth you a double provision let each man stay at
home and let none go forth out of his place the seventh day
and the people kept the sabbath on the seventh day
and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was
like coriander seed white and the taste thereof like to flour with
honey
and moses said this is the word which the lord hath commanded
hereafter that they may know the bread wherewith i fed you in the
wilderness when you were brought forth out of the land of egypt
and moses said to aaron take a vessel and put manna into it as
much as a gomor can hold and lay it up before the lord to keep unto
your generations
as the lord commanded moses and aaron put it in the tabernacle
to be kept
and the children of israel ate manna forty years till they came
to a habitable land with this meat were they fed until they reached
the borders of the land of chanaan
now a gomor is the tenth part of an ephi
out of a rock moses lifting up his hand in prayer amalec is overcome
then all the multitude of the children of israel setting forward
from the desert of sin by their mansions according to the word of the
drink
and they chode with moses and said give us water that we may
drink and moses answered them why chide you with me wherefore do you
tempt the lord
so the people were thirsty there for want of water and murmured
against moses saying why didst thou make us go forth out of egypt to
kill us and our children and our beasts with thirst
and moses cried to the lord saying what shall i do to this
people yet a little more and they will stone me
and the lord said to moses go before the people and take with
thee of the ancients of israel and take in thy hand the rod wherewith
thou didst strike the river and go
behold i will stand there before thee upon the rock horeb and
thou shalt strike the rock and water shall come out of it that the
people may drink moses did so before the ancients of israel
and he called the name of that place temptation because of the
chiding of the children of israel and for that they tempted the lord
saying is the lord amongst us or not
and amalec came and fought against israel in raphidim
and moses said to josue choose out men and go out and fight
against amalec tomorrow i will stand on the top of the hill having the
rod of god in my hand
josue did as moses had spoken and he fought against amalec but
and when moses lifted up his hands israel overcame but if he
let them down a little amalec overcame
and mosess hands were heavy so they took a stone and put under
him and he sat on it and aaron and hur stayed up his hands on both
sides and it came to pass that his hands were not weary until sunset
and josue put amalec and his people to flight by the edge of the
sword
and the lord said to moses write this for a memorial in a book
and deliver it to the ears of josue for i will destroy the memory of
and moses built an altar and called the name thereof the lord
my exaltation saying
because the hand of the throne of the lord and the war of the
and when jethro the priest of madian the kinsman of moses had
heard all the things that god had done to moses and to israel his
people and that the lord had brought forth israel out of egypt
he took sephora the wife of moses whom he had sent back
and her two sons of whom one was called gersam his father
saying i have been a stranger in a foreign country
and the other eliezer for the god of my father said he is my
helper and hath delivered me from the sword of pharao
and jethro the kinsman of moses came with his sons and his wife
to moses into the desert where he was camped by the mountain of god
and he sent word to moses saying i jethro thy kinsman come to
thee and thy wife and thy two sons with her
and he went out to meet his kinsman and worshipped and kissed
him and they saluted one another with words of peace and when he was
come into the tent
moses told his kinsman all that the lord had done to pharao and
the egyptians in favour of israel and all the labour which had befallen
them in the journey and that the lord had delivered them
and jethro rejoiced for all the good things that the lord had done
to israel because he had delivered them out of the hands of the
and he said blessed is the lord who hath delivered his people
out of the hand of egypt
now i know that the lord is great above all gods because they
dealt proudly against them
so jethro the kinsman of moses offered holocausts and
sacrifices to god and aaron and all the ancients of israel came to eat
bread with him before god
and the next day moses sat to judge the people who stood by
and when his kinsman had seen all things that he did among the
people he said what is it that thou dost among the people why sittest
thou alone and all the people wait from morning till night
and moses answered him the people come to me to seek the
judgment of god
and when any controversy falleth out among them they come to me
to judge between them and to shew the precepts of god and his laws
but he said the thing thou dost is not good
thou art spent with foolish labour both thou and this people
that is with thee the business is above thy strength thou alone canst
not bear it
but hear my words and counsels and god shall be with thee be
thou to the people in those things that pertain to god to bring their
words to him
and to shew the people the ceremonies and the manner of
worshipping and the way wherein they ought to walk and the work that
they ought to do
and provide out of all the people able men such as fear god in
whom there is truth and that hate avarice and appoint of them rulers
of thousands and of hundreds and of fifties and of tens
who may judge the people at all times and when any great matter
soever shall fall out let them refer it to thee and let them judge the
lesser matters only that so it may be lighter for thee the burden
being shared out unto others
if thou dost this thou shalt fulfil the commandment of god and
shalt be able to bear his precepts and all this people shall return to
their places with peace
and when moses heard this he did all things that he had
suggested unto him
and choosing able men out of all israel he appointed them rulers
of the people rulers over thousands and over hundreds and over
fifties and over tens
and they judged the people at all times and whatsoever was of
greater difficulty they referred to him and they judged the easier
cases only
and he let his kinsman depart and he returned and went into his
own country
coming in thunder and lightning speaketh with moses
in the third month of the departure of israel out of the land of
for departing out of raphidim and coming to the desert of sinai
they camped in the same place and there israel pitched their tents over
against the mountain
and moses went up to god and the lord called unto him from the
mountain and said thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell
the children of israel
spoke to him
you have seen what i have done to the egyptians how i have
carried you upon the wings of eagles and have taken you to myself
if therefore you will hear my voice and keep my covenant you
shall be my peculiar possession above all people for all the earth is
mine
and you shall be to me a priestly kingdom and a holy nation
moses came and calling together the elders of the people he
declared all the words which the lord had commanded
and all the people answered together all that the lord hath
spoken we will do and when moses had related the peoples words to the
the lord said to him lo now will i come to thee in the darkness
of a cloud that the people may hear me speaking to thee and may
believe thee for ever and moses told the words of the people to the
and he said to him go to the people and sanctify them to day
and to morrow and let them wash their garments
and let them be ready against the third day for on the third day
the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount
and thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people round about
and thou shalt say to them take heed ye go not up into the mount and
that ye touch not the borders thereof every one that toucheth the
mount dying he shall die
no hands shall touch him but he shall be stoned to death or he
shall be shot through with arrows whether it be beast or man he shall
not live when the trumpet shall begin to sound then let them go up
into the mount
and moses came down from the mount to the people and sanctified
them and when they had washed their garments
he said to them be ready against the third day and come not
near your wives
and now the third day was come and the morning appeared and
behold thunders began to be heard and lightning to flash and a very
thick cloud to cover the mount and the noise of the trumpet sounded
exceeding loud and the people that was in the camp feared
and when moses had brought them forth to meet god from the place
of the camp they stood at the bottom of the mount
and all mount sinai was on a smoke because the lord was come
down upon it in fire and the smoke arose from it as out of a furnace
and all the mount was terrible
and the sound of the trumpet grew by degrees louder and louder
and was drawn out to a greater length moses spoke and god answered
him
and the lord came down upon mount sinai in the very top of the
mount and he called moses unto the top thereof and when he was gone up
thither
he said unto him go down and charge the people lest they
should have a mind to pass the limits to see the lord and a very great
multitude of them should perish
the priests also that come to the lord let them be sanctified
lest he strike them
and moses said to the lord the people cannot come up to mount
mount and sanctify it
and the lord said to him go get thee down and thou shalt come
up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people
pass the limits nor come up to the lord lest he kill them
and moses went down to the people and told them all
and the lord spoke all these words
i am the lord thy god who brought thee out of the land of egypt
out of the house of bondage
thou shalt not have strange gods before me
thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing nor the likeness of
any thing that is in heaven above or in the earth beneath nor of those

commandments

his god in vain

but on the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god thou
shalt do no work on it thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy
manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy beast nor the stranger that is
within thy gates
for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and the sea and

of the trumpet and the mount smoking and being terrified and struck
with fear they stood afar off
saying to moses speak thou to us and we will hear let not the
and moses said to the people fear not for god is come to prove
you and that the dread of him might be in you and you should not sin
and the people stood afar off but moses went to the dark cloud

blood of the testament upon the people then goeth up the mountain which
and he said to moses come up to the lord thou and aaron nadab
and abiu and seventy of the ancients of israel and you shall adore
afar off
and moses alone shall come up to the lord but they shall not come
nigh neither shall the people come up with him
so moses came and told the people all the words of the lord and
all the judgments and all the people answered with one voice we will
do all the words of the lord which he hath spoken
and moses wrote all the words of the lord and rising in the
morning he built an altar at the foot of the mount and twelve titles
according to the twelve tribes of israel
and he sent young men of the children of israel and they offered
holocausts and sacrificed pacific victims of calves to the lord
consumed with fire upon the altar
then moses took half of the blood and put it into bowls and the
rest he poured upon the altar
and taking the book of the covenant he read it in the hearing of
the people and they said all things that the lord hath spoken we will
do we will be obedient
and he took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people and he
said this is the blood of the covenant which the lord hath made with
you concerning all these words
then moses and aaron nadab and abiu and seventy of the ancients
of israel went up
and they saw the god of israel and under his feet as it were a
work of sapphire stone and as the heaven when clear
neither did he lay his hand upon those of the children of israel
that retired afar off and they saw god and they did eat and drink
and the lord said to moses come up to me into the mount and be
there and i will give thee tables of stone and the law and the
commandments which i have written that thou mayest teach them
moses rose up and his minister josue and moses going up into
the mount of god
said to the ancients wait ye here till we return to you you
have aaron and hur with you if any question shall arise you shall
refer it to them
and when moses was gone up a cloud covered the mount
and the glory of the lord dwelt upon sinai covering it with a
cloud six days and the seventh day he called him out of the midst of
the cloud
and the sight of the glory of the lord was like a burning fire
upon the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel
and moses entering into the midst of the cloud went up into the
mountain and he was there forty days and forty nights
candlestick etc
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel that they bring firstfruits to
me of every man that offereth of his own accord you shall take them
goods
and these are the things you must take gold and silver and
brass
violet and purple and scarlet twice dyed and fine linen and
goats hair
and rams skins dyed red and violet skins and setim wood
said to be incorruptible
oil to make lights spices for ointment and for sweetsmelling
incense
onyx stones and precious stones to adorn the ephod and the
rational
vestment and the rational his vestplate in which were twelve gems
etc
and they shall make me a sanctuary and i will dwell in the midst
of them
according to all the likeness of the tabernacle which i will shew
thee and of all the vessels for the service thereof and thus you shall
make it
frame an ark of setim wood the length whereof shall be of two
cubits and a half the breadth a cubit and a half the height
likewise a cubit and a half
and thou shalt overlay it with the purest gold within and
without and over it thou shalt make a golden crown round about
and four golden rings which thou shalt put at the four corners
of the ark let two rings be on the one side and two on the other
thou shalt make bars also of setim wood and shalt overlay them
with gold
and thou shalt put them in through the rings that are in the
sides of the ark that it may be carried on them
and they shall be always in the rings neither shall they at any
time be drawn out of them
and thou shalt put in the ark the testimony which i will give
thee
thou shalt make also a propitiatory of the purest gold the
length thereof shall be two cubits and a half and the breadth a cubit
and a half
mercy seat because the lord who was supposed to sit there upon the
wings of the cherubims with the ark for his footstool from thence
shewed mercy it is also called the oracle ver and because from
thence god gave his orders and his answers
thou shalt make also two cherubims of beaten gold on the two
sides of the oracle
let one cherub be on the one side and the other on the other
let them cover both sides of the propitiatory spreading their
wings and covering the oracle and let them look one towards the other
their faces being turned towards the propitiatory wherewith the ark is
to be covered
in which thou shalt put the testimony that i will give thee
thence will i give orders and will speak to thee over the
propitiatory and from the midst of the two cherubims which shall be
upon the ark of the testimony all things which i will command the
children of israel by thee
thou shalt make a table also of setim wood of two cubits in
length and a cubit in breadth and a cubit and a half in height
or as they are called in the hebrew the face bread because they were
always to stand before the face of the lord in his temple as a figure
of the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament in the church of christ
and thou shalt overlay it with the purest gold and thou shalt
make to it a golden ledge round about
and to the ledge itself a polished crown four inches high and
over the same another little golden crown
thou shalt prepare also four golden rings and shalt put them in
the four corners of the same table over each foot
under the crown shall the golden rings be that the bars may be
put through them and the table may be carried
the bars also themselves thou shalt make of setim wood and shalt
overlay them with gold to bear up the table
thou shalt prepare also dishes and bowls censers and cups
wherein the libations are to be offered of the purest gold
and thou shalt set upon the table loaves of proposition in my
sight always
thou shalt make also a candlestick of beaten work of the finest

their generations it is an everlasting covenant
between me and the children of israel and a perpetual sign for
in six days the lord made heaven and earth and in the seventh he ceased
from work
and the lord when he had ended these words in mount sinai gave
to moses two stone tables of testimony written with the finger of god
tables destroyeth the idol blameth aaron and causeth many of the
idolaters to be slain
and the people seeing that moses delayed to come down from the
mount gathering together against aaron said arise make us gods that
may go before us for as to this moses the man that brought us out of
the land of egypt we know not what has befallen him
and aaron said to them take the golden earrings from the ears of
your wives and your sons and daughters and bring them to me
and the people did what he had commanded bringing the earrings to
and when he had received them he fashioned them by founders
work and made of them a molten calf and they said these are thy gods
and when aaron saw this he built an altar before it and made
proclamation by a criers voice saying to morrow is the solemnity of
the lord
and rising in the morning they offered holocausts and peace
victims and the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to
play
and the lord spoke to moses saying go get thee down thy
people which thou hast brought out of the land of egypt hath sinned
they have quickly strayed from the way which thou didst shew them
and they have made to themselves a molten calf and have adored it and
sacrificing victims to it have said these are thy gods o israel that
have brought thee out of the land of egypt
and again the lord said to moses i see that this people is
stiffnecked
let me alone that my wrath may be kindled against them and that
but moses besought the lord his god saying why o lord is thy
indignation enkindled against thy people whom thou hast brought out of
the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand
let not the egyptians say i beseech thee he craftily brought
them out that he might kill them in the mountains and destroy them
from the earth let thy anger cease and be appeased upon the wickedness
of thy people
remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou
sworest by thy own self saying i will multiply your seed as the stars
of heaven and this whole land that i have spoken of i will give to
your seed and you shall possess it for ever
and the lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken
against his people
and moses returned from the mount carrying the two tables of the
testimony in his hand written on both sides
and made by the work of god the writing also of god was graven
in the tables
and josue hearing the noise of the people shouting said to
but he answered it is not the cry of men encouraging to fight
nor the shout of men compelling to flee but i hear the voice of
singers
and when he came nigh to the camp he saw the calf and the
dances and being very angry he threw the tables out of his hand and
broke them at the foot of the mount
and laying hold of the calf which they had made he burnt it and
beat it to powder which he strewed into water and gave thereof to the
children of israel to drink
and he said to aaron what has this people done to thee that
thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous sin
and he answered him let not my lord be offended for thou
knowest this people that they are prone to evil
they said to me make us gods that may go before us for as to
this moses who brought us forth out of the land of egypt we know not
what is befallen him
and i said to them which of you hath any gold and they took and
brought it to me and i cast it into the fire and this calf came out
and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had
stripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth and had set them
naked among their enemies
worst of all being stripped also of the grace of god and having lost
himthe shame of the filth that is of the idol which they had
taken for their god it is the usual phrase of the scripture to call
idols filth and abominations
then standing in the gate of the camp he said if any man be on
the lords side let him join with me and all the sons of levi gathered
themselves together unto him
and he said to them thus saith the lord god of israel put every
man his sword upon his thigh go and return from gate to gate through
the midst of the camp and let every man kill his brother and friend
and neighbour
and the sons of levi did according to the words of moses and
there were slain that day about three and twenty thousand men
and moses said you have consecrated your hands this day to the
given to you
and when the next day was come moses spoke to the people you
have sinned a very great sin i will go up to the lord if by any means
and returning to the lord he said i beseech thee this people
hath sinned a heinous sin and they have made to themselves gods of
gold either forgive them this trespass
or if thou do not strike me out of the book that thou hast
written
and the lord answered him he that hath sinned against me him
will i strike out of my book
but go thou and lead this people whither i have told thee my
angel shall go before thee and i in the day of revenge will visit this
sin also of theirs
the lord therefore struck the people for the guilt on occasion
of the calf which aaron had made
the camp he converseth familiarly with god desireth to see his glory
and the lord spoke to moses saying go get thee up from this
place thou and thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of
and i will send an angel before thee that i may cast out the
the hevite and the jebusite
that thou mayst enter into the land that floweth with milk and
honey for i will not go up with thee because thou art a stiffnecked
people lest i destroy thee in the way
and the people hearing these very bad tidings mourned and no man
put on his ornaments according to custom
and the lord said to moses say to the children of israel thou
art a stiffnecked people once i shall come up in the midst of thee and
shall destroy thee now presently lay aside thy ornaments that i may
know what to do to thee
so the children of israel laid aside their ornaments by mount
moses also taking the tabernacle pitched it without the camp afar
off and called the name thereof the tabernacle of the covenant and
all the people that had any question went forth to the tabernacle of
the covenant without the camp
and when moses went forth to the tabernacle all the people rose
up and every one stood in the door of his pavilion and they beheld the
back of moses till he went into the tabernacle
and when he was gone into the tabernacle of the covenant the
pillar of the cloud came down and stood at the door and he spoke with
and all saw that the pillar of the cloud stood at the door of the
tabernacle and they stood and worshipped at the doors of their tent
and the lord spoke to moses face to face as a man is wont to
speak to his friend and when he returned into the camp his servant
from this very chapter moses could not see the face of the lord
and moses said to the lord thou commandest me to lead forth this
people and thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me
especially whereas thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast
found favour in my sight
know such as he approves and loves and to know by name those whom he
favours in a most singular manner as he did his servant moses
if therefore i have found favour in thy sight shew me thy face
that i may know thee and may find grace before thy eyes look upon thy
people this nation
and the lord said my face shall go before thee and i will give
thee rest
and moses said if thou thyself dost not go before bring us not
out of this place
for how shall we be able to know i and thy people that we have
found grace in thy sight unless thou walk with us that we may be
glorified by all people that dwell upon the earth
and the lord said to moses this word also which thou hast
spoken will i do for thou hast found grace before me and thee i have
known by name
and he said shew me thy glory
he answered i will shew thee all good and i will proclaim in
the name of the lord before thee and i will have mercy on whom i will
and i will be merciful to whom it shall please me
and again he said thou canst not see my face for man shall not
see me and live
and again he said behold there is a place with me and thou
shalt stand upon the rock
and when my glory shall pass i will set thee in a hole of the
rock and protect thee with my righthand till i pass
and i will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back parts
but my face thou canst not see
the pillar of the cloud so that he could not see the glory of him that
spoke familiarly with him in the vision here mentioned he was allowed
to see something of him in an assumed corporeal form not in the face
the rays of which were too bright for mortal eye to bear but to view
him as it were behind when his face was turned from him
precepts concerning the firstborn the sabbath and other feasts after
forty days fast moses returneth to the people with the commandments
and his face appearing horned with rays of light he covereth it
whensoever he speaketh to the people
and after this he said hew thee two tables of stone like unto the
former and i will write upon them the words which were in the tables
which thou brokest
be ready in the morning that thou mayst forthwith go up into
let no man go up with thee and let not any man be seen throughout
all the mount neither let the oxen nor the sheep feed over against it
then he cut out two tables of stone such as had been before and
rising very early he went up into the mount sinai as the lord had
commanded him carrying with him the tables
and when the lord was come down in a cloud moses stood with him
calling upon the name of the lord
and when he passed before him he said o the lord the lord god
merciful and gracious patient and of much compassion and true
who keepest mercy unto thousands who takest away iniquity and
wickedness and sin and no man of himself is innocent before thee who
renderest the iniquity of the fathers to the children and to the
grandchildren unto the third and fourth generation
and moses making haste bowed down prostrate unto the earth and
adoring
said if i have found grace in thy sight o lord i beseech thee
that thou wilt go with us for it is a stiffnecked people and take
away our iniquities and sin and possess us
the lord answered i will make a covenant in the sight of all i
will do signs such as were never seen upon the earth nor in any
nations that this people in the midst of whom thou art may see the
terrible work of the lord which i will do
observe all things which this day i command thee i myself will
drive out before thy face the amorrhite and the chanaanite and the
beware thou never join in friendship with the inhabitants of that
land which may be thy ruin
but destroy their altars break their statues and cut down their
groves
adore not any strange god the lord his name is jealous he is a
jealous god
make no covenant with the men of those countries lest when they
have committed fornication with their gods and have adored their idols
some one call thee to eat of the things sacrificed
neither shalt thou take of their daughters a wife for thy son
lest after they themselves have committed fornication they make thy
sons also to commit fornication with their gods
thou shalt not make to thyself any molten gods
thou shalt keep the feast of the unleavened bread seven days
shalt thou eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee in the time of the
month of the new corn for in the month of the spring time thou camest
out from egypt
all of the malekind that openeth the womb shall be mine of all
beasts both of oxen and of sheep it shall be mine
the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep but if
thou wilt not give a price for it it shall be slain the firstborn of
thy sons thou shalt redeem neither shalt thou appear before me empty
six days shalt thou work the seventh day thou shalt cease to
plough and to reap
thou shalt keep the feast of weeks with the firstfruits of the
corn of thy wheat harvest and the feast when the time of the year
returneth that all things are laid in
three times in the year all thy males shall appear in the sight
of the almighty lord the god of israel
for when i shall have taken away the nations from thy face and
shall have enlarged thy borders no man shall lie in wait against thy
land when thou shalt go up and appear in the sight of the lord thy god
thrice in a year
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice upon leaven
neither shall there remain in the morning any thing of the victim of the
solemnity of the phase
the first of the fruits of thy ground thou shalt offer in the
house of the lord thy god thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of his
dam
and the lord said to moses write thee these words by which i
have made a covenant both with thee and with israel
and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he
neither ate bread nor drank water and he wrote upon the tables the ten
words of the covenant
and when moses came down from the mount sinai he held the two
tables of the testimony and he knew not that his face was horned from
the conversation of the lord
and aaron and the children of israel seeing the face of moses
horned were afraid to come near
and being called by him they returned both aaron and the rulers
of the congregation and after that he spoke to them
and all the children of israel came to him and he gave them in
commandment all that he had heard of the lord on mount sinai
and having done speaking he put a veil upon his face
but when he went in to the lord and spoke with him he took it
away until he came forth and then he spoke to the children of israel
all things that had been commanded him
and they saw that the face of moses when he came out was horned
but he covered his face again if at any time he spoke to them
are called to the work
and all the multitude of the children of israel being gathered
together he said to them these are the things which the lord hath
commanded to be done
six days you shall do work the seventh day shall be holy unto
you the sabbath and the rest of the lord he that shall do any work on
it shall be put to death
you shall kindle no fire in any of your habitations on the sabbath
day
and moses said to all the assembly of the children of israel this
is the word the lord hath commanded saying
set aside with you firstfruits to the lord let every one that is
willing and hath a ready heart offer them to the lord gold and
silver and brass
violet and purple and scarlet twice dyed and fine linen goats
hair
and rams skins dyed red and violet coloured skins setim wood
and oil to maintain lights and to make ointment and most sweet
incense

sanctuary the vesture of aaron the high priest and of his sons to do
the office of priesthood to me
and all the multitude of the children of israel going out from
the presence of moses
offered firstfruits to the lord with a most ready and devout
mind to make the work of the tabernacle of the testimony whatever was
necessary to the service and to the holy vestments
both men and women gave bracelets and earrings rings and
tablets every vessel of gold was set aside to be offered to the lord
if any man had violet and purple and scarlet twice dyed fine
linen and goats hair ramskins dyed red and violet coloured skins
metal of silver and brass they offered it to the lord and setim
wood for divers uses
the skilful women also gave such things as they had spun violet
purple and scarlet and fine linen
and goats hair giving all of their own accord
but the princes offered onyx stones and precious stones for the
ephod and the rational
and spices and oil for the lights and for the preparing of
ointment and to make the incense of most sweet savour
all both men and women with devout mind offered gifts that the
works might be done which the lord had commanded by the hand of moses
and moses said to the children of israel behold the lord hath
called by name beseleel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of
and hath filled him with the spirit of god with wisdom and
understanding and knowledge and all learning
to devise and to work in gold and silver and brass
and in engraving stones and in carpenters work whatsoever can
be devised artificially

dyed and fine linen and to weave all things and to invent all new

made the things that are necessary for the uses of the sanctuary and
which the lord commanded
and when moses had called them and every skilful man to whom the
themselves to the making of the work
he delivered all the offerings of the children of israel unto
them and while they were earnest about the work the people daily in
the morning offered their vows
whereupon the workmen being constrained to come
said to moses the people offereth more than is necessary
moses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the criers
voice let neither man nor woman offer any more for the work of the
sanctuary and so they ceased from offering gifts
because the things that were offered did suffice and were too
much
and all the men that were wise of heart to accomplish the work of
the tabernacle made ten curtains of twisted fine linen and violet and
purple and scarlet twice dyed with varied work and the art of
embroidering
the length of one curtain was twentyeight cubits and the breadth
four all the curtains were of the same size
and he joined five curtains one to another and the other five
he coupled one to another

sides and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner
that the loops might meet one against another and might be
joined each with the other
whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold that might catch the
loops of the curtains and they might be made one tabernacle
he made also eleven curtains of goats hair to cover the roof of
the tabernacle

the tabernacle
of which twenty were at the south side southward
with forty sockets of silver two sockets were put under one
board on the two sides of the corners where the mortises of the sides
end in the corners
at that side also of the tabernacle that looketh towards the
north he made twenty boards
with forty sockets of silver two sockets for every board
but against the west to wit at that side of the tabernacle
which looketh to the sea he made six boards
and two others at each corner of the tabernacle behind
which were also joined from beneath unto the top and went
together into one joint thus he did on both sides at the corners
so there were in all eight boards and they had sixteen sockets
of silver to wit two sockets under every board

of one side of the tabernacle
and five others to join together the boards of the other side

to carry it

gold two cubits and a half in length and a cubit and a half in
breadth
two cherubims also of beaten gold which he set on the two sides
of the propitiatory

from the shaft of the candlestick was equal
and in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut
and bowls withal at every one and lilies
and bowls under two branches in three places which together made
six branches going out from one shaft
so both the bowls and the branches were of the same all beaten

where the snuffings were to be put out of the purest gold

gold
he made also the alter of incense of setim wood being a cubit on
every side foursquare and in height two cubits from the corners of

under it in the midst of the altar a hearth
casting four rings at the four ends of the net at the top to put

and he made the bars of setim wood and overlaid them with plates
of brass
and he drew them through the rings that stood out in the sides of
the altar and the altar itself was not solid but hollow of boards
and empty within
he made also the laver of brass with the foot thereof of the
mirrors of the women that watched at the door of the tabernacle
he made also the court in the south side whereof were hangings of
fine twisted linen of a hundred cubits
twenty pillars of brass with their sockets the beads of the
pillars and the whole graving of the work of silver
in like manner at the north side the hangings the pillars and

priest
which beseleel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of

them small into threads that they might be twisted with the woof of the
foresaid colours

another of the purest gold
and two hooks and as many rings of gold and they set the rings
on either side of the rational
on which rings the two golden chains should hang which they put
into the hooks that stood out in the corners of the ephod
these both before and behind so answered one another that the
ephod and the rational were bound together
being fastened to the girdle and strongly coupled with rings
which a violet fillet joined lest they should flag loose and be moved
one from the other as the lord commanded moses
they made also the tunic of the ephod all of violet

commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle and for the
roof of the covenant
the vestments also which the priests to wit aaron and his
sons use in the sanctuary
the children of israel offered as the lord had commanded
and when moses saw all things finished he blessed them
with his majesty
and the lord spoke to moses saying
the first month the first day of the month thou shalt set up the
tabernacle of the testimony
and shalt put the ark in it and shalt let down the veil before
it
and thou shalt bring in the table and set upon it the things that
are commanded according to the rite the candlestick shall stand with
its lamps
and the altar of gold whereon the incense is burnt before the ark
of the testimony thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the
tabernacle
and before it the altar of holocaust

fill it with water
and thou shalt encompass the court with hangings and the entry
thereof
and thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle
with its vessels that they may be sanctified

of unction that they may be most holy

tabernacle of the testimony and having washed them with water
thou shalt put on them the holy vestments that they may minister
to me and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting
priesthood
and moses did all that the lord had commanded
so in the first month of the second year the first day of the
month the tabernacle was set up
and moses reared it up and placed the boards and the sockets and
the bars and set up the pillars
and spread the roof over the tabernacle putting over it a cover
as the lord had commanded
and he put the testimony in the ark thrusting bars underneath
and the oracle above
and when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle he drew the
veil before it to fulfil the commandment of the lord
and he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony at the
north side without the veil
setting there in order the loaves of proposition as the lord had
commanded moses
he set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony
over against the table on the south side
placing the lamps in order according to the precept of the lord
he set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony
over against the veil
and burnt upon it the incense of spices as the lord had
commanded moses
and he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the
testimony
and the altar of holocaust in the entry of the testimony
offering the holocaust and the sacrifices upon it as the lord had
commanded
and he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and
the altar filling it with water
and moses and aaron and his sons washed their hands and feet
when they went into the tabernacle of the covenant and went to
the altar as the lord had commanded moses
he set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the
altar drawing the hanging in the entry thereof after all things were
perfected
the cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony and the glory
of the lord filled it
neither could moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant the
cloud covering all things and the majesty of the lord shining for the
cloud had covered all
if at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle the
children of israel went forward by their troops
if it hung over they remained in the same place
for the cloud of the lord hung over the tabernacle by day and a
fire by night in the sight of all the children of israel throughout all
their mansions
call it vaicra from the word with which it begins
