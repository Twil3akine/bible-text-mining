land of moab dieth there his sons marry wives of that country and die
without issue noemi returneth home with her daughterinlaw ruth who
refuseth to part with her
in the days of the judges when the judges ruled there came a
famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem juda went to
sojourn in the land of moab with his wife and his two sons
he was named elimelech and his wife noemi and his two sons the
one mahalon and the other chelion ephrathites of bethlehem juda and
entering into the country of moab they abode there
and elimelech the husband of noemi died and she remained with her
sons
and they took wives of the women of moab of which one was called
and they both died to wit mahalon and chelion and the woman was
left alone having lost both her sons and her husband
and she arose to go from the land of moab to her own country with
both her daughtersinlaw for she had heard that the lord had looked
upon his people and had given them food
wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment with
both her daughtersinlaw and being now in the way to return into the
land of juda
she said to them go ye home to your mothers the lord deal
mercifully with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me
may he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands whom
you shall take and she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and
began to weep
and to say we will go on with thee to thy people
but she answered them return my daughters why come ye with me
have i any more sons in my womb that you may hope for husbands of me
return again my daughters and go your ways for i am now spent
with age and not fit for wedlock although i might conceive this night
and bear children
if you would wait till they were grown up and come to mans
estate you would be old women before you marry do not so my
daughters i beseech you for i am grieved the more for your distress
and the hand of the lord is gone out against me
and they lifted up their voice and began to weep again orpha
kissed her motherinlaw and returned ruth stuck close to her mother
inlaw
and noemi said to her behold thy kinswoman is returned to her
people and to her gods go thou with her
false gods she had formerly worshipped but by this manner of speech
insinuated to her that if she would go with her she must renounce her
false gods and return to the lord the god of israel
she answered be not against me to desire that i should leave
thee and depart for whithersoever thou shalt go i will go and where
thou shalt dwell i also will dwell thy people shall be my people and
thy god my god
the land that shall receive thee dying in the same will i die
and there will i be buried the lord do so and so to me and add more
also if aught but death part me and thee
the old testament by which the person wished such and such evils to
fall upon them if they did not do what they said
then noemi seeing that ruth was steadfastly determined to go with
her would not be against it nor persuade her any more to return to her
friends
so they went together and came to bethlehem and when they were
come into the city the report was quickly spread among all and the
women said this is that noemi
but she said to them call me not noemi that is beautiful but
call me mara that is bitter for the almighty hath quite filled me
with bitterness
i went out full and the lord hath brought me back empty why then
do you call me noemi whom the lord hath humbled and the almighty hath
afflicted
so noemi came with ruth the moabitess her daughterinlaw from
the land of her sojournment and returned into bethlehem in the
beginning of the barley harvest
now her husband elimelech had a kinsman a powerful man and very
rich whose name was booz
and ruth the moabitess said to her motherinlaw if thou wilt i
will go into the field and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands
of the reapers wheresoever i shall find grace with a householder that
will be favourable to me and she answered her go my daughter
she went therefore and gleaned the ears of corn after the
reapers and it happened that the owner of that field was booz who was
of the kindred of elimelech
and behold he came out of bethlehem and said to the reapers the
and booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers whose
maid is this
and he answered him this is the moabitess who came with noemi
from the land of moab
and she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain
following the steps of the reapers and she hath been in the field from
morning till now and hath not gone home for one moment
and booz said to ruth hear me daughter do not go to glean in any
other field and do not depart from this place but keep with my maids
and follow where they reap for i have charged my young men not to
molest thee and if thou art thirsty go to the vessels and drink of
the waters whereof the servants drink
she fell on her face and worshipping upon the ground said to
him whence cometh this to me that i should find grace before thy eyes
and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me a woman of
another country
and he answered her all hath been told me that thou hast done to
thy motherinlaw after the death of thy husband and how thou hast left
thy parents and the land wherein thou wast born and art come to a
people which thou knewest not heretofore
the lord render unto thee for thy work and mayst thou receive a
full reward of the lord the god of israel to whom thou art come and
under whose wings thou art fled
and she said i have found grace in thy eyes my lord who hast
comforted me and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid who am not
like to one of thy maids
and booz said to her at mealtime come thou hither and eat of the
bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar so she sat at the side of the
reapers and she heaped to herself frumenty and ate and was filled and
took the leavings
and she arose from thence to glean the ears of corn as before
you hinder her not
and let fall some of your handfuls of purpose and leave them
that she may gather them without shame and let no man rebuke her when
she gathereth them
she gleaned therefore in the field till evening and beating out
with a rod and threshing what she had gleaned she found about the
measure of an ephi of barley that is three bushels
which she took up and returned into the city and shewed it to
her motherinlaw moreover she brought out and gave her of the
remains of her meat wherewith she had been filled
and her motherinlaw said to her where hast thou gleaned today
and where hast thou wrought blessed be he that hath had pity on thee
that he was called booz
and noemi answered her blessed be he of the lord because the
same kindness which he shewed to the living he hath kept also to the
dead and again she said the man is our kinsman
and ruth said he also charged me that i should keep close to his
reapers till all the corn should be reaped
and her motherinlaw said to her it is better for thee my
daughter to go out to reap with his maids lest in another mans field
some one may resist thee
so she kept close to the maids of booz and continued to glean
with them till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns
for her husband by the law of affinity she receiveth a good answer and
six measures of barley
after she was returned to her motherinlaw noemi said to her my
daughter i will seek rest for thee and will provide that it may be
well with thee
this booz with whose maids thou wast joined in the field is our
near kinsman and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the
threshingfloor
wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put on thy best
garments and go down to the barnfloor but let not the man see thee
till he shall have done eating and drinking
and when he shall go to sleep mark the place wherein he sleepeth
and thou shalt go in and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered
towards his feet and shalt lay thyself down there and he will tell
thee what thou must do
she answered whatsoever thou shalt command i will do
and she went down to the barnfloor and did all that her motherin
law had bid her
and when booz had eaten and drunk and was merry he went to sleep
by the heap of sheaves and she came softly and uncovering his feet
laid herself down
and behold when it was now midnight the man was afraid and
troubled and he saw a woman lying at his feet
and he said to her who art thou and she answered i am ruth thy
handmaid spread thy coverlet over thy servant for thou art a near
kinsman
and he said blessed art thou of the lord my daughter and thy
latter kindness has surpassed the former because thou hast not followed
young men either poor or rich
up his name and family by marrying his relation according to the law
and not following after young men for booz it seems was then in
years
fear not therefore but whatsoever thou shalt say to me i will do
to thee for all the people that dwell within the gates of my city know
that thou art a virtuous woman
neither do i deny myself to be near of kin but there is another
nearer than i
rest thou this night and when morning is come if he will take
thee by the right of kindred all is well but if he will not i will
undoubtedly take thee so the lord liveth sleep till the morning
so she slept at his feet till the night was going off and she
arose before men could know one another and booz said beware lest any
man know that thou camest hither
and again he said spread thy mantle wherewith thou art covered
and hold it with both hands and when she spread it and held it he
measured six measures of barley and laid it upon her and she carried
it and went into the city
and came to her motherinlaw who said to her what hast thou
done daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her
and she said behold he hath given me six measures of barley for
he said i will not have thee return empty to thy motherinlaw
and noemi said wait my daughter till we see what end the thing
will have for the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he
hath said
forth obed the grandfather of david
then booz went up to the gate and sat there and when he had seen
the kinsman going by of whom he had spoken before he said to him
calling him by his name turn aside for a little while and sit down
here he turned aside and sat down
and booz taking ten men of the ancients of the city said to them
they sat down and he spoke to the kinsman noemi who is returned
from the country of moab will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our
brother elimelech
i would have thee to understand this and would tell thee before
all that sit here and before the ancients of my people if thou wilt
take possession of it by the right of kindred buy it and possess it
but if it please thee not tell me so that i may know what i have to
do for there is no near kinsman besides thee who art first and me
who am second but he answered i will buy the field
and booz said to him when thou shalt buy the field at the womans
hand thou must take also ruth the moabitess who was the wife of the
deceased to raise up the name of thy kinsman in his inheritance
he answered i yield up my right of next akin for i must not cut
off the posterity of my own family do thou make use of my privilege
which i profess i do willingly forego
now this in former times was the manner in israel between kinsmen
that if at any time one yielded his right to another that the grant
might be sure the man put off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour
this was a testimony of cession of right in israel
so booz said to his kinsman put off thy shoe and immediately he
took it off from his foot
and he said to the ancients and to all the people you are
witnesses this day that i have bought all that was elimelechs and
and have taken to wife ruth the moabitess the wife of mahalon
to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance lest his name be
cut off from among his family and his brethren and his people you i
say are witnesses of this thing
then all the people that were in the gate and the ancients
answered we are witnesses the lord make this woman who cometh into thy
house like rachel and lia who built up the house of israel that she
may be an example of virtue in ephrata and may have a famous name in
and that the house may be as the house of phares whom thamar
bore unto juda of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young
woman
booz therefore took ruth and married her and went in unto her
and the lord gave her to conceive and to bear a son
and the women said to noemi blessed be the lord who hath not
suffered thy family to want a successor that his name should be
preserved in israel
and thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul and cherish thy
old age for he is born of thy daughterinlaw who loveth thee and is
much better to thee than if thou hadst seven sons
and noemi taking the child laid it in her bosom and she carried
it and was a nurse unto it
and the women her neighbours congratulating with her and
saying there is a son born to noemi called his name obed he is the
father of isai the father of david
