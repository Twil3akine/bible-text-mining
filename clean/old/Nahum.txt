enemies
the burden of ninive the book of the vision of nahum the
the lord is a jealous god and a revenger the lord is a revenger
and hath wrath the lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries and he is
angry with his enemies
the lord is patient and great in power and will not cleanse and
acquit the guilty the lords ways are in a tempest and a whirlwind
and clouds are the dust of his feet
he rebuketh the sea and drieth it up and bringeth all the rivers
to be a desert basan languisheth and carmel and the flower of libanus
fadeth away
the mountains tremble at him and the hills are made desolate and
the earth hath quaked at his presence and the world and all that dwell
therein
who can stand before the face of his indignation and who shall
resist in the fierceness of his anger his indignation is poured out
like fire and the rocks are melted by him
the lord is good and giveth strength in the day of trouble and
knoweth them that hope in him
but with a flood that passeth by he will make an utter end of the
place thereof and darkness shall pursue his enemies
what do ye devise against the lord he will make an utter end
there shall not rise a double affliction
for as thorns embrace one another so while they are feasting and
drinking together they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry
out of thee shall come forth one that imagineth evil against the
his attempt against the people seems to have been prior to the prophecy
of nahum we may better understand it of holofernes
thus saith the lord though they were perfect and many of them
so yet thus shall they be cut off and he shall pass i have afflicted
thee and i will afflict thee no more
their forces may be they shall be cut off and their prince or leader
shall pass away and disappear
and now i will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy
back and i will burst thy bonds asunder
and the lord will give a commandment concerning thee that no more
of thy name shall be sown i will destroy the graven and molten thing
out of the house of thy god i will make it thy grave for thou art
disgraced
behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings and that preacheth peace o juda keep thy festivals and pay
thy vows for belial shall no more pass through thee again he is
utterly cut off
he is come up that shall destroy before thy face that shall keep
the siege watch the way fortify thy loins strengthen thy power
exceedingly
for the lord hath rendered the pride of jacob as the pride of
vine branches
pride and therefore ninive must not expect to escape or else
rendering the pride of jacob means rewarding that is punishing ninive
for the pride they exercised against jacob
the shield of his mighty men is like fire the men of the army are
clad in scarlet the reins of the chariot are flaming in the day of his
preparation and the drivers are stupefied
destroy niniveibid stupefied consopiti that is they drive on
furiously like men intoxicated with wine
they are in confusion in the ways the chariots jostle one against
another in the streets their looks are like torches like lightning
running to and fro
he will muster up his valiant men they shall stumble in their
march they shall quickly get upon the walls thereof and a covering
shall be prepared
the gates of the rivers are opened and the temple is thrown down
to the ground
and the soldier is led away captive and her bondwomen were led
away mourning as doves murmuring in their hearts
and as for ninive her waters are like a great pool but the men
flee away they cry stand stand but there is none that will return
back
take ye the spoil of the silver take the spoil of the gold for
there is no end of the riches of all the precious furniture
she is destroyed and rent and torn the heart melteth and the
knees fail and all the loins lose their strength and the faces of them
all are as the blackness of a kettle
where is now the dwelling of the lions and the feeding place of
the young lions to which the lion went to enter in thither the young
lion and there was none to make them afraid
the lion caught enough for his whelps and killed for his
lionesses and he filled his holes with prey and his den with rapine
behold i come against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will
burn thy chariots even to smoke and the sword shall devour thy young
lions and i will cut off thy prey out of the land and the voice of thy
messengers shall be heard no more
woe to thee o city of blood all full of lies and violence rapine
shall not depart from thee
the noise of the whip and the noise of the rattling of the wheels
and of the neighing horse and of the running chariot and of the
horsemen coming up
and of the shining sword and of the glittering spear and of a
multitude slain and of a grievous destruction and there is no end of
carcasses and they shall fall down on their dead bodies
because of the multitude of the fornications of the harlot that was
beautiful and agreeable and that made use of witchcraft that sold
nations through her fornications and families through her witchcrafts
behold i come against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will
discover thy shame to thy face and will shew thy nakedness to the
nations and thy shame to kingdoms
and i will cast abominations upon thee and will disgrace thee and
will make an example of thee
and it shall come to pass that every one that shall see thee shall
flee from thee and shall say ninive is laid waste who shall bemoan
thee whence shall i seek a comforter for thee
art thou better than the populous alexandria that dwelleth among
the rivers waters are round about it the sea is its riches the waters
are its walls
the chaldeans and afterwards rebuilt by alexander and called
ethiopia and egypt were the strength thereof and there is no end
yet she also was removed and carried into captivity her young
children were dashed in pieces at the top of every street and they cast
lots upon her nobles and all her great men were bound in fetters
therefore thou also shalt be made drunk and shalt be despised
and thou shalt seek help from the enemies
all thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with their green
figs if they be shaken they shall fall into the mouth of the eater
behold thy people in the midst of thee are women the gates of thy
land shall be set wide open to thy enemies the fire shall devour thy
bars
draw thee water for the siege build up thy bulwarks go into the
clay and tread work it and make brick
there shall the fire devour thee thou shalt perish by the sword
it shall devour thee like the bruchus assemble together like the
bruchus make thyself many like the locust
thou hast multiplied thy merchandises above the stars of heaven
the bruchus hath spread himself and flown away
thy guards are like the locusts and thy little ones like the
locusts of locusts which swarm on the hedges in the day of cold the sun
arose and they flew away and their place was not known where they
were
thy shepherds have slumbered o king of assyria thy princes shall
be buried thy people are hid in the mountains and there is none to
gather them
thy destruction is not hidden thy wound is grievous all that
have heard the fame of thee have clapped their hands over thee for
upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually
before the invasion of the chaldeans which he foretold he lived to see
this prophecy fulfilled and for many years after according to the
general opinion which supposes him to be the same that was brought by
the angel to daniel in babylon dan
