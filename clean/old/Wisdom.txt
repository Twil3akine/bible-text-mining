desireth not our death
love justice you that are the judges of the earth think of the
for he is found by them that tempt him not and he sheweth himself
to them that have faith in him
for perverse thoughts separate from god and his power when it is
tried reproveth the unwise
for wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul nor dwell in a
body subject to sins
for the holy spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful and
will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding and
he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in
for the spirit of wisdom is benevolent and will not acquit the
evil speaker from his lips for god is witness of his reins and he is a
true searcher of his heart and a hearer of his tongue
for the spirit of the lord hath filled the whole world and that
which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice
therefore he that speaketh unjust things cannot be hid neither
shall the chastising judgment pass him by
for inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly and
the hearing of his words shall come to god to the chastising of his
iniquities
for the ear of jealousy heareth all things and the tumult of
murmuring shall not be hid
keep yourselves therefore from murmuring which profiteth
nothing and refrain your tongue from detraction for an obscure speech
shall not go for nought and the mouth that belieth killeth the soul
seek not death in the error of your life neither procure ye
destruction by the works of your hands
for god made not death neither hath he pleasure in the
destruction of the living
for he created all things that they might be and he made the
nations of the earth for health and there is no poison of destruction
in them nor kingdom of hell upon the earth
for justice is perpetual and immortal
but the wicked with works and words have called it to them and
esteeming it a friend have fallen away and have made a covenant with
it because they are worthy to be of the part thereof
especially the son of god
for they have said reasoning with themselves but not right the
time of our life is short and tedious and in the end of a man there is
no remedy and no man hath been known to have returned from hell
for we are born of nothing and after this we shall be as if we had
not been for the breath in our nostrils is smoke and speech a spark to
move our heart
which being put out our body shall be ashes and our spirit shall
be poured abroad as soft air and our life shall pass away as the trace
of a cloud and shall be dispersed as a mist which is driven away by
the beams of the sun and overpowered with the heat thereof
and our name in time shall be forgotten and no man shall have any
remembrance of our works
for our time is as the passing of a shadow and there is no going
back of our end for it is fast sealed and no man returneth
come therefore and let us enjoy the good things that are present
and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth
let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments and let not
the flower of the time pass by us
let us crown ourselves with roses before they be withered let no
meadow escape our riot
let none of us go without his part in luxury let us every where
leave tokens of joy for this is our portion and this our lot
let us oppress the poor just man and not spare the widow nor
honour the ancient grey hairs of the aged
but let our strength be the law of justice for that which is
feeble is found to be nothing worth
let us therefore lie in wait for the just because he is not for
our turn and he is contrary to our doings and upbraideth us with
transgressions of the law and divulgeth against us the sins of our way
of life
he boasteth that he hath the knowledge of god and calleth himself
the son of god
he is become a censurer of our thoughts
he is grievous unto us even to behold for his life is not like
other mens and his ways are very different
we are esteemed by him as triflers and he abstaineth from our
ways as from filthiness and he preferreth the latter end of the just
and glorieth that he hath god for his father
let us see then if his words be true and let us prove what shall
happen to him and we shall know what his end shall be
for if he be the true son of god he will defend him and will
deliver him from the hands of his enemies
let us examine him by outrages and tortures that we may know his
meekness and try his patience
let us condemn him to a most shameful death for there shall be
respect had unto him by his words
these things they thought and were deceived for their own malice
blinded them
and they knew not the secrets of god nor hoped for the wages of
justice nor esteemed the honour of holy souls
for god created man incorruptible and to the image of his own
likeness he made him
but by the envy of the devil death came into the world
and they follow him that are of his side
but the souls of the just are in the hand of god and the torment
of death shall not touch them
in the sight of the unwise they seemed to die and their departure
was taken for misery
and their going away from us for utter destruction but they are
in peace
and though in the sight of men they suffered torments their hope
is full of immortality
afflicted in few things in many they shall be well rewarded
because god hath tried them and found them worthy of himself
as gold in the furnace he hath proved them and as a victim of a
holocaust he hath received them and in time there shall be respect had
to them
the just shall shine and shall run to and fro like sparks among
the reeds
they shall judge nations and rule over people and their lord
shall reign for ever
they that trust in him shall understand the truth and they that
are faithful in love shall rest in him for grace and peace are to his
elect
but the wicked shall be punished according to their own devices
who have neglected the just and have revolted from the lord
for he that rejecteth wisdom and discipline is unhappy and
their hope is vain and their labours without fruit and their works
unprofitable
their wives are foolish and their children wicked
their offspring is cursed for happy is the barren and the
undefiled that hath not known bed in sin she shall have fruit in the
visitation of holy souls
and the eunuch that hath not wrought iniquity with his hands nor
thought wicked things against god for the precious gift of faith shall
be given to him and a most acceptable lot in the temple of god
for the fruit of good labours is glorious and the root of wisdom
never faileth
but the children of adulterers shall not come to perfection and
the seed of the unlawful bed shall be rooted out
and if they live long they shall be nothing regarded and their
last old age shall be without honour
and if they die quickly they shall have no hope nor speech of
comfort in the day of trial
for dreadful are the ends of a wicked race
between the death of the just and the wicked
how beautiful is the chaste generation with glory for the memory
thereof is immortal because it is known both with god and with men
when it is present they imitate it and they desire it when it
hath withdrawn itself and it triumpheth crowned for ever winning the
reward of undefiled conflicts
but the multiplied brood of the wicked shall not thrive and
bastard slips shall not take deep root nor any fast foundation
and if they flourish in branches for a time yet standing not fast
they shall be shaken with the wind and through the force of winds they
shall be rooted out
for the branches not being perfect shall be broken and their
fruits shall be unprofitable and sour to eat and fit for nothing
for the children that are born of unlawful beds are witnesses of
wickedness against their parents in their trial
but the just man if he be prevented with death shall be in rest
for venerable old age is not that of long time nor counted by the
number of years but the understanding of a man is grey hairs
and a spotless life is old age
he pleased god and was beloved and living among sinners he was
translated
he was taken away lest wickedness should alter his understanding
or deceit beguile his soul
for the bewitching of vanity obscureth good things and the
wandering of concupiscence overturneth the innocent mind
being made perfect in a short space he fulfilled a long time
for his soul pleased god therefore he hastened to bring him out
of the midst of iniquities but the people see this and understand not
nor lay up such things in their hearts
that the grace of god and his mercy is with his saints and that
he hath respect to his chosen
but the just that is dead condemneth the wicked that are living
and youth soon ended the long life of the unjust
for they shall see the end of the wise man and shall not
understand what god hath designed for him and why the lord hath set him
in safety
they shall see him and shall despise him but the lord shall
laugh them to scorn
and they shall fall after this without honour and be a reproach
among the dead for ever for he shall burst them puffed up and
speechless and shall shake them from the foundations and they shall be
utterly laid waste they shall be in sorrow and their memory shall
perish
they shall come with fear at the thought of their sins and their
iniquities shall stand against them to convict them
the just
then shall the just stand with great constancy against those that
have afflicted them and taken away their labours
these seeing it shall be troubled with terrible fear and shall be
amazed at the suddenness of their unexpected salvation
saying within themselves repenting and groaning for anguish of
spirit these are they whom we had sometime in derision and for a
parable of reproach
we fools esteemed their life madness and their end without honour
behold how they are numbered among the children of god and their
lot is among the saints
therefore we have erred from the way of truth and the light of
justice hath not shined unto us and the sun of understanding hath not
risen upon us
we wearied ourselves in the way of iniquity and destruction and
have walked through hard ways but the way of the lord we have not
known
what hath pride profited us or what advantage hath the boasting of
riches brought us
all those things are passed away like a shadow and like a post
that runneth on
and as a ship that passeth through the waves whereof when it is
gone by the trace cannot be found nor the path of its keel in the
waters
or as when a bird flieth through the air of the passage of which
no mark can be found but only the sound of the wings beating the light
air and parting it by the force of her flight she moved her wings and
hath flown through and there is no mark found afterwards of her way
or as when an arrow is shot at a mark the divided air quickly
cometh together again so that the passage thereof is not known
so we also being born forthwith ceased to be and have been able
to shew no mark of virtue but are consumed in our wickedness
such things as these the sinners said in hell
for the hope of the wicked is as dust which is blown away with
the wind and as a thin froth which is dispersed by the storm and a
smoke that is scattered abroad by the wind and as the remembrance of a
guest of one day that passeth by
but the just shall live for evermore and their reward is with the
therefore shall they receive a kingdom of glory and a crown of
beauty at the hand of the lord for with his right hand he will cover
them and with his holy arm he will defend them
and his zeal will take armour and he will arm the creature for
the revenge of his enemies
he will put on justice as a breastplate and will take true
judgment instead of a helmet
he will take equity for an invincible shield
and he will sharpen his severe wrath for a spear and the whole
world shall fight with him against the unwise
then shafts of lightning shall go directly from the clouds as
from a bow well bent they shall be shot out and shall fly to the mark
and thick hail shall be cast upon them from the stone casting
wrath the water of the sea shall rage against them and the rivers
shall run together in a terrible manner
a mighty wind shall stand up against them and as a whirlwind
shall divide them and their iniquity shall bring all the earth to a
desert and wickedness shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty
that seek her
wisdom is better than strength and a wise man is better than a
strong man
hear therefore ye kings and understand learn ye that are judges
of the ends of the earth
give ear you that rule the people and that please yourselves in
multitudes of nations
for power is given you by the lord and strength by the most high
who will examine your works and search out your thoughts
because being ministers of his kingdom you have not judged
rightly nor kept the law of justice nor walked according to the will
of god
horribly and speedily will he appear to you for a most severe
judgment shall be for them that bear rule
for to him that is little mercy is granted but the mighty shall
be mightily tormented
for god will not except any mans person neither will he stand in
awe of any mans greatness for he made the little and the great and he
hath equally care of all
but a greater punishment is ready for the more mighty
to you therefore o kings are these my words that you may learn
wisdom and not fall from it
for they that have kept just things justly shall be justified
and they that have learned these things shall find what to answer
covet ye therefore my words and love them and you shall have
instruction
wisdom is glorious and never fadeth away and is easily seen by
them that love her and is found by them that seek her
she preventeth them that covet her so that she first sheweth
herself unto them
he that awaketh early to seek her shall not labour for he shall
find her sitting at his door
to think therefore upon her is perfect understanding and he
that watcheth for her shall quickly be secure
for she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her and she
sheweth herself to them cheerfully in the ways and meeteth them with
all providence
for the beginning of her is the most true desire of discipline
and the care of discipline is love and love is the keeping of her
laws and the keeping of her laws is the firm foundation of
incorruption
and incorruption bringeth near to god
therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to the everlasting
kingdom
if then your delight be in thrones and sceptres o ye kings of
the people love wisdom that you may reign for ever
love the light of wisdom all ye that bear rule over peoples
now what wisdom is and what was her origin i will declare and i
will not hide from you the mysteries of god but will seek her out from
the beginning of her birth and bring the knowledge of her to light and
will not pass over the truth
neither will i go with consuming envy for such a man shall not be
partaker of wisdom
now the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the whole world
and a wise king is the upholding of the people
receive therefore instruction by my words and it shall be
profitable to you
i myself am a mortal man like all others and of the race of him
that was first made of the earth and in the womb of my mother i was
fashioned to be flesh
in the time of ten months i was compacted in blood of the seed of
man and the pleasure of sleep concurring
and being born i drew in the common air and fell upon the earth
that is made alike and the first voice which i uttered was crying as
all others do
i was nursed in swaddling clothes and with great cares
for none of the kings had any other beginning of birth
for all men have one entrance into life and the like going out
wherefore i wished and understanding was given me and i called
upon god and the spirit of wisdom came upon me
and i preferred her before kingdoms and thrones and esteemed
riches nothing in comparison of her
neither did i compare unto her any precious stone for all gold in
comparison of her is as a little sand and silver in respect to her
shall be counted as clay
i loved her above health and beauty and chose to have her instead
of light for her light cannot be put out
now all good things came to me together with her and innumerable
riches through her hands
and i rejoiced in all these for this wisdom went before me and i
knew not that she was the mother of them all
which i have learned without guile and communicate without envy
and her riches i hide not
for she is an infinite treasure to men which they that use
become the friends of god being commended for the gifts of discipline
and god hath given to me to speak as i would and to conceive
thoughts worthy of those things that are given me because he is the
guide of wisdom and the director of the wise
for in his hand are both we and our words and all wisdom and
the knowledge and skill of works
for he hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are to
know the disposition of the whole world and the virtues of the
elements
the beginning and ending and midst of the times the alterations
of their courses and the changes of seasons
the revolutions of the year and the dispositions of the stars
the natures of living creatures and rage of wild beasts the
force of winds and reasonings of men the diversities of plants and
the virtues of roots
and all such things as are hid and not foreseen i have learned
for wisdom which is the worker of all things taught me
for in her is the spirit of understanding holy one manifold
subtile eloquent active undefiled sure sweet loving that which is
good quick which nothing hindereth beneficent
gentle kind steadfast assured secure having all power
overseeing all things and containing all spirits intelligible pure
subtile
for wisdom is more active than all active things and reacheth
everywhere by reason of her purity
for she is a vapour of the power of god and a certain pure
emmanation of the glory of the almighty god and therefore no defiled
thing cometh into her
for she is the brightness of eternal light and the unspotted
mirror of gods majesty and the image of his goodness
and being but one she can do all things and remaining in herself
the same she reneweth all things and through nations conveyeth herself
into holy souls she maketh the friends of god and prophets
for god loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom
for she is more beautiful than the sun and above all the order of
the stars being compared with the light she is found before it
for after this cometh night but no evil can overcome wisdom
she reacheth therefore from end to end mightily and ordereth all
things sweetly
her have i loved and have sought her out from my youth and have
desired to take for my spouse and i became a lover of her beauty
she glorifieth her nobility by being conversant with god yea and
the lord of all things hath loved her
for it is she that teacheth the knowledge of god and is the chooser
of his works
and if riches be desired in life what is richer than wisdom which
maketh all things
and if sense do work who is a more artful worker than she of those
things that are
and if a man love justice her labours have great virtues for she
teacheth temperance and prudence and justice and fortitude which are
such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life
and if a man desire much knowledge she knoweth things past and
judgeth of things to come she knoweth the subtilties of speeches and
the solutions of arguments she knoweth signs and wonders before they be
done and the events of times and ages
i purposed therefore to take her to me to live with me knowing
that she will communicate to me of her good things and will be a
comfort in my cares and grief
for her sake i shall have glory among the multitude and honour
with the ancients though i be young
and i shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment and shall be
admired in the sight of the mighty and the faces of princes shall
wonder at me
they shall wait for me when i hold my peace and they shall look
upon me when i speak and if i talk much they shall lay their hands on
their mouth
moreover by the means of her i shall have immortality and shall
leave behind me an everlasting memory to them that come after me
i shall set the people in order and nations shall be subject to
me
terrible kings hearing shall be afraid of me among the multitude
when i go into my house i shall repose myself with her for her
conversation hath no bitterness nor her company any tediousness but
joy and gladness
thinking these things with myself and pondering them in my heart
that to be allied to wisdom is immortality
and that there is great delight in her friendship and
inexhaustible riches in the works of her hands and in the exercise of
conference with her wisdom and glory in the communication of her
words i went about seeking that i might take her to myself
and i was a witty child and had received a good soul
and whereas i was more good i came to a body undefiled
and as i knew that i could not otherwise be continent except god
gave it and this also was a point of wisdom to know whose gift it was
god of my fathers and lord of mercy who hast made all things with
thy word
and by thy wisdom hast appointed man that he should have dominion
over the creature that was made by thee
that he should order the world according to equity and justice and
execute justice with an upright heart
give me wisdom that sitteth by thy throne and cast me not off
from among thy children
for i am thy servant and the son of thy handmaid a weak man and
of short time and falling short of the understanding of judgment and
laws
for if one be perfect among the children of men yet if thy wisdom
be not with him he shall be nothing regarded
thou hast chosen me to be king of thy people and a judge of thy
sons and daughters
and hast commanded me to build a temple on thy holy mount and an
altar in the city of thy dwelling place a resemblance of thy holy
tabernacle which thou hast prepared from the beginning
and thy wisdom with thee which knoweth thy works which then also
was present when thou madest the world and knew what was agreeable to
thy eyes and what was right in thy commandments
send her out of thy holy heaven and from the throne of thy
majesty that she may be with me and may labour with me that i may
know what is acceptable with thee
for she knoweth and understandeth all things and shall lead me
soberly in my works and shall preserve me by her power
so shall my works be acceptable and i shall govern thy people
justly and shall be worthy of the throne of my father
for who among men is he that can know the counsel of god or who
can think what the will of god is
for the thoughts of mortal men are fearful and our counsels
uncertain
for the corruptible body is a load upon the soul and the earthly
habitation presseth down the mind that museth upon many things
and hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth and
with labour do we find the things that are before us but the things
that are in heaven who shall search out
and who shall know thy thought except thou give wisdom and send
thy holy spirit from above
and so the ways of them that are upon earth may be corrected and
men may learn the things that please thee
for by wisdom they were healed whosoever have pleased thee o
people of israel
she preserved him that was first formed by god the father of the
world when he was created alone
and she brought him out of his sin and gave him power to govern
all things
but when the unjust went away from her in his anger he perished
by the fury wherewith he murdered his brother
for whose cause when water destroyed the earth wisdom healed it
again directing the course of the just by contemptible wood
moreover when the nations had conspired together to consent to
wickedness she knew the just and preserved him without blame to god
and kept him strong against the compassion for his son
him strong etc gave him strength to stand firm against the efforts
of his natural tenderness when he was ordered to sacrifice his son
she delivered the just man who fled from the wicked that were
perishing when the fire came down upon pentapolis
whose land for a testimony of their wickedness is desolate and
smoketh to this day and the trees bear fruits that ripen not and a
standing pillar of salt is a monument of an incredulous soul
for regarding not wisdom they did not only slip in this that
they were ignorant of good things but they left also unto men a
memorial of their folly so that in the things in which they sinned
they could not so much as lie hid
but wisdom hath delivered from sorrow them that attend upon her
she conducted the just when he fled from his brothers wrath
through the right ways and shewed him the kingdom of god and gave him
the knowledge of the holy things made him honourable in his labours
and accomplished his labours
in the deceit of them that overreached him she stood by him and
made him honourable
she kept him safe from his enemies and she defended him from
seducers and gave him a strong conflict that he might overcome and
know that wisdom is mightier than all
she forsook not the just when he was sold but delivered him from
sinners she went down with him into the pit
and in bands she left him not till she brought him the sceptre
of the kingdom and power against those that oppressed him and shewed
them to be liars that had accused him and gave him everlasting glory
she delivered the just people and blameless seed from the
nations that oppressed them
she entered into the soul of the servant of god and stood against
dreadful kings in wonders and signs
and she rendered to the just the wages of their labours and
conducted them in a wonderful way and she was to them for a covert by
day and for the light of stars by night
and she brought them through the red sea and carried them over
through a great water
but their enemies she drowned in the sea and from the depth of
hell she brought them out therefore the just took the spoils of the
wicked
and they sung to thy holy name o lord and they praised with one
accord thy victorious hand
for wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb and made the tongues of
infants eloquent
she prospered their works in the hands of the holy prophet
they went through wildernesses that were not inhabited and in
desert places they pitched their tents
they stood against their enemies and revenged themselves of their
adversaries
they were thirsty and they called upon thee and water was given
them out of the high rock and a refreshment of their thirst out of the
hard stone
for by what things their enemies were punished when their drink
failed them while the children of israel abounded therewith and
rejoiced
to punish the egyptians by thirst when he turned all their waters into
blood at which time the israelites who were exempt from those
plagues had plenty of water wrought another miracle in favour of his
own people in their thirst by giving them water out of the rock
by the same things they in their need were benefited
for instead of a fountain of an ever running river thou gavest
human blood to the unjust
and whilst they were diminished for a manifest reproof of their
murdering the infants thou gavest to thine abundant water unlooked for
shewing by the thirst that was then how thou didst exalt thine
and didst kill their adversaries
for when they were tried and chastised with mercy they knew how
the wicked were judged with wrath and tormented
for thou didst admonish and try them as a father but the others
as a severe king thou didst examine and condemn
for whether absent or present they were tormented alike
for a double affliction came upon them and a groaning for the
remembrance of things past
for when they heard that by their punishments the others were
benefited they remembered the lord wondering at the end of what was
come to pass
benefited and miraculously favoured in the same kind in which they had
been punished
for whom they scorned before when he was thrown out at the time
of his being wickedly exposed to perish him they admired in the end
when they saw the event their thirsting being unlike to that of the
just
but for the foolish devices of their iniquity because some being
deceived worshipped dumb serpents and worthless beasts thou didst send
upon them a multitude of dumb beasts for vengeance
that they might know that by what things a man sinneth by the
same also he is tormented
for thy almighty hand which made the world of matter without
form was not unable to send upon them a multitude of bears or fierce
lions
or unknown beasts of a new kind full of rage either breathing
out a fiery vapour or sending forth a stinking smoke or shooting
horrible sparks out of their eyes
whereof not only the hurt might be able to destroy them but also
the very sight might kill them through fear
yea and without these they might have been slain with one
blast persecuted by their own deeds and scattered by the breath of thy
power but thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and
weight
for great power always belonged to thee alone and who shall
resist the strength of thy arm
for the whole world before thee is as the least grain of the
balance and as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon tho
earth
but thou hast mercy upon all because thou canst do all things
and overlookest the sins of men for the sake of repentance
for thou lovest all things that are and hatest none of the
things which thou hast made for thou didst not appoint or make any
thing hating it
and how could any thing endure if thou wouldst not or be
preserved if not called by thee
but thou sparest all because they are thine o lord who lovest
souls
o how good and sweet is thy spirit o lord in all things
and therefore thou chastisest them that err by little and little
and admonishest them and speakest to them concerning the things
wherein they offend that leaving their wickedness they may believe in
thee o lord
for those ancient inhabitants of thy holy land whom thou didst
abhor
because they did works hateful to thee by their sorceries and
wicked sacrifices
and those merciless murderers of their own children and eaters of
mens bowels and devourers of blood from the midst of thy consecration
land sacred to thee in which thy temple was to be established and
mans redemption to be wrought
and those parents sacrificing with their own hands helpless souls
it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our parents
that the land which of all is most dear to thee might receive a
worthy colony of the children of god
yet even those thou sparedst as men and didst send wasps
forerunners of thy host to destroy them by little and little
not that thou wast unable to bring the wicked under the just by
war or by cruel beasts or with one rough word to destroy them at once
but executing thy judgments by degrees thou gavest them place of
repentance not being ignorant that they were a wicked generation and
their malice natural and that their thought could never be changed
for it was a cursed seed from the beginning neither didst thou
for fear of any one give pardon to their sins
for who shall say to thee what hast thou done or who shall
withstand thy judgment or who shall come before thee to be a revenger
of wicked men or who shall accuse thee if the nations perish which
thou hast made
for there is no other god but thou who hast care of all that
thou shouldst shew that thou dost not give judgment unjustly
neither shall king nor tyrant in thy sight inquire about them
whom thou hast destroyed
for so much then as thou art just thou orderest all things
justly thinking it not agreeable to the power to condemn him who
deserveth not to be punished
for thy power is the beginning of justice and because thou art
for thou shewest thy power when men will not believe thee to be
absolute in power and thou convincest the boldness of them that know
thee not
but thou being master of power judgest with tranquillity and
with great favour disposest of us for thy power is at hand when thou
wilt
but thou hast taught thy people by such works that they must be
just and humane and hast made thy children to be of a good hope
because in judging thou givest place for repentance for sins
for if thou didst punish the enemies of thy servants and that
deserved to die with so great deliberation giving them time and place
whereby they might be changed from their wickedness
with what circumspection hast thou judged thy own children to
whose parents thou hast sworn and made covenants of good promises
therefore whereas thou chastisest us thou scourgest our enemies
very many ways to the end that when we judge we may think on thy
goodness and when we are judged we may hope for thy mercy
wherefore thou hast also greatly tormented them who in their
life have lived foolishly and unjustly by the same things which they
worshipped
for they went astray for a long time in the ways of error
holding those things for gods which are the most worthless among beasts
living after the manner of children without understanding
therefore thou hast sent a judgment upon them as senseless
children to mock them
but they that were not amended by mockeries and reprehensions
experienced the worthy judgment of god
for seeing with indignation that they suffered by those very
things which they took for gods when they were destroyed by the same
they acknowledged him the true god whom in time past they denied that
they knew for which cause the end also of their condemnation came upon
them
the works of the hands of men
but all men are vain in whom there is not the knowledge of god
and who by these good things that are seen could not understand him
that is neither by attending to the works have acknowledged who was the
workman
but have imagined either the fire or the wind or the swift air
or the circle of the stars or the great water or the sun and moon to
be the gods that rule the world
with whose beauty if they being delighted took them to be gods
let them know how much the lord of them is more beautiful than they for
the first author of beauty made all those things
or if they admired their power and their effects let them
understand by them that he that made them is mightier than they
for by the greatness of the beauty and of the creature the
creator of them may be seen so as to be known thereby
but yet as to these they are less to be blamed for they perhaps
err seeking god and desirous to find him
for being conversant among his works they search and they are
persuaded that the things are good which are seen
but then again they are not to be pardoned
for if they were able to know so much as to make a judgment of the
world how did they not more easily find out the lord thereof
but unhappy are they and their hope is among the dead who have
called gods the works of the hand of men gold and silver the
inventions of art and the resemblances of beasts or an unprofitable
stone the work of an ancient hand
or if an artist a carpenter hath cut down a tree proper for his
use in the wood and skilfully taken off all the bark thereof and with
his art diligently formeth a vessel profitable for the common uses of
life
and useth the chips of his work to dress his meat
and taking what was left thereof which is good for nothing
being a crooked piece of wood and full of knots carveth it diligently
when he hath nothing else to do and by the skill of his art fashioneth
it and maketh it like the image of a man
or the resemblance of some beast laying it over with vermilion
and painting it red and covering every spot that is in it
and maketh a convenient dwelling place for it and setting it in
a wall and fastening it with iron
providing for it lest it should fall knowing that it is unable
to help itself for it is an image and hath need of help
and then maketh prayer to it enquiring concerning his substance
and his children or his marriage and he is not ashamed to speak to
that which hath no life
and for health he maketh supplication to the weak and for life
prayeth to that which is dead and for help calleth upon that which is
unprofitable
and for a good journey he petitioneth him that cannot walk and
for getting and for working and for the event of all things he asketh
him that is unable to do any thing
again another designing to sail and beginning to make his voyage
through the raging waves calleth upon a piece of wood more frail than
the wood that carrieth him
for this the desire of gain devised and the workman built it by
his skill
but thy providence o father governeth it for thou hast made a
way even in the sea and a most sure path among the waves
shewing that thou art able to save out of all things yea though
a man went to sea without art
but that the works of thy wisdom might not be idle therefore men
also trust their lives even to a little wood and passing over the sea
by ship are saved
and from the beginning also when the proud giants perished the
hope of the world fleeing to a vessel which was governed by thy hand
left to the world seed of generation
for blessed is the wood by which justice cometh
but the idol that is made by hands is cursed as well it as he
that made it he because he made it and it because being frail it is
called a god
but to god the wicked and his wickedness are hateful alike
for that which is made together with him that made it shall
suffer torments
therefore there shall be no respect had even to the idols of the
a temptation to the souls of men and a snare to the feet of the unwise
for the beginning of fornication is the devising of idols and
the invention of them is the corruption of life
for neither were they from the beginning neither shall they be
for ever
for by the vanity of men they came into the world and therefore
they shall be found to come shortly to an end
for a father being afflicted with bitter grief made to himself
the image of his son who was quickly taken away and him who then had
died as a man he began now to worship as a god and appointed him rites
and sacrifices among his servants
then in process of time wicked custom prevailing this error
was kept as a law and statues were worshipped by the commandment of
tyrants
and those whom men could not honour in presence because they
dwelt far off they brought their resemblance from afar and made an
express image of the king whom they had a mind to honour that by this
their diligence they might honour as present him that was absent
and to the worshipping of these the singular diligence also of
the artificer helped to set forward the ignorant
for he being willing to please him that employed him laboured
with all his art to make the resemblance in the best manner
and the multitude of men carried away by the beauty of the work
took him now for a god that little before was but honoured as a man
and this was the occasion of deceiving human life for men
serving either their affection or their kings gave the incommunicable
name to stones and wood
and it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of god
but whereas they lived in a great war of ignorance they call so many
and so great evils peace
for either they sacrifice their own children or use hidden
sacrifices or keep watches full of madness
so that now they neither keep life nor marriage undefiled but
one killeth another through envy or grieveth him by adultery
and all things are mingled together blood murder theft and
dissimulation corruption and unfaithfulness tumults and perjury
disquieting of the good
forgetfulness of god defiling of souls changing of nature
disorder in marriage and the irregularity of adultery and uncleanness
for the worship of abominable idols is the cause and the
beginning and end of all evil
for either they are mad when they are merry or they prophesy
lies or they live unjustly or easily forswear themselves
for whilst they trust in idols which are without life though
they swear amiss they look not to be hurt
but for both these things they shall be justly punished because
they have thought not well of god giving heed to idols and have sworn
unjustly in guile despising justice
for it is not the power of them by whom they swear but the just
vengeance of sinners always punisheth the transgression of the unjust
condemning both the makers and the worshippers of idols
but thou our god art gracious and true patient and ordering
all things in mercy
for if we sin we are thine knowing thy greatness and if we sin
not we know that we are counted with thee
for to know thee is perfect justice and to know thy justice and
thy power is the root of immortality
for the invention of mischievous men hath not deceived us nor the
shadow of a picture a fruitless labour a graven figure with divers
colours
the sight whereof enticeth the fool to lust after it and he
loveth the lifeless figure of a dead image
the lovers of evil things deserve to have no better things to
trust in both they that make them and they that love them and they
that worship them
the potter also tempering soft earth with labour fashioneth every
vessel for our service and of the same clay he maketh both vessels that
are for clean uses and likewise such as serve to the contrary but what
is the use of these vessels the potter is the judge
and of the same clay by a vain labour he maketh a god he who a
little before was made of earth himself and a little after returneth to
the same out of which he was taken when his life which was lent him
shall be called for again
but his care is not that he shall labour nor that his life is
short but he striveth with the goldsmiths and silversmiths and he
endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass and counteth it a glory to
make vain things
for his heart is ashes and his hope vain earth and his life more
base than clay
forasmuch as he knew not his maker and him that inspired into
him the soul that worketh and that breathed into him a living spirit
yea and they have counted our life a pastime and the business of
life to be gain and that we must be getting every way even out of
evil
for that man knoweth that he offendeth above all others who of
earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven gods
but all the enemies of thy people that hold them in subjection
are foolish and unhappy and proud beyond measure
for they have esteemed all the idols of the heathens for gods
which neither have the use of eyes to see nor noses to draw breath nor
ears to hear nor fingers of hands to handle and as for their feet
they are slow to walk
for man made them and he that borroweth his own breath
fashioned them for no man can make a god like to himself
for being mortal himself he formeth a dead thing with his wicked
hands for he is better than they whom he worshippeth because he indeed
hath lived though he were mortal but they never
moreover they worship also the vilest creatures but things
without sense compared to these are worse than they
yea neither by sight can any man see good of these beasts but
they have fled from the praise of god and from his blessing
for these things and by the like things to these they were
worthily punished and were destroyed by a multitude of beasts
instead of which punishment dealing well with thy people thou
gavest them their desire of delicious food of a new taste preparing
for them quails for their meat
to the end that they indeed desiring food by means of those
things that were shewn and sent among them might loath even that which
was necessary to satisfy their desire but these after suffering want
for a short time tasted a new meat
restrained even from that food which was necessary by the frogs and the
flies that were sent amongst them and spoiled all their meatsibid
for it was requisite that inevitable destruction should come upon
them that exercised tyranny but to these it should only be shewn how
their enemies were destroyed
for when the fierce rage of beasts came upon these they were
destroyed by the bitings of crooked serpents
but thy wrath endured not for ever but they were troubled for a
short time for their correction having a sign of salvation to put them
in remembrance of the commandment of thy law
for he that turned to it was not healed by that which he saw but
by thee the saviour of all
and in this thou didst shew to our enemies that thou art he who
deliverest from all evil
for the bitings of locusts and of flies killed them and there
was found no remedy for their life because they were worthy to be
destroyed by such things
but not even the teeth of venomous serpents overcame thy
children for thy mercy came and healed them
for they were examined for the remembrance of thy words and were
quickly healed lest falling into deep forgetfulness they might not be
able to use thy help
for it was neither herb nor mollifying plaster that healed
them but thy word o lord which healeth all things
for it is thou o lord that hast power of life and death and
leadest down to the gates of death and bringest back again
a man indeed killeth through malice and when the spirit is gone
forth it shall not return neither shall he call back the soul that is
received
but it is impossible to escape thy hand
for the wicked that denied to know thee were scourged by the
strength of thy arm being persecuted by strange waters and hail and
rain and consumed by fire
and which was wonderful in water which extinguisheth all
things the fire had more force for the world fighteth for the just
laid waste the land of egypt ex
for at one time the fire was mitigated that the beasts which
were sent against the wicked might not be burnt but that they might
see and perceive that they were persecuted by the judgment of god
and at another time the fire above its own power burnt in the
midst of water to destroy the fruits of a wicked land
instead of which things thou didst feed thy people with the food
of angels and gavest them bread from heaven prepared without labour
having in it all that is delicious and the sweetness of every taste
for thy sustenance shewed thy sweetness to thy children and
serving every mans will it was turned to what every man liked
but snow and ice endured the force of fire and melted not that
they might know that the fire burning in the hail and flashing in the
rain destroyed the fruits of the enemies
but this same again that the just might be nourished did even
forget its own strength
for the creature serving thee the creator is made fierce
against the unjust for their punishment and abateth its strength for
the benefit of them that trust in thee
therefore even then it was transformed into all things and was
obedient to thy grace that nourisheth all according to the will of
them that desired it of thee
that thy children o lord whom thou lovedst might know that it
is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth men but thy word
preserveth them that believe in thee
for that which could not be destroyed by fire being warmed with
a little sunbeam presently melted away
that it might be known to all that we ought to prevent the sun
to bless thee and adore thee at the dawning of the light
for the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winters
ice and shall run off as unprofitable water
for thy judgments o lord are great and thy words cannot be
expressed therefore undisciplined souls have erred
for while the wicked thought to be able to have dominion over the
holy nation they themselves being fettered with the bonds of darkness
and a long night shut up in their houses lay there exiled from the
eternal providence
and while they thought to lie hid in their obscure sins they were
scattered under a dark veil of forgetfullness being horribly afraid
and troubled with exceeding great astonishment
for neither did the den that held them keep them from fear for
noises coming down troubled them and sad visions appearing to them
affrighted them
and no power of fire could give them light neither could the
bright flames of the stars enlighten that horrible night
but there appeared to them a sudden fire very dreadful and being
struck with the fear of that face which was not seen they thought the
things which they saw to be worse
and the delusions of their magic art were put down and their
boasting of wisdom was reproachfully rebuked
for they who promised to drive away fears and troubles from a sick
soul were sick themselves of a fear worthy to be laughed at
for though no terrible thing disturbed them yet being scared with
the passing by of beasts and hissing of serpents they died for fear
and denying that they saw the air which could by no means be avoided
for whereas wickedness is fearful it beareth witness of its
condemnation for a troubled conscience always forecasteth grievous
things
for fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from
thought
and while there is less expectation from within the greater doth
it count the ignorance of that cause which bringeth the torment
but they that during that night in which nothing could be done
and which came upon them from the lowest and deepest hell slept the
same sleep
were sometimes molested with the fear of monsters sometimes
fainted away their soul failing them for a sudden and unlooked for
fear was come upon them
moreover if any of them had fallen down he was kept shut up in
prison without irons
for if any one were a husbandman or a shepherd or a labourer in
the field and was suddenly overtaken he endured a necessity from which
he could not fly
for they were all bound together with one chain of darkness
the spreading branches of trees or a fall of water running down with
violence
or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down or the running that
could not be seen of beasts playing together or the roaring voice of
wild beasts or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains these
things made them to swoon for fear
for the whole world was enlightened with a clear light and none
were hindered in their labours
but over them only was spread a heavy night an image of that
darkness which was to come upon them but they were to themselves more
grievous than the darkness
intercession in the sedition on occasion of core
but thy saints had a very great light and they heard their voice
indeed but did not see their shape and because they also did not
suffer the same things they glorified thee
and they that before had been wronged gave thanks because they
were not hurt now and asked this gift that there might be a
difference
therefore they received a burning pillar of fire for a guide of
the way which they knew not and thou gavest them a harmless sun of a
good entertainment
should be an agreeable guest to them
the others indeed were worthy to be deprived of light and
imprisoned in darkness who kept thy children shut up by whom the pure
light of the law was to be given to the world
and whereas they thought to kill the babes of the just one child
being cast forth and saved to reprove them thou tookest away a
multitude of their children and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty
water
for that night was known before by our fathers that assuredly
knowing what oaths they had trusted to they might be of better courage
so thy people received the salvation of the just and destruction
of the unjust
for as thou didst punish the adversaries so thou didst also
encourage and glorify us
for the just children of good men were offering sacrifice
secretly and they unanimously ordered a law of justice that the just
should receive both good and evil alike singing now the praises of the
fathers
offered in private the sacrifice of the paschal lamb and were
regulating what they were to do in their journey when that last and
most dreadful plague was coming upon their enemies
but on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the
enemies and a lamentable mourning was heard for the children that were
bewailed
and the servant suffered the same punishment as the master and a
common man suffered in like manner as the king
so all alike had innumerable dead with one kind of death
noblest offspring of them was destroyed
for whereas they would not believe any thing before by reason of
the enchantments then first upon the destruction of the firstborn they
acknowledged the people to be of god
for while all things were in quiet silence and the night was in
the midst of her course
thy almighty word leaped down from heaven from thy royal throne
as a fierce conqueror into the midst of the land of destruction
with a sharp sword carrying thy unfeigned commandment and he
stood and filled all things with death and standing on the earth
reached even to heaven
then suddenly visions of evil dreams troubled them and fears
unlooked for came upon them
and one thrown here another there half dead shewed the cause
of his death
for the visions that troubled them foreshewed these things lest
they should perish and not know why they suffered these evils
but the just also were afterwards touched by an assault of death
and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the wilderness but thy
wrath did not long continue
for a blameless man made haste to pry for the people bringing
forth the shield of his ministry prayer and by incense making
supplication withstood the wrath and put an end to the calamity
shewing that he was thy servant
and he overcame the disturbance not by strength of body nor with
force of arms but with a word he subdued him that punished them
alleging the oath and covenant made with the fathers
for when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon
another he stood between and stayed the assault and cut off the way to
the living
for in the priestly robe which he wore was the whole world and
in the four rows of the stones the glory of the fathers was graven and
thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head
and to these the destroyer gave place and was afraid of them
for the proof only of wrath was enough
punishment of the wicked
but as to the wicked even to the end there came upon them wrath
without mercy for he knew before also what they would do
for when they had given them leave to depart and had sent them
away with great care they repented and pursued after them
for whilst they were yet mourning and lamenting at the graves of
the dead they took up another foolish device and pursued them as
fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone
for a necessity of which they were worthy brought them to this
end and they lost the remembrance of those things which had happened
that their punishment might fill up what was wanting to their torments
and that thy people might wonderfully pass through but they might
find a new death
for every creature according to its kind was fashioned again as
from the beginning obeying thy commandments that thy children might be
kept without hurt
for a cloud overshadowed their camps and where water was before
dry land appeared and in the red sea a way without hindrance and out
of the great deep a springing field
through which all the nation passed which was protected with thy
hand seeing thy miracles and wonders
for they fed on their food like horses and they skipped like
lambs praising thee o lord who hadst delivered them
for they were yet mindful of those things which had been done in
the time of their sojourning how the ground brought forth flies instead
of cattle and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of
fishes
and at length they saw a new generation of birds when being led
by their appetite they asked for delicate meats
for to satisfy their desire the quail came up to them from the
sea and punishments came upon the sinners not without foregoing signs
by the force of thunders for they suffered justly according to their
own wickedness
for they exercised a more detestable inhospitality than any
others indeed received not strangers unknown to them but these brought
their guests into bondage that had deserved well of them
and not only so but in another respect also they were worse for
the others against their will received the strangers
but these grievously afflicted them whom they had received with
joy and who lived under the same laws
but they were struck with blindness as those others were at the
doors of the just man when they were covered with sudden darkness and
every one sought the passage of his own door
for while the elements are changed in themselves as in an
instrument the sound of the quality is changed yet all keep their
sound which may clearly be perceived by the very sight
wrought in the elements by miracles in favour of his people they still
kept their harmony by obeying his will
for the things of the land were turned into things of the water
and the things that before swam in the water passed upon the land
the fire had power in water above its own virtue and the water
forgot its quenching nature
on the other side the flames wasted not the flesh of corruptible
animals walking therein neither did they melt that good food which was
apt to melt as ice for in all things thou didst magnify thy people o
assist them at all times and in every place
because like an excellent preacher it gives admirable lessons of all
virtues the author was jesus the son of sirach of jerusalem who
flourished about two hundred years before christ as it was written
after the time of esdras it is not in the jewish canon but is received
as canonical and divine by the catholic church instructed by
apostolical tradition and directed by the spirit of god it was first
written in the hebrew but afterwards translated into greek by another
following
and the prophets and others that have followed them for which things
that speak must needs be skilful but strangers also both speaking and
writing may by their means become most learned my grandfather jesus
after he had much given himself to a diligent reading of the law and
the prophets and other books that were delivered to us from our
fathers had a mind also to write something himself pertaining to
doctrine and wisdom that such as are desirous to learn and are made
knowing in these things may be more and more attentive in mind and be
strengthened to live according to the law i entreat you therefore to
come with benevolence and to read with attention and to pardon us for
those things wherein we may seem while we follow the image of wisdom
to come short in the composition of words for the hebrew words have not
the same force in them when translated into another tongue and not only
these but the law also itself and the prophets and the rest of the
books have no small difference when they are spoken in their own
language for in the eight and thirtieth year coming into egypt when
there books left of no small nor contemptible learning therefore i
thought it good and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and
labour to interpret this book and with much watching and study in some
space of time i brought the book to an end and set it forth for the
service of them that are willing to apply their mind and to learn how
they ought to conduct themselves who purpose to lead their life
according to the law of the lord
