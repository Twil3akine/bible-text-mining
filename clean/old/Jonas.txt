riseth of which he being found by lot to be the cause is cast into
the sea which thereupon is calmed
now the word of the lord came to jonas the son of amathi saying
arise and go to ninive the great city and preach in it for the
wickedness thereof is come up before me
and jonas rose up to flee into tharsis from the face of the lord
and he went down to joppe and found a ship going to tharsis and he
paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them to tharsis
from the face of the lord
but the lord sent a great wind to the sea and a great tempest was
raised in the sea and the ship was in danger to be broken
and the mariners were afraid and the men cried to their god and
they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to
lighten it of them and jonas went down into the inner part of the ship
and fell into a deep sleep
fleeing from god and threatened on every side with his judgments and
yet sleeping as if they were secure
and the ship master came to him and said to him why art thou fast
asleep rise up call upon thy god if so be that god will think of us
that we may not perish
and they said every one to his fellow come and let us cast lots
that we may know why this evil is upon us and they cast lots and the
lot fell upon jonas
and they said to him tell us for what cause this evil is upon us
what is thy business of what country art thou and whither goest thou
or of what people art thou
and he said to them i am a hebrew and i fear the lord and the
and the men were greatly afraid and they said to him why hast
thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the face of the
and they said to him what shall we do with thee that the sea may
be calm to us for the sea flowed and swelled
and he said to them take me up and cast me into the sea and the
sea shall be calm to you for i know for my sake this great tempest is
upon you
and the men rowed hard to return the land but they were not able
because the sea tossed and swelled upon them
and they cried to the lord and said we beseech thee o lord let
us not perish for this mans life and lay not upon us innocent blood
for thou oh lord hast done as it pleased thee
and they took jonas and cast him into the sea and the sea ceased
from raging
and the men feared the lord exceedingly and sacrificed victims to
the lord and made vows
now the lord prepared a great fish to swallow up jonas and jonas
was in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights
and jonas prayed to the lord his god out of the belly of the
fish
and he said i cried out of my affliction to the lord and he heard
me i cried out of the belly of hell and thou hast heard my voice
and thou hast cast me forth into the deep in the heart of the sea
and a flood hast compassed me all thy billows and thy waves have
passed over me
and i said i am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes but yet i
shall see the holy temple again
the waters compassed me about even to the soul the deep hath
closed me round about the sea hath covered my head
i went down to the lowest parts of the mountains the bars of the
earth have shut me up for ever and thou wilt bring up my life from
corruption o lord my god
when my soul was in distress within me i remembered the lord that
my prayer may come to thee unto the holy temple
they that in vain observe vanities forsake their own mercy
but i with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee i will pay
whatsoever i have vowed for my salvation to the lord
and the lord spoke to the fish and it vomited out jonas upon the
dry land
his will which all things obey
repentance god recalleth the sentence by which they were to be
destroyed
and the word of the lord came to jonas the second time saying
arise and go to ninive the great city and preach in it the
preaching that i bid thee
and jonas arose and went to ninive according to the word of the
streets and public places was three days journey
and jonas began to enter into the city one days journey and he
cried and said yet forty days and ninive shall be destroyed
and the men of ninive believed in god and they proclaimed a fast
and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least
and the word came to the king of ninive and he rose up out of his
throne and cast away his robe from him and was clothed in sackcloth
and sat in ashes
and he caused it to be proclaimed and published in ninive from the
mouth of the king and of his princes saying let neither men nor
beasts oxen nor sheep taste anything let them not feed nor drink
water
and let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth and cry to the
way and from the iniquity that is in their hands
who can tell if god will turn and forgive and will turn away from
his fierce anger and we shall not perish
and god saw their works that they were turned from their evil
way and god had mercy with regard to the evil which he had said that he
would do to them and he did it not
and jonas was exceedingly troubled and was angry
a false prophet or rather lest gods word by this occasion might
come to be slighted and disbelieved
and he prayed to the lord and said i beseech thee o lord is not
this what i said when i was yet in my own country therefore i went
before to flee into tharsis for i know that thou art a gracious and
merciful god patient and of much compassion and easy to forgive evil
and now o lord i beseech thee take my life from me for it is
better for me to die than to live
and the lord said dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry
then jonas went out of the city and sat toward the east side of
the city and he made himself a booth there and he sat under it in the
shadow till he might see what would befall the city
and the lord god prepared an ivy and it came up over the head of
fatigued and jonas was exceeding glad of the ivy
which some render a gourd others a palmerist or palma christi
but god prepared a worm when the morning arose on the following
day and it struck the ivy and it withered
and when the sun was risen the lord commanded a hot and burning
wind and the sun beat upon the head of jonas and he broiled with the
heat and he desired for his soul that he might die and said it is
better for me to die than to live
and the lord said to jonas dost thou think thou hast reason to be
angry for the ivy and he said i am angry with reason even unto death
and the lord said thou art grieved for the ivy for which thou
hast not laboured nor made it to grow which in one night came up and
in one night perished
and shall i not spare ninive that great city in which there are
more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that know not how to
distinguish between their right hand and their left and many beasts
contemporary with the prophet isaias whom he resembles both in his
spirit and his style he is different from the prophet micheas mentioned
in the third book of kings chap for that micheas lived in the days
of king achab one hundred and fifty years before the time of ezechias
under whom this micheas prophesied
