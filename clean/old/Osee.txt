forth the crimes of israel and their punishment he foretells their
redemption by christ
the word of the lord that came to osee the son of beeri in the
days of ozias joathan achaz and ezechias kings of juda and in the
days of jeroboam the son of joas king of israel
the beginning of the lords speaking by osee and the lord said to
fornications for the land by fornication shall depart from the lord
fornication this was to represent the lords proceedings with his
people israel who by spiritual fornication were continually offending
himibid children of fornications so called from the character of
their mother if not also from their own wicked dispositions
so he went and took gomer the daughter of debelaim and she
conceived and bore him a son
and the lord said to him call his name jezrahel for yet a little
while and i will visit the blood of jezrahel upon the house of jehu
and i will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel
and in that day i will break in pieces the bow of israel in the
valley of jezrahel
and she conceived again and bore a daughter and he said to him
on the house of israel but i will utterly forget them
and i will have mercy on the house of juda and i will save them by
the lord their god and i will not save them by bow nor by sword nor
by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen
and she weaned her that was called without mercy and she
conceived and bore a son
and he said call his name not my people for you are not my
people and i will not be yours
and the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand of
the sea that is without measure and shall not be numbered and it
shall be in the place where it shall be said to them you are not my
people it shall be said to them ye are the sons of the living god
church of christ
and the children of juda and the children of israel shall be
gathered together and they shall appoint themselves one head and shall
come up out of the land for great is the day of jezrahel
of the seed of god for jezrahel signifies the seed of god
church of christ
say ye to your brethren you are my people and to your sister
sister her that hath obtained mercy this is connected with the latter
end of the foregoing chapter and relates to the converts of israel
judge your mother judge her because she is not my wife and i am
not her husband let her put away her fornications from her face and
her adulteries from between her breasts
lest i strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was
born and i will make her as a wilderness and will set her as a land
that none can pass through and will kill her with drought
and i will not have mercy on her children for they are the
children of fornications
for their mother hath committed fornication she that conceived
them is covered with shame for she said i will go after my lovers
that give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax my oil and
my drink
wherefore behold i will hedge up thy way with thorns and i will
stop it up with a wall and she shall not find her paths
and she shall follow after her lovers and shall not overtake them
and she shall seek them and shall not find and she shall say i will
go and return to my first husband because it was better with me then
than now
and she did not know that i gave her corn and wine and oil and
multiplied her silver and gold which they have used in the service of
therefore will i return and take away my corn in its season and
my wine in its season and i will set at liberty my wool and my flax
which covered her disgrace
and now i will lay open her folly in the eyes of her lovers and
no man shall deliver her out of my hand
and i will cause all her mirth to cease her solemnities her new
moons her sabbaths and all her festival times
and i will destroy her vines and her fig trees of which she
said these are my rewards which my lovers have given me and i will
make her as a forest and the beasts of the field shall devour her
and i will visit upon her the days of baalim to whom she burnt
incense and decked herself out with her earrings and with her jewels
and went after her lovers and forgot me saith the lord
therefore behold i will allure her and will lead her into the
wilderness and i will speak to her heart
allure her by my grace etc and send her vinedressers viz the
apostles originally her own children who shall open to her the gates
of hope as heretofore at her coming into the land of promise she had
all good success after she had satisfied the divine justice by the
execution of achan in the valley of achor jos
and i will give her vinedressers out of the same place and the
valley of achor for an opening of hope and she shall sing there
according to the days of her youth and according to the days of her
coming up out of the land of egypt
and it shall be in that day saith the lord that she shall call
me my husband and she shall call me no more banli
is that whereas ishi and baali were used indifferently in those days by
wives speaking to their husbands the synagogue whom god was pleased to
consider as his spouse should call him only ishi and abstain from the
name of baali because of its affinity with the idol baal
and i will take away the names of baalim out of her mouth and she
shall no more remember their name
of baal
and in that day i will make a covenant with them with the beasts
of the field and with the fowls of the air and with the creeping
things of the earth and i will destroy the bow and the sword and war
out of the land and i will make them sleep secure
and i will espouse thee to me for ever and i will espouse thee to
me in justice and judgment and in mercy and in commiserations
and i will espouse thee to me in faith and thou shalt know that i
am the lord
and it shall come to pass in that day i will hear saith the
which in the following verse is called jezrahel that is the seed of
and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and
these shall hear jezrahel
and i will sow her unto me in the earth and i will have mercy on
her that was without mercy
and i will say to that which is not my people thou art my people
and they shall say thou art my god
the gentiles
love to the synagogue the wretched state of the jews for a long time
till at last they shall be converted
and the lord said to me go yet again and love a woman beloved of
her friend and an adulteress as the lord loveth the children of
and i bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and for a core
of barley and for half a core of barley
and i said to her thou shalt wait for me many days thou shalt not
play the harlot and thou shalt be no mans and i also will wait for
thee
for the children of israel shall sit many days without king and
without prince and without sacrifice and without altar and without
ephod and without theraphim
and after this the children of israel shall return and shall seek
the lord their god and david their king and they shall fear the
their example
hear the word of the lord ye children of israel for the lord
shall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land for there is
no truth and there is no mercy and there is no knowledge of god in the
land
cursing and lying and killing and theft and adultery have
overflowed and blood hath touched blood
therefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleth in it
shall languish with the heat of the field and with the fowls of the
air yea the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together
but yet let not any man judge and let not a man be rebuked for
thy people are as they that contradict the priest
strive with them or reprove them they are so obstinate in evil
and thou shalt fall today and the prophet also shall fall with
thee in the night i have made thy mother to be silent
my people have been silent because they had no knowledge because
thou hast rejected knowledge i will reject thee that thou shalt not do
the office of priesthood to me and thou hast forgotten the law of thy
according to the multitude of them so have they sinned against me
they shall eat the sins of my people and shall lift up their souls
to their iniquity
and there shall be like people like priest and i will visit their
ways upon them and i will repay them their devices
and they shall eat and shall not be filled they have committed
fornication and have not ceased because they have forsaken the lord in
not observing the law
fornication and wine and drunkenness take away the
understanding
my people have consulted their stocks and their staff hath
declared unto them for the spirit of fornication hath deceived them
and they have committed fornication against their god
they offered sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burnt
incense upon the hills under the oak and the poplar and the
turpentine tree because the shadow thereof was good therefore shall
your daughters commit fornication and your spouses shall be
adulteresses
i will not visit upon your daughters when they shall commit
fornication and upon your spouses when they shall commit adultery
because themselves conversed with harlots and offered sacrifice with
the effeminate and the people that doth not understand shall be beaten
if thou play the harlot o israel at least let not juda offend
and go ye not into galgal and come not up into bethaven and do not
swear the lord liveth
signifies the house of god is called by the prophet bethaven that is
the house of vanity from jeroboams golden calf that was worshipped
there
for israel hath gone astray like a wanton heifer now will the lord
feed them as a lamb in a spacious place
ephraim is a partaker with idols let him alone
their banquet is separated they have gone astray by fornication
they that should have protected them have loved to bring shame upon
them
the wind hath bound them up in its wings and they shall be
confounded because of their sacrifices
for their idolatry
hear ye this o priests and hearken o ye house of israel and
give ear o house of the king for there is a judgment against you
because you have been a snare to them whom you should have watched over
and a net spread upon thabor
understood of the priests of the kingdom of israel who were not true
priests of the race of aaron but served the calves at bethel and dan
and you have turned aside victims into the depth and i am the
teacher of them all
i know ephraim and israel is not hid from me for now ephraim hath
committed fornication israel is defiled
they will not set their thoughts to return to their god for the
spirit of fornication is in the midst of them and they have not known
the lord
and the pride of israel shall answer in his face and israel and
with their flocks and with their herds they shall go to seek the
they have transgressed against the lord for they have begotten
children that are strangers now shall a month devour them with their
portions
they are threatened with speedy destruction
blow ye the cornet in gabaa the trumpet in rama howl ye in
ephraim shall be in desolation in the day of rebuke among the
tribes of israel i have shewn that which shall surely be
the princes of juda are become as they that take up the bound i
will pour out my wrath upon them like water
boundary encroaching on the property of their neighbors figuratively
going beyond the boundary of the laws of god
ephraim is under oppression and broken in judgment because he
began to go after filthiness
and i will be like a moth to ephraim and like rottenness to the
house of juda
and ephraim saw his sickness and juda his band and ephraim went
to the assyrian and sent to the avenging king and he shall not be able
to heal you neither shall he be able to take off the band from you
for i will be like a lioness to ephraim and like a lions whelp
to the house of juda i i will catch and go i will take away and
there is none that can rescue
i will go and return to my place until you are consumed and seek
my face
untowardness of the jews god loves mercy more than sacrifice
in their affliction they will rise early to me come and let us
return to the lord
for he hath taken us and he will heal us he will strike and he
will cure us
he will revive us after two days on the third day he will raise us
up and we shall live in his sight we shall know and we shall follow
on that we may know the lord his going forth is prepared as the
morning light and he will come to us as the early and the latter rain
to the earth
what shall i do to thee o ephraim what shall i do to thee o
in the morning
for this reason have i hewed them by the prophets i have slain
them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments shall go forth as the
light
for i desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god
more than holocausts
but they like adam have transgressed the covenant there have
they dealt treacherously against me
galaad is a city of workers of idols supplanted with blood
shedding of blood and as it is signified in the following verse for
conspiring with the priests of bethel like robbers to murder in the
way such as passed out of sichem to go towards the temple of jerusalem
with blood as to suffer none to walk there without imbruing the soles
of their feet in blood
and like the jaws of highway robbers they conspire with the
priests who murder in the way those that pass out of sichem for they
have wrought wickedness
i have seen a horrible thing in the house of israel the
fornications of ephraim there israel is defiled
and thou also o juda set thee a harvest when i shall bring back
the captivity of my people
healing them
when i would have healed israel the iniquity of ephraim was
discovered and the wickedness of samaria for they have committed
falsehood and the thief is come in to steal the robber is without
and lest they may say in their hearts that i remember all their
wickedness their own devices now have beset them about they have been
done before my face
they have made the king glad with their wickedness and the princes
with their lies
they have given themselves up to the wicked worship of idols which are
mere falsehood and lies
they are all adulterers like an oven heated by the baker the city
rested a little from the mingling of the leaven till the whole was
leavened
the day of our king the princes began to be mad with wine he
stretched out his hand with scorners
because they have applied their heart like an oven when he laid
snares for them he slept all the night baking them in the morning he
himself was heated as a flaming fire
they were all heated like an oven and have devoured their judges
all their kings have fallen there is none amongst them that calleth
unto me
ephraim himself is mixed among the nations ephraim is become as
bread baked under the ashes that is not turned
strangers have devoured his strength and he knew it not yea grey
hairs also are spread about upon him and he is ignorant of it
and the pride of israel shall be humbled before his face and they
have not returned to the lord their god nor have they sought him in all
these
and ephraim is become as a dove that is decoyed not having a
heart they called upon egypt they went to the assyrians
and when they shall go i will spread my net upon them i will
bring them down as the fowl of the air i will strike them as their
congregation hath heard
woe to them for they have departed from me they shall be wasted
because they have transgressed against me and i redeemed them and they
have spoken lies against me
and they have not cried to me with their heart but they howled in
their beds they have thought upon wheat and wine they are departed
from me
and i have chastised them and strengthened their arms and they
have imagined evil against me
they returned that they might be without yoke they became like a
deceitful bow their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of
their tongue this is their derision in the land of egypt
idolatry
let there be a trumpet in thy throat like an eagle upon the house
of the lord because they have transgressed my covenant and have
violated my law
they shall call upon me o my god we israel know thee
israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shall pursue
him
they have reigned but not by me they have been princes and i
knew not of their silver and their gold they have made idols to
themselves that they might perish
thy calf o samaria is cast off my wrath is kindled against them
for itself also is the invention of israel a workman made it and
it is no god for the calf of samaria shall be turned to spiders webs
for they shall sow wind and reap a whirlwind there is no standing
stalk in it the bud shall yield no meal and if it should yield
strangers shall eat it
israel is swallowed up now is he become among the nations like an
unclean vessel
for they are gone up to assyria a wild ass alone by himself
but even though they shall have hired the nations now will i
gather them together and they shall rest a while from the burden of the
king and the princes
because ephraim hath made many altars to sin altars are become to
him unto sin
i shall write to him my manifold laws which have been accounted
as foreign
they shall offer victims they shall sacrifice flesh and shall
eat it and the lord will not receive them now will he remember their
iniquity and will visit their sins they shall return to egypt
and israel hath forgotten his maker and hath built temples and
cities and it shall devour the houses thereof
rejoice not o israel rejoice not as the nations do for thou hast
committed fornication against thy god thou hast loved a reward upon
every cornfloor
the floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the wine shall
deceive them
they shall not dwell in the lords land ephraim is returned to
they shall not offer wine to the lord neither shall they please
him their sacrifices shall be like the bread of mourners all that
shall eat it shall be defiled for their bread is life for their soul
it shall not enter into the house of the lord
what will you do in the solemn day in the day of the feast of the
for behold they are gone because of destruction egypt shall gather
them together memphis shall bury them nettles shall inherit their
beloved silver the bur shall be in their tabernacles
the days of visitation are come the days of repaying are come
know ye o israel that the prophet was foolish the spiritual man was
mad for the multitude of thy iniquity and the multitude of thy
madness
the watchman of ephraim was with my god the prophet is become a
snare of ruin upon all his ways madness is in the house of his god
they have sinned deeply as in the days of gabaa he will remember
their iniquity and will visit their sin
i found israel like grapes in the desert i saw their fathers like
the firstfruits of the fig tree in the top thereof but they went in to
abominable as those things were which they loved
as for ephraim their glory hath flown away like bird from the
birth and from the womb and from the conception
and though they should bring up their children i will make them
without children among men yea and woe to them when i shall depart
from them
ephraim as i saw was a tyre founded in beauty and ephraim
shall bring out his children to the murderer
give them o lord what wilt thou give them give them a womb
without children and dry breasts
all their wickedness is in galgal for there i hated them for the
wickedness of their devices i will cast them forth out of my house i
will love them no more all their princes are revolters
ephraim is struck their root is dried up they shall yield no
fruit and if they should have issue i will slay the best beloved fruit
of their womb
my god will cast them away because they hearkened not to him and
they shall be wanderers among the nations
for their ingratitude to god
israel a vine full of branches the fruit is agreeable to it
according to the multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied altars
according to the plenty of his land he hath abounded with idols
their heart is divided now they shall perish he shall break down
their idols he shall destroy their altars
for now they shall say we have no king because we fear not the
you speak words of an unprofitable vision and you shall make a
covenant and judgment shall spring up as bitterness in the furrows of
the field
the inhabitants of samaria have worshipped the kine of bethaven
for the people thereof have mourned over it and the wardens of its
temple that rejoiced over it in its glory because it is departed from
it
for itself also is carried into assyria a present to the avenging
king shame shall fall upon ephraim and israel shall be confounded in
his own will
king manahem to phul king of the assyrians to engage him to stand by
him
samaria hath made her king to pass as froth upon the face of the
water
and the high places of the idol the sin of israel shall be
destroyed the bur and the thistle shall grow up over their altars and
they shall say to the mountains cover us and to the hills fall upon
us
from the days of gabaa israel hath sinned there they stood the
battle in gabaa against the children of iniquity shall not overtake
them
according to my desire i will chastise them and the nations
shall be gathered together against them when they shall be chastised
for their two iniquities
ephraim is a heifer taught to love to tread out corn but i
passed over upon the beauty of her neck i will ride upon ephraim juda
shall plough jacob shall break the furrows for himself
sow for yourselves in justice and reap in the mouth of mercy
break up your fallow ground but the time to seek the lord is when he
shall come that shall teach you justice
you have ploughed wickedness you have reaped iniquity you have
eaten the fruit of lying because thou hast trusted in thy ways in the
multitude of thy strong ones
a tumult shall arise among thy people and all thy fortresses
shall be destroyed as salmana was destroyed by the house of him that
judged baal in the day of battle the mother being dashed in pieces upon
her children
by the followers of him that judged baal that is of gideon who threw
down the altar of baal and was therefore called jerubaal see judges
and
so hath bethel done to you because of the evil of your
iniquities
not utterly destroy them
as the morning passeth so hath the king of israel passed away
text is also applicable to christ as we learn from matthew
as they called them they went away from before their face they
offered victims to baalim and sacrificed to idols
other gods and would not hear
and i was like a foster father to ephraim i carried them in my
arms and they knew not that i healed them
i will draw them with the cords of adam with the bands of love
and i will be to them as one that taketh off the yoke on their jaws and
he shall not return into the land of egypt but the assyrian shall
be his king because they would not be converted
the sword hath begun in his cities and it shall consume his
chosen men and shall devour their heads
and my people shall long for my return but a yoke shall be put
upon them together which shall not be taken off
how shall i deal with thee o ephraim shall i protect thee o
heart is turned within me my repentance is stirred up
i will not execute the fierceness of my wrath i will not return
to destroy ephraim because i am god and not man the holy one in the
midst of thee and i will not enter into the city
they shall walk after the lord he shall roar as a lion because
he shall roar and the children of the sea shall fear
and they shall fly away like a bird out of egypt and like a dove
out of the land of the assyrians and i will place them in their own
houses saith the lord
ephraim hath compassed me about with denials and the house of
faithful with the saints
ephraim feedeth on the wind and followeth the burning heat all
the day long he multiplied lies and desolation and he hath made a
covenant with the assyrians and carried oil into egypt
therefore there is a judgment of the lord with juda and a
visitation for jacob he will render to him according to his ways and
according to his devices
in the womb he supplanted his brother and by his strength he had
success with an angel
and he prevailed over the angel and was strengthened he wept
and made supplication to him he found him in bethel and there he spoke
with us
even the lord god of hosts the lord is his memorial
therefore turn thou to thy god keep mercy and judgment and hope
in thy god always
he is like chanaan there is a deceitful balance in his hand he
hath loved oppression
and ephraim said but yet i am become rich i have found me an
idol all my labours shall not find me the iniquity that i have
committed
and i that am the lord thy god from the land of egypt will yet
cause thee to dwell in tabernacles as in the days of the feast
and i have spoken by the prophets and i have multiplied visions
and i have used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets
if galaad be an idol then in vain were they in galgal offering
sacrifices with bullocks for their altars also are as heaps in the
furrows of the field
sacrifices be like a mere idol itself being brought to nothing by
jacob fled into the country of syria and israel served for a
wife and was a keeper for a wife
but the lord by a prophet brought israel out of egypt and he was
preserved by a prophet
ephraim hath provoked me to wrath with his bitterness and his
blood shall come upon him and his lord will render his reproach unto
him
redeem them
when ephraim spoke a horror seized israel and he sinned in baal
and died
and now they have sinned more and more and they have made to
themselves a molten thing of their silver as the likeness of idols the
whole is the work of craftsmen to these that say sacrifice men ye
that adore calves
therefore they shall be as a morning cloud and as the early dew
that passeth away as the dust that is driven with a whirlwind out of
the floor and as the smoke out of the chimney
but i am the lord thy god from the land of egypt and thou shalt
know no god but me and there is no saviour beside me
i knew thee in the desert in the land of the wilderness
according to their pastures they were filled and were made full
and they lifted up their heart and have forgotten me
and i will be to them as a lioness as a leopard in the way of the
i will meet them as a bear that is robbed of her whelps and i
will rend the inner parts of their liver and i will devour them there
as a lion the beast of the field shall tear them
destruction is thy own o israel thy help is only in me
where is thy king now especially let him save thee in all thy
cities and thy judges of whom thou saidst give me kings and princes
i will give thee a king in my wrath and will take him away in my
indignation
the iniquity of ephraim is bound up his sin is hidden
the sorrows of a woman in labour shall come upon him he is an
unwise son for now he shall not stand in the breach of the children
i will deliver them out of the hand of death i will redeem them
from death o death i will be thy death o hell i will be thy bite
comfort is hidden from my eyes
because he shall make a separation between brothers the lord
will bring a burning wind that shall rise from the desert and it shall
dry up his springs and shall make his fountain desolate and he shall
carry off the treasure of every desirable vessel
through christ to the penitent
let samaria perish because she hath stirred up her god to
bitterness let them perish by the sword let their little ones be
dashed and let the women with child be ripped up
curse or imprecation but a prophecy of what should come to pass
return o israel to the lord thy god for thou hast fallen down
by thy iniquity
take with you words and return to the lord and say to him take
away all iniquity and receive the good and we will render the calves
of our lips
assyria shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither
will we say any more the works of our hands are our gods for thou wilt
have mercy on the fatherless that is in thee
i will heal their breaches i will love them freely for my wrath
is turned away from them
i will be as the dew israel shall spring as the lily and his
root shall shoot forth as that of libanus
his branches shall spread and his glory shall be as the olive
tree and his smell as that of libanus
they shall be converted that sit under his shadow they shall live
upon wheat and they shall blossom as a vine his memorial shall be as
the wine of libanus
ephraim shall say what have i to do any more with idols i will
hear him and i will make him flourish like a green fir tree from me is
thy fruit found
who is wise and he shall understand these things prudent and
he shall know these things for the ways of the lord are right and the
just shall walk in them but the transgressors shall fall in them
as others say the coming down of god prophesied about the same time in
the kingdom of judea as osee did in the kingdom of israel he foretells
under figure the great evils that were coming upon the people for their
sins earnestly exhorts them to repentance and comforts them with the
promise of a teacher of justice viz christ jesus our lord and of the
coming down of his holy spirit
