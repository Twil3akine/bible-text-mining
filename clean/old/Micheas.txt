also invade juda and jerusalem
the word of the lord that came to micheas the morasthite in the
days of joathan achaz and ezechias kings of juda which he saw
concerning samaria and jerusalem
hear all ye people and let the earth give ear and all that is
therein and let the lord god be a witness to you the lord from his
holy temple
for behold the lord will come forth out of his place and he will
come down and will tread upon the high places of the earth
and the mountains shall be melted under him and the valleys shall
be cleft as wax before the fire and as waters that run down a steep
place
for the wickedness of jacob is all this and for the sins of the
house of israel what is the wickedness of jacob is it not samaria and
what are the high places of juda are they not jerusalem
and i will make samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a
vineyard is planted and i will bring down the stones thereof into the
valley and will lay her foundations bare
and all her graven things shall be cut in pieces and all her wages
shall be burnt with fire and i will bring to destruction all her idols
for they were gathered together of the hire of a harlot and unto the
hire of a harlot they shall return
the hire of all her traffic and labour ibid of the hire of a harlot
etc they were gathered together by one idolatrous city viz
viz ninive
therefore will i lament and howl i will go stript and naked i
will make a wailing like the dragons and a mourning like the ostriches
because her wound is desperate because it is come even to juda it
hath touched the gate of my people even to jerusalem
shall be followed by the invasion of my people of juda and the
declare ye it not in geth weep ye not with tears in the house of
rejoice at your calamityibid weep ye not etc keep in your tears
that you may not give your enemies an occasion of insulting over you
but in your own houses or in your house of dust your earthly
habitation sprinkle yourselves with dust and put on the habit of
penitents some take the house of dust in hebrew aphrah to be the
proper name of a city
and pass away o thou that dwellest in the beautiful place
covered with thy shame she went not forth that dwelleth in the
confines the house adjoining shall receive mourning from you which
stood by herself
take for the proper name of a cityibid she went not forth etc
that is they that dwelt in the confines came not forth but kept
themselves within for fearibid the house adjoiningetc viz
shall share also in her mourning and calamity though they have
pretended to stand by themselves trusting in their strength
for she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in bitterness for
evil is come down from the lord into the gate of jerusalem
because she dwells in the bitterness of sin
a tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of lachis it
is the beginning of sin to the daughter of sion for in thee were found
the crimes of israel
that learned from samaria the worship of idols and communicated it to
therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of geth
the houses of lying to deceive the kings of israel
in vain for geth instead of helping shall be found to be a house of
lying and deceit to israel
yet will i bring an heir to thee that dwellest in maresa even to
inheritance but here god by his prophet tells the jews that he will
bring them an heir to take possession of their inheritance and that the
glory of israel shall be obliged to give place and to retire even to
exhorts them to penance in the following verse
make thee bald and be polled for thy delicate children enlarge
thy baldness as the eagle for they are carried into captivity from
thee
shall at last restore jacob
woe to you that devise that which is unprofitable and work evil in
your beds in the morning light they execute it because their hand is
against god
and they have coveted fields and taken them by violence and
houses they have forcibly taken away and oppressed a man and his house
a man and his inheritance
therefore thus saith the lord behold i devise an evil against this
family from which you shall not withdraw your necks and you shall not
walk haughtily for this is a very evil time
in that day a parable shall be taken up upon you and a song shall
be sung with melody by them that say we are laid waste and spoiled the
portion of my people is changed how shall he depart from me whereas he
is returning that will divide our land
is departing when indeed he is coming to divide our lands amongst his
subjects
therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the cord of a lot in
the assembly of the lord
inheritance in the land of the people of the lord
speak ye not saying it shall not drop upon these confusion shall
not take them
these such were the sentiments of the people that were unwilling to
believe the threats of the prophets
the house of jacob saith is the spirit of the lord straitened or
are these his thoughts are not my words good to him that walketh
uprightly
but my people on the contrary are risen up as an enemy you have
taken away the cloak off from the coat and them that passed harmless
you have turned to war
necessary garments and have treated such as were innocently passing on
the way as if they were at war with you
you have cast out the women of my people from their houses in
which they took delight you have taken my praise forever from their
children
by your crimes given occasion to their being carried away captives and
their children by that means never learning to praise the lord
arise ye and depart for there is no rest here for you for that
uncleanness of the land it shall be corrupted with a grievous
corruption
would god i were not a man that hath the spirit and that i rather
spoke a lie i will let drop to thee of wine and of drunkenness and it
shall be this people upon whom it shall drop
people that he might be deceived in denouncing to them these evils that
were to fall upon them but by conforming himself to the will of god he
declares to them that he is sent to prophesy literally to let drop
upon them the wine of gods indignation with which they should be made
drunk that is stupefied and cast down
i will assemble and gather together all of thee o jacob i will
bring together the remnant of israel i will put them together as a
flock in the fold as sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes they shall
make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men
for he shall go up that shall open the way before them they shall
divide and pass through the gate and shall come in by it and their
king shall pass before them and the lord at the head of them
flattering for lucre and of judges perverting justice jerusalem and
the temple shall be destroyed
and i said hear o ye princes of jacob and ye chiefs of the house
of israel is it not your part to know judgment
you that hate good and love evil that violently pluck off their
skins from them and their flesh from their bones
who have eaten the flesh of my people and have flayed their skin
off them and have broken and chopped their bones as for the kettle
and as flesh in the midst of the pot
then shall they cry to the lord and he will not hear them and he
will hide his face from them at that time as they have behaved wickedly
in their devices
thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that make my people
err that bite with their teeth and preach peace and if a man give not
something into their mouth they prepare war against him
therefore night shall be to you instead of vision and darkness to
you instead of divination and the sun shall go down upon the prophets
and the day shall be darkened over them
and they shall be confounded that see visions and the diviners
shall be confounded and they shall all cover their faces because there
is no answer of god
but yet i am filled with the strength of the spirit of the lord
with judgment and power to declare unto jacob his wickedness and to
hear this ye princes of the house of jacob and ye judges of the
house of israel you that abhor judgment and pervert all that is right
you that build up sion with blood and jerusalem with iniquity
her princes have judged for bribes and her priests have taught
for hire and her prophets divined for money and they leaned upon the
among us
therefore because of you sion shall be ploughed as a field and
as the high places of the forests
and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of
the house of the lord shall be prepared in the top of the mountains and
high above the hills and people shall flow to it
and many nations shall come in haste and say come let us go up
to the mountain of the lord and to the house of the god of jacob and
he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for the law
shall go forth out of sion and the word of the lord out of jerusalem
and he shall judge among many people and rebuke strong nations
afar off and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their
spears into spades nation shall not take sword against nation neither
shall they learn war anymore
and all his true subjects as much as lies in them love and keep peace
with all the world
and every man shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree and
there shall be none to make them afraid for the mouth of the lord of
hosts hath spoken
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god but we
will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever
in that day saith the lord i will gather up her that halteth and
her that i had cast out i will gather up and her whom i had afflicted
and i will make her that halted a remnant and her that had been
afflicted a mighty nation and the lord will reign over them in mount
and thou o cloudy tower of the flock of the daughter of sion
unto thee shall it come yea the first power shall come the kingdom to
the daughter of jerusalem
now why art thou drawn together with grief hast thou no king in
thee or is thy counselor perished because sorrow hath taken thee as a
woman in labour
be in pain and labour o daughter of sion as a woman that
bringeth forth for now shalt thou go out of the city and shalt dwell
in the country and shalt come even to babylon there thou shalt be
delivered there the lord will redeem thee out of the hand of thy
enemies
and now many nations are gathered together against thee and they
say let her be stoned and let our eye look upon sion
but they have not known the thoughts of the lord and have not
understood his counsel because he hath gathered them together as the
hay of the floor
arise and tread o daughter of sion for i will make thy horn
iron and thy hoofs i will make brass and thou shalt beat in pieces
many peoples and shalt immolate the spoils of them to the lord and
their strength to the lord of the whole earth
now shalt thou be laid waste o daughter of the robber they have
laid siege against us with a rod shall they strike the cheek of the
judge of israel
and pillaged the temple of god others understand it of jerusalem by
reason of the many rapines and oppressions committed there
and thou bethlehem ephrata art a little one among the thousands of
eternity
therefore will he give them up even till the time wherein she that
travaileth shall bring forth and the remnant of his brethren shall be
converted to the children of israel
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the
height of the name of the lord his god and they shall be converted
for now shall he be magnified even to the ends of the earth
and this man shall be our peace when the assyrian shall come into
our land and when he shall set his foot in our houses and we shall
raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men
called assyrians by the prophet because the assyrians were at that time
the chief enemies and persecutors of the people of godibid seven
shepherds etc viz the pastors of gods church and the defenders
of the faith the number seven in scripture is taken to signify many
and when eight is joined with it we are to understand that the number
will be very great
and they shall feed the land of assyria with the sword and the
land of nemrod with the spears thereof and he shall deliver us from the
our borders
of their persecutors with the word of the spirit which is the word of
and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as
a dew from the lord and as drops upon the grass which waiteth not for
man nor tarrieth for the children of men
the jewish nation whose doctrine like dew shall make the plants of
the converted gentiles grow up without waiting for any man to cultivate
them by human learning
and the remnant of jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst
of many peoples as a lion among the beasts of the forests and as a
young lion among the flocks of sheep who when he shall go through and
tread down and take there is none to deliver
and their success in their spiritual enterprises
thy hand shall be lifted up over thy enemies and all thy enemies
shall be cut off
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that i will
take away thy horses out of the midst of thee and will destroy thy
chariots
follows to the end of the chapter as addressed to the enemies of the
church but it may as well be understood of the converts to the church
who should no longer put their trust in any of these things
and i will destroy the cities of thy land and will throw down all
thy strong holds and i will take away sorceries out of thy hand and
there shall be no divinations in thee
and i will destroy thy graven things and thy statues out of the
midst of thee and thou shalt no more adore the works of thy hands
and i will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee and will
crush thy cities
and i will execute vengeance in wrath and in indignation among
all the nations that have not given ear
they shall be punished
hear ye what the lord saith arise contend thou in judgment
against the mountains and let the hills hear thy voice
people
let the mountains hear the judgment of the lord and the strong
foundations of the earth for the lord will enter into judgment with his
people and he will plead against israel
o my people what have i done to thee or in what have i molested
thee answer thou me
for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt and delivered thee
out of the house of slaves and i sent before thy face moses and aaron
and mary
o my people remember i pray thee what balach the king of moab
purposed and what balaam the son of beor answered him from setim to
in not suffering them to be quite destroyed by the evil purpose of
the wonders he wrought in order to bring them into the land of promise
by stopping the course of the jordan in their march from setim to
what shall i offer to the lord that is worthy wherewith shall i
kneel before the high god shall i offer holocausts unto him and calves
of a year old
desiring to be informed what they are to do to please god
may the lord be appeased with thousands of rams or with many
thousands of fat hegoats shall i give my firstborn for my wickedness
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul
i will shew thee o man what is good and what the lord requireth
of thee verily to do judgment and to love mercy and to walk
solicitous with thy god
the voice of the lord crieth to the city and salvation shall be to
them that fear thy name hear o ye tribes and who shall approve it
as yet there is a fire in the house of the wicked the treasures
of iniquity and a scant measure full of wrath
shall i justify wicked balances and the deceitful weights of the
bag
by which her rich men were filled with iniquity and the
inhabitants thereof have spoken lies and their tongue was deceitful in
their mouth
and i therefore began to strike thee with desolation for thy sins
thou shalt eat but shalt not be filled and thy humiliation shall
be in the midst of thee and thou shalt take hold but shalt not save
and those whom thou shalt save i will give up to the sword
thou shalt sow but shalt not reap thou shalt tread the olives
but shalt not be anointed with oil and the new wine but shalt not
drink the wine
for thou hast kept the statutes of amri and all the works of the
house of achab and thou hast walked according their wills that i
should make thee a desolation and the inhabitants thereof a hissing
and you shall bear the reproach of my people
idolatrous kings
generality are still corrupt in their manners therefore their
desolation is at hand but they shall be restored again and prosper and
all mankind shall be redeemed by christ
woe is me for i am become as one that gleaneth in autumn the
grapes of the vintage there is no cluster to eat my soul desired the
first ripe figs
the holy man is perished out of the earth and there is none
upright among men they all lie in wait for blood every one hunteth his
brother to death
the evil of their hands they call good the prince requireth and
the judge is for giving and the great man hath uttered the desire of
his soul and they have troubled it
he that is best among them is as a brier and he that is
righteous as the thorn of the hedge the day of thy inspection thy
visitation cometh now shall be their destruction
believe not a friend and trust not in a prince keep the doors of
thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom
for the son dishonoureth the father and the daughter riseth up
against her mother the daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw and a
mans enemies are they of his own household
but i will look towards the lord i will wait for god my saviour
my god will hear me
rejoice not thou my enemy over me because i am fallen i shall
arise when i sit in darkness the lord is my light
i will bear the wrath of the lord because i have sinned against
him until he judge my cause and execute judgement for me he will
bring me forth into the light i shall behold his justice
and my enemy shall behold and she shall be covered with shame
who saith to me where is the lord thy god my eyes shall look down upon
her now shall she be trodden under foot as the mire of the streets
the day shall come that thy walls may be built up in that day
shall the law be far removed
in that day they shall come even from assyria to thee and to the
fortified cities and from the fortified cities even to the river and
from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain
and the land shall be made desolate because of the inhabitants
thereof and for the fruit of their devices
feed thy people with thy rod the flock of thy inheritance them
that dwell alone in the forest in the midst of carmel they shall feed
in basan and galaad according to the days of old
according to the days of thy coming out of the land of egypt i
will shew him wonders
the nations shall see and shall be confounded at all their
strength they shall put the hand upon the mouth their ears shall be
deaf
they shall lick the dust like serpents as the creeping things of
the earth they shall be disturbed in their houses they shall dread the
who is a god like to thee who takest away iniquity and passest
by the sin of the remnant of thy inheritance he will send his fury in
no more because he delighteth in mercy
he will turn again and have mercy on us he will put away our
iniquities and he will cast all our sins into the bottom of the sea
thou wilt perform the truth to jacob the mercy to abraham which
thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old
the ten tribes were carried into captivity and foretold the utter
destruction of ninive by the babylonians and medes which happened in
the reign of josias
