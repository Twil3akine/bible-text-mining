to come for which disobedience she is deposed
in the days of assuerus who reigned from india to ethiopia over a
hundred and twenty seven provinces
when he sat on the throne of his kingdom the city susan was the
capital of his kingdom
now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all
the princes and for his servants for the most mighty of the persians
and the nobles of the medes and the governors of the provinces in his
sight
that he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom and the
greatness and boasting of his power for a long time to wit for a
hundred and fourscore days
and when the days of the feast were expired he invited all the
people that were found in susan from the greatest to the least and
commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden and
of the wood which was planted by the care and the hand of the king
and there were hung up on every side sky coloured and green and
violet hangings fastened with cords of silk and of purple which were
put into rings of ivory and were held up with marble pillars the beds
also were of gold and silver placed in order upon a floor paved with
porphyry and white marble which was embellished with painting of
wonderful variety
and they that were invited drank in golden cups and the meats
were brought in divers vessels one after another wine also in abundance
and of the best was presented as was worthy of a kings magnificence
neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not
willing but as the king had appointed who set over every table one of
his nobles that every man might take what he would
also vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace
where king assuerus was used to dwell
now on the seventh day when the king was merry and after very
much drinking was well warmed with wine he commanded mauman and
the seven eunuchs that served in his presence
to bring in queen vasthi before the king with the crown set upon
her head to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes for she
was exceeding beautiful
but she refused and would not come at the kings commandment
which he had signified to her by the eunuchs whereupon the king being
angry and inflamed with a very great fury
asked the wise men who according to the custom of the kings were
always near his person and all he did was by their counsel who knew
the laws and judgments of their forefathers
now the chief and nearest him were charsena and sethar and
princes of the persians and of the medes who saw the face of the king
and were used to sit first after him
what sentence ought to pass upon vasthi the queen who had refused
to obey the commandment of king assuerus which he had sent to her by
the eunuchs
and mamuchan answered in the hearing of the king and the princes
princes that are in all the provinces of king assuerus
for this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women so that
they will despise their husbands and will say king assuerus commanded
that queen vasthi should come in to him and she would not
and by this example all the wives of the princes of the persians
and the medes will slight the commandments of their husbands wherefore
the kings indignation is just
if it please thee let an edict go out from thy presence and let
it be written according to the law of the persians and of the medes
which must not be altered that vasthi come in no more to the king but
another that is better than her be made queen in her place
and let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire
which is very wide and let all wives as well of the greater as of
the lesser give honour to their husbands
his counsel pleased the king and the princes and the king did
according to the counsel of mamuchan
and he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom as every
nation could hear and read in divers languages and characters that the
husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses and that this
should be published to every people
king
after this when the wrath of king assuerus was appeased he
remembered vasthi and what she had done and what she had suffered
and the kings servants and his officers said let young women be
sought for the king virgins and beautiful
and let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for
beautiful maidens and virgins and let them bring them to the city of
the eunuch who is the overseer and keeper of the kings women and let
them receive womens ornaments and other things necessary for their
use
and whosoever among them all shall please the kings eyes let her
be queen instead of vasthi the word pleased the king and he commanded
it should be done as they had suggested
there was a man in the city of susan a jew named mardochai the
son of jair the son of semei the son of cis of the race of jemini
who had been carried away from jerusalem at the time that
and he had brought up his brothers daughter edissa who by another
name was called esther now she had lost both her parents and was
exceeding fair and beautiful and her father and mother being dead
and when the kings ordinance was noised abroad and according to
his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to susan and were
delivered to egeus the eunuch esther also among the rest of the maidens
was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women
and she pleased him and found favour in his sight and he
commanded the eunuch to hasten the womens ornaments and to deliver to
her her part and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the kings
house and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids
and she would not tell him her people nor her country for
and he walked every day before the court of the house in which
the chosen virgins were kept having a care for esthers welfare and
desiring to know what would befall her
now when every virgins turn came to go in to the king after all
had been done for setting them off to advantage it was the twelfth
month so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh and
for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices
and when they were going in to the king whatsoever they asked to
adorn themselves they received and being decked out as it pleased
them they passed from the chamber of the women to the kings chamber
and she that went in at evening came out in the morning and from
thence she was conducted to the second house that was under the hand of
neither could she return any more to the king unless the king desired
it and had ordered her by name to come
and as the time came orderly about the day was at hand when
adopted for his daughter was to go in to the king but she sought not
womens ornaments but whatsoever egeus the eunuch the keeper of the
virgins had a mind he gave her to adorn her for she was exceeding
fair and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in
the eyes of all
so she was brought to the chamber of king assuerus the tenth
month which is called tebeth in the seventh year of his reign
and the king loved her more than all the women and she had favour
and kindness before him above all the women and he set the royal crown
on her head and made her queen instead of vasthi
and he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the
princes and for his servants for the marriage and wedding of esther
princely magnificence
and when the virgins were sought the second time and gathered
together mardochai stayed at the kings gate
neither had esther as yet declared her country and people
according to his commandment for whatsoever he commanded esther
observed and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at
that time when he brought her up a little one
at that time therefore when mardochai abode at the kings gate
presided in the first entry of the palace were angry and they designed
to rise up against the king and to kill him
and mardochai had notice of it and immediately he told it to
queen esther and she to the king in mardochais name who had reported
the thing unto her
it was inquired into and found out and they were both hanged on
a gibbet and it was put in the histories and recorded in the
chronicles before the king
procureth the kings decree to destroy the whole nation of the jews
after these things king assuerus advanced aman the son of
the princes that were with him
and all the kings servants that were at the doors of the palace
bent their knees and worshipped aman for so the emperor had commanded
them only mardochai did not bend his knee nor worship him
and the kings servants that were chief at the doors of the palace
said to him why dost thou alone not observe the kings commandment
and when they were saying this often and he would not hearken to
them they told aman desirous to know whether he would continue in his
resolution for he had told them that he was a jew
now when aman had heard this and had proved by experience that
exceeding angry
and he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon mardochai alone
for he had heard that he was of the nation of the jews and he chose
rather to destroy all the nation of the jews that were in the kingdom of
in the first month which is called nisan in the twelfth year of
the reign of assuerus the lot was cast into an urn which in hebrew is
called phur before aman on what day and what month the nation of the
called adar
and aman said to king assuerus there is a people scattered through
all the provinces of thy kingdom and separated one from another that
use new laws and ceremonies and moreover despise the kings ordinances
and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that
they should grow insolent by impunity
if it please thee decree that they may be destroyed and i will
pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers
and the king took the ring that he used from his own hand and
gave it to aman the son of amadathi of the race of agag the enemy of
the jews
and he said to him as to the money which thou promisest keep it
for thyself and as to the people do with them as seemeth good to thee
and the kings scribes were called in the first month nisan on
the thirteenth day of the same mouth and they wrote as aman had
commanded to all the kings lieutenants and to the judges of the
provinces and of divers nations as every nation could read and hear
according to their different languages in the name of king assuerus
and the letters sealed with his ring
were sent by the kings messengers to all provinces to kill and
destroy all the jews both young and old little children and women in
one day that is on the thirteenth of the twelfth month which is
called adar and to make a spoil of their goods
and the contents of the letters were to this effect that all
provinces might know and be ready against that day
the couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the kings
commandment and immediately the edict was hung up in susan the king
and aman feasting together and all the jews that were in the city
weeping
in fasting and prayer
now when mardochai had heard these things he rent his garments
and put on sackcloth strewing ashes on his head and he cried with a
loud voice in the street in the midst of the city shewing the anguish
of his mind
and he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the
palace for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the kings court
and in all provinces towns and places to which the kings cruel
edict was come there was great mourning among the jews with fasting
wailing and weeping many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed
then esthers maids and her eunuchs went in and told her and when
she heard it she was in a consternation and she sent a garment to
clothe him and to take away the sackcloth but he would not receive it
and she called for athach the eunuch whom the king had appointed
to attend upon her and she commanded him to go to mardochai and learn
of him why he did this
and athach going out went to mardochai who was standing in the
street of the city before the palace gate
and mardochai told him all that had happened how aman had promised
to pay money into the kings treasures to have the jews destroyed
he gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in susan
that he should shew it to the queen and admonish her to go in to the
king and to entreat him for her people
and athach went back and told esther all that mardochai had said
she answered him and bade him say to mardochai
all the kings servants and all the provinces that are under his
dominion know that whosoever whether man or woman cometh into the
kings inner court who is not called for is immediately to be put to
death without any delay except the king shall hold out the golden
sceptre to him in token of clemency that so he may live how then can
unto him
and when mardochai had heard this
he sent word to esther again saying think not that thou mayst
save thy life only because thou art in the kings house more than all
the jews
for if thou wilt now hold thy peace the jews shall be delivered
by some other occasion and thou and thy fathers house shall perish
thou mightest be ready in such a time as this
and again esther sent to mardochai in these words
go and gather together all the jews whom thou shalt find in
three nights and i with my handmaids will fast in like manner and then
myself to death and to danger
so mardochai went and did all that esther had commanded him
and on the third day esther put on her royal apparel and stood in
the inner court of the kings house over against the kings hall now
he sat upon his throne in the hall of the palace over against the door
of the house
and when he saw esther the queen standing she pleased his eyes
and he held out toward her the golden sceptre which he held in his hand
and she drew near and kissed the top of his sceptre
and the king said to her what wilt thou queen esther what is
thy request if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom it shall
be given to thee
but she answered if it please the king i beseech thee to come to
me this day and aman with thee to the banquet which i have prepared
and the king said forthwith call ye aman quickly that he may obey
had prepared for them
and the king said to her after he had drunk wine plentifully what
dost thou desire should be given thee and for what thing askest thou
although thou shouldst ask the half of my kingdom thou shalt have it
and esther answered my petition and request is this
if i have found favour in the kings sight and if it please the
king to give me what i ask and to fulfil my petition let the king and
will open my mind to the king
so aman went out that day joyful and merry and when he saw
did not rise up to honour him but did not so much as move from the
place where he sat he was exceedingly angry
but dissembling his anger and returning into his house he called
together to him his friends and zares his wife
and he declared to them the greatness of his riches and the
multitude of his children and with how great glory the king had
advanced him above all his princes and servants
and after this he said queen esther also hath invited no other to
the banquet with the king but me and with her i am also to dine to
morrow with the king
and whereas i have all these things i think i have nothing so
long as i see mardochai the jew sitting before the kings gate
then zares his wife and the rest of his friends answered him
speak to the king that mardochai may be hanged upon it and so thou
shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet the counsel pleased
him and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared
that night the king passed without sleep and he commanded the
histories and chronicles of former times to be brought him and when
they were reading them before him
they came to that place where it was written how mardochai had
discovered the treason of bagathan and thares the eunuchs who sought to
kill king assuerus
and when the king heard this he said what honour and reward hath
him he hath received no reward at all
but these were so inconsiderable in the opinion of the courtiers that
they esteemed them as nothing at all
and the king said immediately who is in the court for aman was
coming in to the inner court of the kings house to speak to the king
that he might order mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet which was
prepared for him
the servants answered aman standeth in the court and the king
said let him come in
and when he was come in he said to him what ought to be done to
the man whom the king is desirous to honour but aman thinking in his
heart and supposing that the king would honour no other but himself
answered the man whom the king desireth to honour
ought to be clothed with the kings apparel and to be set upon the
horse that the king rideth upon and to have the royal crown upon his
head
and let the first of the kings princes and nobles hold his horse
and going through the street of the city proclaim before him and say
and the king said to him make haste and take the robe and the
horse and do as thou hast spoken to mardochai the jew who sitteth
before the gates of the palace beware thou pass over any of those
things which thou hast spoken
so aman took the robe and the horse and arraying mardochai in the
street of the city and setting him on the horse went before him and
proclaimed this honour is he worthy of whom the king hath a mind to
honour
but mardochai returned to the palace gate and aman made haste to
go to his house mourning and having his head covered
and he told zares his wife and his friends all that had befallen
him and the wise men whom he had in counsel and his wife answered him
fall thou canst not resist him but thou shalt fall in his sight
as they were yet speaking the kings eunuchs came and compelled
him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared
gibbet he had prepared for mardochai
so the king and aman went in to drink with the queen
and the king said to her again the second day after he was warm
with wine what is thy petition esther that it may be granted thee
and what wilt thou have done although thou ask the half of my kingdom
thou shalt have it
then she answered if i have found favour in thy sight o king and
if it please thee give me my life for which i ask and my people for
which i request
for we are given up i and my people to be destroyed to be slain
and to perish and would god we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen the
evil might be borne with and i would have mourned in silence but now
we have an enemy whose cruelty redoundeth upon the king
and king assuerus answered and said who is this and of what
power that he should do these things
and esther said it is this aman that is our adversary and most
wicked enemy aman hearing this was forthwith astonished not being able
to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen
but the king being angry rose up and went from the place of the
banquet into the garden set with trees aman also rose up to entreat
for him by the king
and when the king came back out of the garden set with trees and
entered into the place of the banquet he found aman was fallen upon the
bed on which esther lay and he said he will force the queen also in my
presence in my own house the word was not yet gone out of the kings
mouth and immediately they covered his face
and harbona one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king
said behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for mardochai who spoke
for the king standeth in amans house being fifty cubits high and the
king said to him hang him upon it
so aman was hanged on the gibbet which he had prepared for
on that day king assuerus gave the house of aman the jews enemy
to queen esther and mardochai came in before the king for esther had
confessed to him that he was her uncle
and the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again
from aman and gave it to mardochai and esther set mardochai over her
house
and not content with these things she fell down at the kings feet
and wept and speaking to him besought him that he would give orders
that the malice of aman the agagite and his most wicked devices which
he had invented against the jews should be of no effect
but he as the manner was held out the golden sceptre with his
hand which was the sign of clemency and she arose up and stood before
him
and said if it please the king and if i have found favour in his
sight and my request be not disagreeable to him i beseech thee that
the former letters of aman the traitor and enemy of the jews by which
he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the kings provinces
may be reversed by new letters
for how can i endure the murdering and slaughter of my people
and king assuerus answered esther the queen and mardochai the jew
hanged on a gibbet because he durst lay hands on the jews
write ye therefore to the jews as it pleaseth you in the kings
name and seal the letters with my ring for this was the custom that
no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the kings name and
were sealed with his ring
then the kings scribes and secretaries were called for now it was
the time of the third month which is called siban the three and
twentieth day of the month and letters were written as mardochai had a
mind to the jews and to the governors and to the deputies and to the
judges who were rulers over the hundred and twentyseven provinces
from india even to ethiopia to province and province to people and
people according to their languages and characters and to the jews
according as they could read and hear
and these letters which were sent in the kings name were sealed
with his ring and sent by posts who were to run through all the
provinces to prevent the former letters with new messages
and the king gave orders to them to speak to the jews in every
city and to command them to gather themselves together and to stand
for their lives and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their
wives and children and all their houses and to take their spoil
and one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces to
wit the thirteenth of the twelfth month adar
and this was the content of the letter that it should be notified
in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king
so the swift posts went out carrying the messages and the kings
edict was hung up in susan
and mardochai going forth out of the palace and from the kings
presence shone in royal apparel to wit of violet and sky colour
wearing a golden crown on his head and clothed with a cloak of silk and
purple and all the city rejoiced and was glad
but to the jews a new light seemed to rise joy honour and
dancing
and in all peoples cities and provinces whithersoever the
kings commandments came there was wonderful rejoicing feasts and
banquets and keeping holy day insomuch that many of other nations and
religion joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies for a great
dread of the name of the jews had fallen upon all
so on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which as we have
said above is called adar when all the jews were designed to be
massacred and their enemies were greedy after their blood the case
being altered the jews began to have the upper hand and to revenge
themselves of their adversaries
king were made executioners of the public justice for punishing by
death a crime worthy of death viz a malicious conspiracy for
extirpating their whole nation
and they gathered themselves together in every city and town and
place to lay their hands on their enemies and their persecutors and
no one durst withstand them for the fear of their power had gone
through every people
and the judges of the provinces and the governors and
lieutenants and every one in dignity that presided over every place
and work extolled the jews for fear of mardochai
for they knew him to be prince of the palace and to have great
power and the fame of his name increased daily and was spread abroad
through all mens mouths
so the jews made a great slaughter of their enemies and killed
them repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them
insomuch that even in susan they killed five hundred men besides
the ten sons of aman the agagite the enemy of the jews whose names are
these
pharsandatha and delphon and esphatha
and phoratha and adalia and aridatha
and phermesta and arisai and aridai and jezatha
and when they had slain them they would not touch the spoils of
their goods
and presently the number of them that were killed in susan was
brought to the king
and he said to the queen the jews have killed five hundred men in
the city of susan besides the ten sons of aman how many dost thou
think they have slain in all the provinces what askest thou more and
what wilt thou have me to command to be done
and she answered if it please the king let it be granted to the
ten sons of aman may be hanged upon gibbets
and the king commanded that it should be so done and forthwith
the edict was hung up in susan and the ten sons of aman were hanged
and on the fourteenth day of the month adar the jews gathered
themselves together and they killed in susan three hundred men but
they took not their substance
moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the
kings dominion the jews stood for their lives and slew their enemies
and persecutors insomuch that the number of them that were killed
amounted to seventyfive thousand and no man took any of their goods
now the thirteenth day of the month adar was the first day with
them all of the slaughter and on the fourteenth day they left off
they should celebrate it with feasting joy and banquets
but they that were killing in the city of susan were employed in
the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month
and on the fifteenth day they rested and therefore they appointed that
day to be a holy day of feasting and gladness
but those jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages
appointed the fourteenth day of the month adar for banquets and
gladness so as to rejoice on that day and send one another portions of
their banquets and meats
and mardochai wrote all these things and sent them comprised in
letters to the jews that abode in all the kings provinces both those
that lay near and those afar off
that they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the
month adar for holy days and always at the return of the year should
celebrate them with solemn honour
because on those days the jews revenged themselves of their
enemies and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy
and that these should be days of feasting and gladness in which they
should send one to another portions of meats and should give gifts to
the poor
and the jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had
begun to do at that time which mardochai by letters had commanded to be
done
for aman the son of amadathi of the race of agag the enemy and
adversary of the jews had devised evil against them to kill them and
destroy them and had cast phur that is the lot
and afterwards esther went in to the king beseeching him that his
endeavours might be made void by the kings letters and the evil that
he had intended against the jews might return upon his own head and so
both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets
and since that time these days are called phurim that is of
lots because phur that is the lot was cast into the urn and all
things that were done are contained in the volume of this epistle that
is of this book
and the things that they suffered and that were afterwards
changed the jews took upon themselves and their seed and upon all that
had a mind to be joined to their religion so that it should be lawful
for none to pass these days without solemnity which the writing
testifieth and certain times require as the years continually succeed
one another
these are the days which shall never be forgot and which all
provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations
neither is there any city wherein the days of phurim that is of lots
must not be observed by the jews and by their posterity which is bound
to these ceremonies
and esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mardochai the
should be established a festival for the time to come
and they sent to all the jews that were in the hundred and twenty
seven provinces of king assuerus that they should have peace and
receive truth
and observe the days of lots and celebrate them with joy in their
proper time as mardochai and esther had appointed and they undertook
them to be observed by themselves and by their seed fasts and cries
and the days of lots
and all things which are contained in the history of this book
which is called esther
and king assuerus made all the land and all the islands of the
sea tributary
and his strength and his empire and the dignity and greatness
wherewith he exalted mardochai are written in the books of the medes
and of the persians
and how mardochai of the race of the jews was next after king
brethren seeking the good of his people and speaking those things
which were for the welfare of his seed
then mardochai said god hath done these things
follows is not in the hebrew but is found in the septuagint greek
edition which the seventytwo interpreters translated out of the
i remember a dream that i saw which signified these same things
and nothing thereof hath failed
general rule is not to observe dreams
the little fountain which grew into a river and was turned into a
light and into the sun and abounded into many waters is esther whom
the king married and made queen
but the two dragons are i and aman
the nations that were assembled are they that endeavoured to
destroy the name of the jews
and my nation is israel who cried to the lord and the lord saved
his people and he delivered us from all evils and hath wrought great
signs and wonders among the nations
and he commanded that there should be two lots one of the people
of god and the other of all the nations
and both lots came to the day appointed already from that time
before god to all nations
and the lord remembered his people and had mercy on his
inheritance
and these days shall be observed in the month of adar on the
fourteenth and fifteenth day of the same month with all diligence and
joy of the people gathered into one assembly throughout all the
generations hereafter of the people of israel
into the beginning of the book but was detached by st jerome and put
in this place
in the fourth year of the reign of ptolemy and cleopatra
in the second year of the reign of artaxerxes the great in the
first day of the month nisan mardochai the son of jair the son of
a jew who dwelt in the city of susan a great man and among the
first of the kings court had a dream
now he was of the number of the captives whom nabuchodonosor king
of babylon had carried away from jerusalem with jechonias king of juda
and this was his dream behold there were voices and tumults and
thunders and earthquakes and a disturbance upon the earth
and behold two great dragons came forth ready to fight one against
another
and at their cry all nations were stirred up to fight against the
nation of the just
and that was a day of darkness and danger of tribulation and
distress and great fear upon the earth
and the nation of the just was troubled fearing their own evils
and was prepared for death
and they cried to god and as they were crying a little fountain
grew into a very great river and abounded into many waters
the light and the sun rose up and the humble were exalted and
they devoured the glorious
and when mardochai had seen this and arose out of his bed he
was thinking what god would do and he kept it fixed in his mind
desirous to know what the dream should signify
and he abode at that time in the kings court with bagatha and
and when he understood their designs and had diligently searched
into their projects he learned that they went about to lay violent
hands on king artaxerxes and he told the king thereof
then the king had them both examined and after they had
confessed commanded them to be put to death
but the king made a record of what was done and mardochai also
committed the memory of the thing to writing
and the king commanded him to abide in the court of the palace
and gave him presents for the information
but aman the son of amadathi the bugite was in great honour with
the king and sought to hurt mardochai and his people because of the
two eunuchs of the king who were put to death
for the people
and this was the copy of the letter artaxerxes the great king who
reigneth from india to ethiopia to the princes and governors of the
hundred and twentyseven provinces that are subject to his empire
greeting
whereas i reigned over many nations and had brought all the world
under my dominion i was not willing to abuse the greatness of my power
but to govern my subjects with clemency and that they might live quietly
without any terror and might enjoy peace which is desired by all men
but when i asked my counsellors how this might be accomplished
one that excelled the rest in wisdom and fidelity and was second after
the king aman by name
told me that there was a people scattered through the whole world
which used new laws and acted against the customs of all nations
despised the commandments of kings and violated by their opposition the
concord of all nations
wherefore having learned this and seeing one nation in opposition
to all mankind using perverse laws and going against our commandments
and disturbing the peace and concord of the provinces subject to us
we have commanded that all whom aman shall mark out who is chief
over all the provinces and second after the king and whom we honour as
a father shall be utterly destroyed by their enemies with their wives
and children and that none shall have pity on them on the fourteenth
day of the twelfth month adar of this present year
that these wicked men going down to hell in one day may restore
to our empire the peace which they had disturbed
but mardochai besought the lord remembering all his works
and said o lord lord almighty king for all things are in thy
power and there is none that can resist thy will if thou determine to
save israel
thou hast made heaven and earth and all things that are under the
cope of heaven
thou art lord of all and there is none that can resist thy
majesty
thou knowest all things and thou knowest that it was not out of
pride and or any desire of glory that i refused to worship the proud
for i would willingly and readily for the salvation of israel
have kissed even the steps of his feet
but i feared lest i should transfer the honour of my god to a
man and lest i should adore any one except my god
and now o lord o king o god of abraham have mercy on thy
people because our enemies resolve to destroy us and extinguish thy
inheritance
despise not thy portion which thou hast redeemed for thyself out
of egypt
hear my supplication and be merciful to thy lot and inheritance
and turn our mourning into joy that we may live and praise thy name o
and all israel with like mind and supplication cried to the lord
because they saw certain death hanging over their heads
queen esther also fearing the danger that was at hand had
recourse to the lord
and when she had laid away her royal apparel she put on garments
suitable for weeping and mourning instead of divers precious ointments
she covered her head with ashes and dung and she humbled her body with
fasts and all the places in which before she was accustomed to rejoice
she filled with her torn hair
and she prayed to the lord the god of israel saying o my lord
who alone art our king help me a desolate woman and who have no other
helper but thee
my danger is in my hands
i have heard of my father that thou o lord didst take israel
from among all nations and our fathers from all their predecessors to
possess them as an everlasting inheritance and thou hast done to them
as thou hast promised
we have sinned in thy sight and therefore thou hast delivered us
into the hands of our enemies
for we have worshipped their gods thou art just o lord
and now they are not content to oppress us with most hard bondage
but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols
they design to change thy promises and destroy thy inheritance
and shut the mouths of them that praise thee and extinguish the glory
of thy temple and altar
that they may open the mouths of gentiles and praise the
strength of idols and magnify for ever a carnal king
give not o lord thy sceptre to them that are not lest they
laugh at our ruin but turn their counsel upon themselves and destroy
him that hath begun to rage against us
remember o lord and shew thyself to us in the time of our
tribulation and give me boldness o lord king of gods and of all
power
give me a well ordered speech in my mouth in the presence of the
lion and turn his heart to the hatred of our enemy that both he
himself may perish and the rest that consent to him
but deliver us by thy hand and help me who have no other
helper but thee o lord who hast the knowledge of all things
and thou knowest that i hate the glory of the wicked and abhor
the bed of the uncircumcised and of every stranger
thou knowest my necessity that i abominate the sign of my pride
and glory which is upon my head in the days of my public appearance
and detest it as a menstruous rag and wear it not in the days of my
silence
and that i have not eaten at amans table nor hath the kings
banquet pleased me and that i have not drunk the wine of the drink
offerings
and that thy handmaid hath never rejoiced since i was brought
hither unto this day but in thee o lord the god of abraham
o god who art mighty above all hear the voice of them that
have no other hope and deliver us from the hand of the wicked and
deliver me from my fear
his heart
and he commanded her no doubt but he was mardochai to go to the
king and petition for her people and for her country
remember said he the days of thy low estate how thou wast
brought up by my hand because aman the second after the king hath
spoken against us unto death
and do thou call upon the lord and speak to the king for us and
deliver us from death
and on the third day she laid away the garments she wore and put
on her glorious apparel
and glittering in royal robes after she had called upon god the
ruler and saviour of all she took two maids with her
and upon one of them she leaned as if for delicateness and
overmuch tenderness she were not able to bear up her own body
and the other maid followed her lady bearing up her train flowing
on the ground
but she with a rosy colour in her face and with gracious and
bright eyes hid a mind full of anguish and exceeding great fear
so going in she passed through all doors in order and stood
before the king where he sat upon his royal throne clothed with his
royal robes and glittering with gold and precious stones and he was
terrible to behold
and when he had lifted up his countenance and with burning eyes
had shewn the wrath of his heart the queen sunk down and her colour
turned pale and she rested her weary head upon her handmaid
and god changed the kings spirit into mildness and all in haste
and in fear he leaped from his throne and holding her up in his arms
till she came to herself caressed her with these words
what is the matter esther i am thy brother fear not
thou shalt not die for this law is not made for thee but for
all others
come near then and touch the sceptre
and as she held her peace he took the golden sceptre and laid
it upon her neck and kissed her and said why dost thou not speak to
me
she answered i saw thee my lord as an angel of god and my
heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty
for thou my lord art very admirable and thy face is full of
graces
and while she was speaking she fell down again and was almost
in a swoon
but the king was troubled and all his servants comforted her
the great king artaxerxes from india to ethiopia to the
governors and princes of a hundred and twentyseven provinces which
obey our command sendeth greeting
many have abused unto pride the goodness of princes and the
honour that hath been bestowed upon them
and not only endeavour to oppress the kings subjects but not
bearing the glory that is given them take in hand to practise also
against them that gave it
neither are they content not to return thanks for benefits
received and to violate in themselves the laws of humanity but they
think they can also escape the justice of god who seeth all things
and they break out into so great madness as to endeavour to
undermine by lies such as observe diligently the offices committed to
them and do all things in such manner as to be worthy of all mens
praise
while with crafty fraud they deceive the ears of princes that are
well meaning and judge of others by their own nature
now this is proved both from ancient histories and by the things
which are done daily how the good designs of kings are depraved by the
evil suggestions of certain men
wherefore we must provide for the peace of all provinces
neither must you think if we command different things that it
cometh of the levity of our mind but that we give sentence according to
the quality and necessity of times as the profit of the commonwealth
requireth
now that you may more plainly understand what we say aman the
son of amadathi a macedonian both in mind and country and having
nothing of the persian blood but with his cruelty staining our
goodness was received being a stranger by us
and found our humanity so great towards him that he was called
our father and was worshipped by all as the next man after the king
but he was so far puffed up with arrogancy as to go about to
deprive us of our kingdom and life
for with certain new and unheard of devices he hath sought the
destruction of mardochai by whose fidelity and good services our life
was saved and of esther the partner of our kingdom with all their
nation
thinking that after they were slain he might work treason
against us left alone without friends and might transfer the kingdom of
the persians to the macedonians
but we have found that the jews who were by that most wicked man
appointed to be slain are in no fault at all but contrariwise use
just laws
and are the children of the highest and the greatest and the
ever living god by whose benefit the kingdom was given both to our
fathers and to us and is kept unto this day
wherefore know ye that those letters which he sent in our name
are void and of no effect
for which crime both he himself that devised it and all his
kindred hang on gibbets before the gates of this city susan not we
but god repaying him as he deserved
but this edict which we now send shall be published in all
cities that the jews may freely follow their own laws
and you shall aid them that they may kill those who had prepared
themselves to kill them on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month
which is called adar
for the almighty god hath turned this day of sadness and mourning
into joy to them
wherefore you shall also count this day among other festival
days and celebrate it with all joy that it may be known also in times
to come
that all they who faithfully obey the persians receive a worthy
reward for their fidelity but they that are traitors to their kingdom
are destroyed for their wickedness
and let every province and city that will not be partaker of
this solemnity perish by the sword and by fire and be destroyed in
such manner as to be made unpassable both to men and beasts for an
example of contempt and disobedience
according to the more probable opinion was of the race of esau and the
same as jobab king of edom mentioned gen it is uncertain who
was the writer of it some attribute it to job himself others to moses
or some one of the prophets in the hebrew it is written in verse from
the beginning of the third chapter to the fortysecond chapter
