visions by which he puts them in hopes of better times
in the eighth month in the second year of king darius the word of
the lord came to zacharias the son of barachias the son of addo the
prophet saying
the lord hath been exceeding angry with your fathers
and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye
to me saith the lord of hosts and i will turn to you saith the lord
of hosts
be not as your fathers to whom the former prophets have cried
saying thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye from your evil ways and
from your wicked thoughts but they did not give ear neither did they
hearken to me saith the lord
your fathers where are they and the prophets shall they live
always
but yet my words and my ordinances which i gave in charge to my
servants the prophets did they not take hold of your fathers and they
returned and said as the lord of hosts thought to do to us according
to our ways and according to our devices so he hath done to us
in the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is called
i saw by night and behold a man riding upon a red horse and he
stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom and behind him
were horses red speckled and white
guardian angel of the church of god
and i said what are these my lord and the angel that spoke in
me said to me i will shew thee what these are
and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said
and they answered the angel of the lord that stood among the
myrtle trees and said we have walked through the earth and behold all
the earth is inhabited and is at rest
and the angel of the lord answered and said o lord of hosts how
long wilt thou not have mercy on jerusalem and on the cities of juda
with which thou hast been angry this is now the seventieth year
king darius these seventy years of the desolation of jerusalem and the
cities of juda are different from the seventy years of captivity
foretold by jeremias which began in the fourth year of joakim and
ended in the first year of king cyrus
and the lord answered the angel that spoke in me good words
comfortable words
and the angel that spoke in me said to me cry thou saying thus
saith the lord of hosts i am zealous for jerusalem and sion with a
great zeal
and i am angry with a great anger with the wealthy nations for i
was angry a little but they helped forward the evil
therefore thus saith the lord i will return to jerusalem in
mercies my house shall be built in it saith the lord of hosts and the
building line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem
cry yet saying thus saith the lord of hosts my cities shall yet
flow with good things and the lord will yet comfort sion and he will
yet choose jerusalem
and i lifted up my eyes and saw and behold four horns
persecute and oppress the kingdom of god
and i said to the angel that spoke in me what are these and he
said to me these are the horns that have scattered juda and israel
and jerusalem
and the lord shewed me four smiths
either represent those whom god makes his instruments in bringing to
nothing the power of persecutors
and i said what come these to do and he spoke saying these are
the horns which have scattered juda every man apart and none of them
lifted up his head and these are come to fray them to cast down the
horns of the nations that have lifted up the horn upon the land of juda
to scatter it
of christ by the conversion of some jews and many gentiles
and i lifted up my eyes and saw and behold a man with a
measuring line in his hand
and i said whither goest thou and he said to me to measure
the length thereof
and behold the angel that spoke in me went forth and another angel
went out to meet him
and he said to him run speak to this young man saying jerusalem
shall be inhabited without walls by reason of the multitude of men and
of the beasts in the midst thereof
the spiritual jerusalem the church of christ
and i will be to it saith the lord a wall of fire round about
and i will be in glory in the midst thereof
o o flee ye out of the land of the north saith the lord for i
have scattered you into the four winds of heaven saith the lord
o sion flee thou that dwellest with the daughter of babylon
for thus saith the lord of hosts after the glory he hath sent me
to the nations that have robbed you for he that toucheth you toucheth
the apple of my eye
for behold i lift up my hand upon them and they shall be a prey
to those that served them and you shall know that the lord of hosts
sent me
sing praise and rejoice o daughter of sion for behold i come
and i will dwell in the midst of thee saith the lord
and many nations shall be joined to the lord in that day and they
shall be my people and i will dwell in the midst of thee and thou
shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me to thee
and the lord shall possess juda his portion in the sanctified
land and he shall yet choose jerusalem
let all flesh be silent at the presence of the lord for he is
risen up out of his holy habitation
from his sins christ is promised and great fruit from his passion
and the lord shewed me jesus the high priest standing before the
angel of the lord and satan stood on his right hand to be his
adversary
and the lord said to satan the lord rebuke thee o satan and the
of the fire
and jesus was clothed with filthy garments and he stood before the
face of the angel
who answered and said to them that stood before him saying take
away the filthy garments from him and he said to him behold i have
taken away thy iniquity and have clothed thee with change of garments
and he said put a clean mitre upon his head and they put a clean
mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of the
and the angel of the lord protested to jesus saying
thus saith the lord of hosts if thou wilt walk in my ways and
keep my charge thou also shalt judge my house and shalt keep my
courts and i will give thee some of them that are now present here to
walk with thee
hear o jesus thou high priest thou and thy friends that dwell
before thee for they are portending men for behold i will bring my
wonders that are to comeibid my servant the orient christ who
according to his humanity is the servant of god is called the orient
from his rising like the sun in the east to enlighten the world
for behold the stone that i have laid before jesus upon one stone
there are seven eyes behold i will grave the graving thereof saith the
day
stone of his churchibid seven eyes the manifold providence of
good when this precious stone shall be graved that is cut and
pierced with whips thorns nails and spear
in that day saith the lord of hosts every man shall call his
friend under the vine and under the fig tree
olive trees
and the angel that spoke in me came again and he waked me as a
man that is wakened out of his sleep
and he said to me what seest thou and i said i have looked and
behold a candlestick all of gold and its lamp upon the top of it and
the seven lights thereof upon it and seven funnels for the lights that
were upon the top thereof
in a more sublime sense the church of christ
and two olive trees over it one upon the right side of the lamp
and the other upon the left side thereof
and i answered and said to the angel that spoke in me saying
and the angel that spoke in me answered and said to me knowest
thou not what these things are and i said no my lord
and he answered and spoke to me saying this is the word of the
spirit saith the lord of hosts
success in the building of the temple which he had begun signified by
the candlestick the lamp of which without any other industry was
supplied with oil dropping from the two olive trees and distributed by
the seven funnels or pipes to maintain the seven lights
who art thou o great mountain before zorobabel thou shalt become
a plain and he shall bring out the chief stone and shall give equal
grace to the grace thereof
side was quashed by divine providenceibid shall give equal grace
etc shall add grace to grace or beauty to beauty
and the word of the lord came to me saying
the hands of zorobabel have laid the foundations of this house and
his hands shall finish it and you shall know that the lord of hosts
hath sent me to you
for who hath despised little days and they shall rejoice and
shall see the tin plummet in the hand of zorobabel these are the seven
eyes of the lord that run to and fro through the whole earth
of godibid the tin plummet literally the stone of tin he means
the builders plummet which zorobabel shall hold in his hand for the
finishing the buildingibid the seven eyes the providence of god
that oversees and orders all things
and i answered and said to him what are these two olive trees
upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof
and i answered again and said to him what are the two olive
branches that are by the two golden beaks in which are the funnels of
gold
and he spoke to me saying knowest thou not what these are and i
said no my lord
and he said these are two sons of oil who stand before the lord
of the whole earth
and i turned and lifted up my eyes and i saw and behold a volume
flying
books which from being rolled up were called volumes
and he said to me what seest thou and i said i see a volume
flying the length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth thereof ten
cubits
and he said to me this is the curse that goeth forth over the face
of the earth for every thief shall be judged as is there written and
every one that sweareth in like manner shall be judged by it
i will bring it forth saith the lord of hosts and it shall come
to the house of the thief and to the house of him that sweareth falsely
by my name and it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall
consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof
and the angel went forth that spoke in me and he said to me lift
up thy eyes and see what this is that goeth forth
and i said what is it and he said this is a vessel going forth
resemblance and figure of them viz of sinners
and behold a talent of lead was carried and behold a woman sitting
in the midst of the vessel
and he said this is wickedness and he cast her into the midst of
the vessel and cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof
and i lifted up my eyes and looked and behold there came out two
women and wind was in their wings and they had wings like the wings of
a kite and they lifted up the vessel between the earth and the heaven
and i said to the angel that spoke in me whither do these carry
the vessel
and he said to me that a house may be built for it in the land of
basis
note that babylon in holy writ is often taken for the city of the
devil that is for the whole congregation of the wicked as jerusalem
is taken for the city and people of god
priest as a type of christ
and i turned and lifted up my eyes and saw and behold four
chariots came out from the midst of two mountains and the mountains
were mountains of brass
the kings of egypt and of asia the descendants of ptolemeus and
in the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot
black horses
and in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot
grisled horses and strong ones
and i answered and said to the angel that spoke in me what are
these my lord
and the angel answered and said to me these are the four winds of
the heaven which go forth to stand before the lord of all the earth
that in which were the black horses went forth into the land of the
north and the white went forth after them and the grisled went forth
to the land the south
north in respect of jerusalem the black horses that is the medes and
white horses went thither because they conquered babylon executed upon
it the judgments of god which is signified ver by the expression
of quieting his spiritibid the land of the south egypt which lay
to the south of jerusalem and was occupied first by ptolemeus and then
by the romans
and they that were most strong went out and sought to go and to
run to and fro through all the earth and he said go walk throughout
the earth and they walked throughout the earth
and he called me and spoke to me saying behold they that go
forth into the land of the north have quieted my spirit in the land of
the north
and the word of the lord came to me saying
take of them of the captivity of holdai and of tobias and of
and thou shalt take gold and silver and shalt make crowns and
thou shalt set them on the head of jesus the son of josedec the high
priest
and thou shalt speak to him saying thus saith the lord of hosts
saying behold a man the orient is his name and under him shall he
spring up a shall build a temple to the lord
yea he shall build a temple to the lord and he shall bear the
glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest
upon his throne and the counsel of peace shall be between them both
or dignities of king and priest
and the crowns shall be to helem and tobias and idaias and to
and they that are far off shall come and shall build in the
temple of the lord and you shall know that the lord of hosts sent me to
you but this shall come to pass if hearing you will hear the voice of
the lord your god
sin
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king darius that the
word of the lord came to zacharias in the fourth day of the ninth
month which is casleu
when sarasar and rogommelech and the men that were with him sent
to the house of god to entreat the face of the lord
to speak to the priests of the house of the lord of hosts and to
the prophets saying must i weep in the fifth month or must i sanctify
myself as i have now done for many years
because on that day the temple was burnt therefore they inquire whether
they are to continue the fast after the temple is rebuilt see this
query answered in the th verse of the following chapter
and the word of the lord of hosts came to me saying
speak to all the people of the land and to the priests saying
these seventy years did you keep a fast unto me
and when you did eat and drink did you not eat for yourselves and
drink for yourselves
are not these the words which the lord spoke by the hand of the
former prophets when jerusalem as yet was inhabited and was wealthy
both itself and the cities round about it and there were inhabitants
towards the south and in the plain
and the word of the lord came to zacharias saying
thus saith the lord of hosts saying judge ye true judgment and
shew ye mercy and compassion every man to his brother
and oppress not the widow and the fatherless and the stranger
and the poor and let not a man devise evil in his heart against his
brother
but they would not hearken and they turned away the shoulder to
depart and they stopped their ears not to hear
and they made their heart as the adamant stone lest they should
hear the law and the words which the lord of hosts sent in his spirit
by the hand of the former prophets so a great indignation came from
and it came to pass that as he spoke and they heard not so shall
they cry and i will not hear saith the lord of hosts
and i dispersed them throughout all kingdoms which they know not
and the land was left desolate behind them so that no man passed
through or returned and they changed the delightful land into a
wilderness
and the word of the lord of hosts came to me saying
thus saith the lord of hosts i have been jealous for sion with a
great jealousy and with a great indignation have i been jealous for
her
thus saith the lord of hosts i am returned to sion and i will
dwell in the midst of jerusalem and jerusalem shall be called the city
of truth and the mountain of the lord of hosts the sanctified
mountain
thus saith the lord of hosts there shall yet old men and old women
dwell in the streets of jerusalem and every man with his staff in his
hand through multitude of days
and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
playing in the streets thereof
thus saith the lord of hosts if it seem hard in the eyes of the
remnant of this people in those days shall it be hard in my eyes saith
the lord of hosts
thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will save my people from the
land of the east and from the land of the going down of the sun
and i will bring them and they shall dwell in the midst of
and in justice
thus saith the lord of hosts let your hands be strengthened you
that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets in the
day that the house of the lord of hosts was founded that the temple
might be built
for before those days there was no hire for men neither was there
hire for beasts neither was there peace to him that came in nor to him
that went out because of the tribulation and i let all men go every
one against his neighbour
but now i will not deal with the remnant of this people according
to the former days saith the lord of hosts
but there shall be the seed of peace the vine shall yield her
fruit and the earth shall give her increase and the heavens shall give
their dew and i will cause the remnant of this people to possess all
these things
and it shall come to pass that as you were a curse among the
you shall be a blessing fear not let your hands be strengthened
for thus saith the lord of hosts as i purposed to afflict you
when your fathers had provoked me to wrath saith the lord
and i had no mercy so turning again i have thought in these days
to do good to the house of juda and jerusalem fear not
these then are the things which you shall do speak ye truth
every one to his neighbour judge ye truth and judgment of peace in your
gates
and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
friend and love not a false oath for all these are the things that i
hate saith the lord
and the word of the lord of hosts came to me saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the fast of the fourth month and
the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the
tenth shall be to the house of juda joy and gladness and great
solemnities only love ye truth and peace
the fourth month because on that day nabuchodonosor took jerusalem
temple was burnt jer on the third day of the seventh month for
the murder of godolias jer and on the tenth day of the tenth
month because on that day the chaldeans began to besiege jerusalem
shall be changed as is here promised into joyful solemnities
thus saith the lord of hosts until people come and dwell in many
cities
and the inhabitants go one to another saying let us go and
entreat the face of the lord and let us seek the lord of hosts i also
will go
and many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the lord
of hosts in jerusalem and to entreat the face of the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts in those days wherein ten men of
all languages of the gentiles shall take hold and shall hold fast the
skirt of one that is a jew saying we will go with you for we have
heard that god is with you
religion before christ but many more were converted to christ by the
apostles and other preachers of the jewish nation
faith the meek coming of christ to bring peace to deliver the
captives by his blood and to give us all good things
the burden of the word of the lord in the land of hadrach and of
emath also in the borders thereof and tyre and sidon for they
have taken to themselves to be exceeding wise
and tyre hath built herself a strong hold and heaped together
silver as earth and gold as the mire of the streets
behold the lord shall possess her and shall strike her strength in
the sea and she shall be devoured with fire
ascalon shall see and shall fear and gaza and shall be very
sorrowful and accaron because her hope is confounded and the king
shall perish from gaza and ascalon shall not be inhabited
and the divider shall sit in azotus and i will destroy the pride
of the philistines
and i will take away his blood out of his mouth and his
abominations from between his teeth and even he shall be left to our
conversion of that people from their bloody sacrifices and abominations
to the worship of the true god
and i will encompass my house with them that serve me in war going
and returning and the oppressor shall no more pass through them for
now i have seen with my eyes
rejoice greatly o daughter of sion shout for joy o daughter of
is poor and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass
and i will destroy the chariot out of ephraim and the horse out
of jerusalem and the bow for war shall be broken and he shall speak
peace to the gentiles and his power shall be from sea to sea and from
the rivers even to the end of the earth
thou also by the blood of thy testament hast sent forth thy
prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water
return to the strong hold ye prisoners of hope i will render
thee double as i declare today
because i have bent juda for me as a bow i have filled ephraim
and i will raise up thy sons o sion above thy sons o greece and i
will make thee as the sword of the mighty
conquered the greeks and subdued them to christ
and the lord god shall be seen over them and his dart shall go
forth as lightning and the lord god will sound the trumpet and go in
the whirlwind of the south
the lord of hosts will protect them and they shall devour and
subdue with the stones of the sling and drinking they shall be
inebriated as it were with wine and they shall be filled as bowls and
as the horns of the altar
and the lord their god will save them in that day as the flock of
his people for holy stones shall be lifted up over his land
the church
for what is the good thing of him and what is his beautiful
thing but the corn of the elect and wine springing forth virgins
called here the corn that is the bread of the elect and the wine
springing forth virgins that is maketh virgins to bud or spring
forth as it were like flowers among thorns because it has a wonderful
efficacy to give and preserve purity
which shall arise originally from the jewish nation
ask ye of the lord rain in the latter season and the lord will
make snows and will give them showers of rain to every one grass in
the field
for the idols have spoken what was unprofitable and the diviners
have seen a lie and the dreamers have spoken vanity they comforted in
vain therefore they were led away as a flock they shall be afflicted
because they have no shepherd
my wrath is kindled against the shepherds and i will visit upon
the buck goats for the lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house
of juda and hath made them as the horse of his glory in the battle
out of him shall come forth the corner out of him the pin out of
him the bow of battle out of him ever exacter together
and they shall be as mighty men treading under foot the mire of
the ways in battle and they shall fight because the lord is with them
and the riders of horses shall be confounded
and i will strengthen the house of juda and save the house of
them and they shall be as they were when i had not cast them off for i
am the lord their god and will hear them
and they shall be as the valiant men of ephraim and their heart
shall rejoice as through wine and their children shall see and shall
rejoice and their heart shall be joyful in the lord
i will whistle for them and i will gather them together because
before
and i will sow them among peoples and from afar they shall
remember me and they shall live with their children and shall return
and i will bring them back out of the land of egypt and i will
gather them from among the assyrians and will bring them to the land of
and he shall pass over the strait of the sea and shall strike
the waves in the sea and all the depths of the river shall be
confounded and the pride of assyria shall be humbled and the sceptre
of egypt shall depart
i will strengthen them in the lord and they shall walk in his
name saith the lord
open thy gates o libanus and let fire devour thy cedars
by the prophets from its height and from its being built of the cedars
of libanusibid thy cedars thy princes and chief men
howl thou fir tree for the cedar is fallen for the mighty are
laid waste howl ye oaks of basan because the fenced forest is cut
down
the voice of the howling of the shepherds because their glory is
laid waste the voice of the roaring of the lions because the pride of
the jordan is spoiled
thus saith the lord my god feed the flock of the slaughter
which they that possessed slew and repented not and they sold
them saying blessed be the lord we are become rich and their
shepherds spared them not
and i will no more spare the inhabitants of the land saith the
hand and into the hand of his king and they shall destroy the land
and i will not deliver it out of their hand
siege of jerusalem in which the different factions of the jews
destroyed one another and they that remained fell into the hands of
their king that is of the roman emperor of whom they had said john
we have no king but caesar
and i will feed the flock of slaughter for this o ye poor of the
flock and i took unto me two rods one i called beauty and the other i
called a cord and i fed the flock
dealing with his people the one by sweet means called the rod of
both these rods are made of no use or effect by the obstinacy of
sinners the rods are broken and such sinners are given up to a
reprobate sense as the jews were
and i cut off three shepherds in one month and my soul was
straitened in their regard for their soul also varied in my regard
three shepherds probably are meant the latter princes and high priests
of the jews whose reign was short
and i said i will not feed you that which dieth let it die and
that which is cut off let it be cut off and let the rest devour every
one the flesh of his neighbour
and i took my rod that was called beauty and i cut it asunder to
make void my covenant which i had made with all people
and it was made void in that day and so the poor of the flock
that keep for me understood that it is the word of the lord
and i said to them if it be good in your eyes bring hither my
wages and if not be quiet and they weighed for my wages thirty pieces
of silver
and the lord said to me cast it to the statuary a handsome
price that i was prized at by them and i took the thirty pieces of
silver and i cast them into the house of the lord to the statuary
and i cut off my second rod that was called a cord that i might
break the brotherhood between juda and israel
and the lord said to me take to thee yet the instruments of a
foolish shepherd
wicked princes and priests that should rule the people before their
utter desolation
for behold i will raise up a shepherd in the land who shall not
visit what is forsaken nor seek what is scattered nor heal what is
broken nor nourish that which standeth and he shall eat the flesh of
the fat ones and break their hoofs
o shepherd and idol that forsaketh the flock the sword upon
his arm and upon his right eye his arm shall quite wither away and his
right eye shall be utterly darkened
the burden of the word of the lord upon israel thus saith the
the earth and formeth the spirit of man in him
behold i will make jerusalem a lintel of surfeiting to all the
people round about and juda also shall be in the siege against
enter to glut themselves with blood but they shall stumble and fall
like men stupefied with wine it seems to allude to the times of
and it shall come to pass in that day that i will make jerusalem
a burdensome stone to all people all that shall lift it up shall be
rent and torn and all the kingdoms of the earth shall be gathered
together against her
in that day saith the lord i will strike every horse with
astonishment and his rider with madness and i will open my eyes upon
the house of juda and will strike every horse of the nations with
blindness
and the governors of juda shall say in their heart let the
inhabitants of jerusalem be strengthened for me in the lord of hosts
their god
in that day i will make the governors of juda like a furnace of
fire amongst wood and as a firebrand amongst hay and they shall devour
all the people round about to the right hand and to the left and
and the lord shall save the tabernacles of jada as in the
beginning that the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of
in that day shall the lord protect the inhabitants of jerusalem
and he that hath offended among them in that day shall be as david and
the house of david as that of god as an angel of the lord in their
sight
and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy
all the nations that come against jerusalem
and i will pour out upon the house of david and upon the
inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of prayers and they
shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him
as one mourneth for an only son and they shall grieve over him as the
manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn
in that day there shall be a great lamentation in jerusalem like
the lamentation of adadremmon in the plain of mageddon
slain and much lamented by his people
and the land shall mourn families and families apart the
families of the house of david apart and their women apart
the families of the house of nathan apart and their women apart
the families of the house of levi apart and their women apart the
families of semei apart and their women apart
all the rest of the families families and families apart and
their women apart
in that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of david
and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for the washing of the sinner and
of the unclean woman
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts
that i will destroy the names of idols out of the earth and they shall
be remembered no more and i will take away the false prophets and the
unclean spirit out of the earth
and it shall come to pass that when any man shall prophesy any
more his father and his mother that brought him into the world shall
say to him thou shalt not live because thou hast spoken a lie in the
name of the lord and his father and his mother his parents shall
thrust him through when he shall prophesy
and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be
confounded every one by his own vision when he shall prophesy neither
shall they be clad with a garment of sackcloth to deceive
but he shall say i am no prophet i am a husbandman for adam is
my example from my youth
and they shall say to him what are these wounds in the midst of
thy hands and he shall say with these i was wounded in the house of
them that loved me
awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that
cleaveth to me saith the lord of hosts strike the shepherd and the
sheep shall be scattered and i will turn my hand to the little ones
and there shall be in all the earth saith the lord two parts in
it shall be scattered and shall perish but the third part shall be
left therein
and i will bring the third part through the fire and will refine
them as silver is refined and i will try them as gold is tried they
shall call on my name and i will hear them i will say thou art my
people and they shall say the lord is my god
his church
behold the days of the lord shall come and thy spoils shall be
divided in the midst of thee
and i will gather all nations to jerusalem to battle and the city
shall be taken and the houses shall be rifled and the women shall be
defiled and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the
rest of the people shall not be taken away out of the city
then the lord shall go forth and shall fight against those
nations as when he fought in the day of battle
and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives
which is over against jerusalem towards the east and the mount of
west with a very great opening and half of the mountain shall be
separated to the north and half thereof to the south
and you shall flee to the valley of those mountains for the
valley of the mountains shall be joined even to the next and you shall
flee as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the days of ozias
king of juda and the lord my god shall come and all the saints with
him
and it shall come to pass in that day that there shall be no
light but cold and frost
it was neither day nor night ver because they neither had the
comfortable light of the day nor the repose of the night
and there shall be one day which is known to the lord not day
nor night and in the time of the evening there shall be light
shall arise by the means of the machabees when things shalll seem to be
at the worst
and it shall come to pass in that day that living waters shall go
out from jerusalem half of them to the east sea and half of them to
the last sea they shall be in summer and in winter
and the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day there
shall be one lord and his name shall be one
and all the land shall return even to the desert from the hill
to remmon to the south of jerusalem and she shall be exalted and shall
dwell in her own place from the gate of benjamin even to the place of
the former gate and even to the gate of the corners and from the tower
of hananeel even to the kings winepresses
the means of the machabees but is rather to be taken in a spiritual
sense as relating to the propagation of the church and kingdom of
anathema of destruction or gods curse
and people shall dwell in it and there shall be no more an
anathema but jerusalem shall sit secure
and this shall be the plague wherewith the lord shall strike all
nations that have fought against jerusalem the flesh of every one shall
consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall
consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away in
their mouth
have often fallen upon the persecutors of gods church as appears by
many instances in history
in that day there shall be a great tumult from the lord among
them and a man shall take the hand of his neighbour and his hand shall
be clasped upon his neighbours hand
and even juda shall fight against jerusalem and the riches of
all nations round about shall be gathered together gold and silver
and garments in great abundance
in persecuting the church
and the destruction of the horse and of the mule and of the
camel and of the ass and of all the beasts that shall be in those
tents shall be like this destruction
as well as the men the common soldiers as well as their leaders
and all they that shall be left of all nations that came against
hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles
the church shall be converted to its faith and communionibid to keep
the feast of tabernacles this feast was kept by the jews in memory of
their sojourning forty years in the desert in their way to the land of
promise and in the spiritual sense is duly kept by all such christians
as in their earthly pilgrimage are continually advancing toward their
true home the heavenly jerusalem by the help of the sacraments and
sacrifice of the church and they that neglect this must not look for
the kind showers of divine grace to give fruitfulness to their souls
and it shall come to pass that he that shall not go up of the
families of the land to jerusalem to adore the king the lord of hosts
there shall be no rain upon them
and if the family of egypt go not up nor come neither shall it
be upon them but there shall be destruction wherewith the lord will
strike all nations that will not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles
this shall be the sin of egypt and this the sin of all nations
that will not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles
in that day that which is upon the bridle of the horse shall be
holy to the lord and the caldrons in the house of the lord shall be as
the phials before the altar
bridles etc shall be turned into offerings in the house of god and
there shall be an abundance of caldrons and phials for the sacrifices of
the temple by which is meant under a figure the great resort there
shall be to the temple that is to the church of christ and her
sacrifice
and every caldron in jerusalem and juda shall be sanctified to
the lord of hosts and all that sacrifice shall come and take of them
and shall seethe in them and the merchant shall be no more in the house
of the lord of hosts in that day
shall have no title to be in the house of the lord or there shall be no
occasion for buyers or sellers of oxen or sheep or doves in the house
of god such as jesus christ cast out of the temple
with nehemias and by some is believed to have been the same person as
flourished about four hundred years before christ he foretells the
coming of christ the reprobation of the jews and their sacrifices and
the calling of the gentiles who shall offer up to god in every place an
acceptable sacrifice
