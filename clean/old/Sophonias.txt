judgment
the word of the lord that came to sophonias the son of chusi the
son of godolias the son of amarias the son of ezechias in the days of
gathering i will gather together all things from off the face of
the land saith the lord
and wholly consume either by captivity or death both men and beasts
out of this land
i will gather man and beast i will gather the birds of the air
and the fishes of the sea and the ungodly shall meet with ruin and i
will destroy men from off the face of the land saith the lord
and i will stretch out my hand upon juda and upon all the
inhabitants of jerusalem and i will destroy out of this place the
remnant of baal and the names of the wardens of the temples with the
priests
incense
and them that worship the host of heaven upon the tops of houses
and them that adore and swear by the lord and swear by melchom
and them that turn away from following after the lord and that
have not sought the lord nor searched after him
be silent before the face of the lord god for the day of the lord
is near for the lord hath prepared a victim he hath sanctified his
guests
and it shall come to pass in the day of the victim of the lord
that i will visit upon the princes and upon the kings sons and upon
all such as are clothed with strange apparel
and i will visit in that day upon every one that entereth
arrogantly over the threshold them that fill the house of the lord
their god with iniquity and deceit
and there shall be in that day saith the lord the noise of a cry
from the fish gate and a howling from the second and a great
destruction from the hills
howl ye inhabitants of the morter all the people of chanaan is
hush all are cut off that were wrapped up in silver
of chanaan so he calls the jews from their following the wicked ways
of the chanaanites
and it shall come to pass at that time that i will search
their lees that say in their hearts the lord will not do good nor
will he do evil
ease resting upon their riches like wine upon the lees
and their strength shall become a booty and their houses as a
desert and they shall build houses and shall not dwell in them and
they shall plant vineyards and shall not drink the wine of them
the great day of the lord is near it is near and exceeding swift
the voice of the day of the lord is bitter the mighty man shall there
meet with tribulation
that day is a day of wrath a day of tribulation and distress a
day of calamity and misery a day of darkness and obscurity a day of
clouds and whirlwinds
a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities and
against the high bulwarks
and i will distress men and they shall walk like blind men
because they have sinned against the lord and their blood shall be
poured out as earth and their bodies as dung
neither shall their silver and their gold be able to deliver them
in the day of the wrath of the lord all the land shall be devoured by
the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy destruction of
all them that dwell in the land
assemble yourselves together be gathered together o nation not
worthy to be loved
before the decree bring forth the day as dust passing away before
the fierce anger of the lord come upon you before the day of the lords
indignation come upon you
seek the lord all ye meek of the earth you that have wrought his
judgment seek the just seek the meek if by any means you may be hid
in the day of the lords indignation
for gaza shall be destroyed and ascalon shall be a desert they
shall cast out azotus at noonday and accaron shall be rooted up
woe to you that inhabit the sea coast o nation of reprobates the
word of the lord upon you o chanaan the land of the philistines and i
will destroy thee so that there shall not be an inhabitant
and the sea coast shall be the resting place of shepherds and
folds for cattle
and it shall be the portion of him that shall remain of the house
of juda there they shall feed in the houses of ascalon they shall rest
in the evening because the lord their god will visit them and bring
back their captivity
i have heard the reproach of moab and the blasphemies of the
children of ammon with which they reproached my people and have
magnified themselves upon their borders
therefore as i live saith the lord of hosts the god of israel
dryness of thorns and heaps of salt and a desert even for ever the
remnant of my people shall make a spoil of them and the residue of my
nation shall possess them
this shall befall them for their pride because they have
blasphemed and have been magnified against the people of the lord of
hosts
the lord shall be terrible upon them and shall consume all the
gods of the earth and they shall adore him every man from his own
place all the islands of the gentiles
you ethiopians also shall be slain with my sword
and he will stretch out his hand upon the north and will destroy
place not passable and as a desert
viz in the sixteenth year of the reign of josias
and flocks shall lie down in the midst thereof all the beasts of
the nations and the bittern and the urchin shall lodge in the threshold
thereof the voice of the singing bird in the window the raven on the
upper post for i will consume her strength
this is the glorious city that dwelt in security that said in her
heart i am and there is none beside me how is she become a desert a
place for beasts to lie down in every one that passeth by her shall
hiss and wag his hand
shall be converted at last
woe to the provoking and redeemed city the dove
she hath not hearkened to the voice neither hath she received
discipline she hath not trusted in the lord she drew not near to her
her princes are in the midst of her as roaring lions her judges
are evening wolves they left nothing for the morning
her prophets are senseless men without faith her priests have
polluted the sanctuary they have acted unjustly against the law
the just lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity in
the morning in the morning he will bring his judgment to light and it
shall not be hid but the wicked man hath not known shame
i have destroyed the nations and their towers are beaten down i
have made their ways desert so that there is none that passeth by
their cities are desolate there is not a man remaining nor any
inhabitant
i said surely thou wilt fear me thou wilt receive correction and
her dwelling shall not perish for all things wherein i have visited
her but they rose early and corrupted all their thoughts
wherefore expect me saith the lord in the day of my resurrection
that is to come for my judgment is to assemble the gentiles and to
gather the kingdoms and to pour upon them my indignation all my fierce
anger for with the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be devoured
because then i will restore to the people a chosen lip that all
may call upon the name of the lord and may serve him with one shoulder
from beyond the rivers of ethiopia shall my suppliants the
children of my dispersed people bring me an offering
in that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein
thou hast transgressed against me for then i will take away out of the
midst of thee thy proud boasters and thou shalt no more be lifted up
because of my holy mountain
and i will leave in the midst of thee a poor and needy people and
they shall hope in the name of the lord
the remnant of israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies nor
shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed
and shall lie down and there shall be none to make them afraid
give praise o daughter of sion shout o israel be glad and
rejoice with all thy heart o daughter of jerusalem
the lord hath taken away thy judgment he hath turned away thy
enemies the king of israel the lord is in the midst of thee thou
shalt fear evil no more
in that day it shall be said to jerusalem fear not to sion let
not thy hands be weakened
the lord thy god in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he
will rejoice over thee with gladness he will be silent in his love he
will be joyful over thee in praise
the triflers that were departed from the law i will gather
together because they were of thee that thou mayest no more suffer
reproach for them
behold i will cut off all that have afflicted thee at that time
and i will save her that halteth and will gather her that was cast out
and i will get them praise and a name in all the land where they had
been put to confusion
at that time when i will bring you and at the time that i will
gather you for i will give you a name and praise among all the people
of the earth when i shall have brought back your captivity before your
eyes saith the lord
the first year of the reign of king cyrus he was sent by the lord in
the second year of the reign of king darius the son of hystaspes to
exhort zorobabel the prince of juda and jesus the high priest to the
building of the temple which they had begun but left off again through
the opposition of the samaritans in consequence of this exhortation
they proceeded in the building and finished the temple and the prophet
was commissioned by the lord to assure them that this second temple
should be more glorious than the former because the messiah should
honour it with his presence signifying withal how much the church of
the new testament should excel that of the old testament
