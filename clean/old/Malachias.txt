offering pure sacrifices he will accept of the sacrifice that shall be
offered in every place among the gentiles
the burden of the word of the lord to israel by the hand of
i have loved you saith the lord and you have said wherein hast
thou loved us was not esau brother to jacob saith the lord and i have
loved jacob
my chosen people and to lead them with my blessings without any merit
on their part and though they have been always ungrateful whilst i
have rejected esau and executed severe judgments upon his posterity
that by his free election and grace he loved jacob and favoured his
posterity above their deserts see the annotations upon rom
but have hated esau and i have made his mountains a wilderness
and given his inheritance to the dragons of the desert
but if edom shall say we are destroyed but we will return and
build up what hath been destroyed thus saith the lord of hosts they
shall build up and i will throw down and they shall be called the
borders of wickedness and the people with whom the lord is angry for
ever
and your eyes shall see and you shall say the lord be magnified
upon the border of israel
the son honoureth the father and the servant his master if then i
be a father where is my honour and if i be a master where is my
fear saith the lord of hosts
to you o priests that despise my name and have said wherein
have we despised thy name you offer polluted bread upon my altar and
you say wherein have we polluted thee in that you say the table of
the lord is contemptible
if you offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if you
offer the lame and the sick is it not evil offer it to thy prince if
he will be pleased with it or if he will regard thy face saith the
and now beseech ye the face of god that he may have mercy on you
for by your hand hath this been done if by any means he will receive
your faces saith the lord of hosts
who is there among you that will shut the doors and will kindle
the fire on my altar gratis i have no pleasure in you saith the lord
of hosts and i will not receive a gift of your hand
for from the rising of the sun even to the going down my name is
great among the gentiles and in every place there is sacrifice and
there is offered to my name a clean oblation for my name is great among
the gentiles saith the lord of hosts
eucharistic sacrifice
and you have profaned it in that you say the table of the lord is
defiled and that which is laid thereupon is contemptible with the fire
that devoureth it
and you have said behold of our labour and you puffed it away
saith the lord of hosts and you brought in of rapine the lame and the
sick and brought in an offering shall i accept it at your hands saith
the lord
you brought your offering and so made it of no value by offering it
with an evil mind moreover what you offered was both defective in
itself and gotten by rapine and extortion
cursed is the deceitful man that hath in his flock a male and
making a vow offereth in sacrifice that which is feeble to the lord for
among the gentiles
of marrying with idolaters and too easily putting away their wives
and now o ye priests this commandment is to you
if you will not hear and if you will not lay it to heart to give
glory to my name saith the lord of hosts i will send poverty upon you
and will curse your blessings yea i will curse them because you have
not laid it to heart
behold i will cast the shoulder to you and will scatter upon your
face the dung of your solemnities and it shall take you away with it
in the law was appointed to be your portion and fling it at you in my
anger and will reject both you and your festivals like dung
and you shall know that i sent you this commandment that my
covenant might be with levi saith the lord of hosts
my covenant was with him of life and peace and i gave him fear
and he feared me and he was afraid before my name
the law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in
his lips he walked with me in peace and in equity and turned many
away from iniquity
for the lips of the priests shall keep knowledge and they shall
seek the law at his mouth because he is the angel of the lord of hosts
but you have departed out of the way and have caused many to
stumble at the law you have made void the covenant of levi saith the
therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before all
people as you have not kept my ways and have accepted persons in the
law
have we not all one father hath not one god created us why then
doth every one of us despise his brother violating the covenant of our
fathers
juda hath transgressed and abomination hath been committed in
the lord will cut off the man that hath done this both the
master and the scholar out of the tabernacles of jacob and him that
offereth an offering to the lord of hosts
and this again have you done you have covered the altar of the
regard to sacrifice neither do i accept any atonement at your hands
and who came to weep and lament before the altar
and you have said for what cause because the lord hath been
witness between thee and the wife of thy youth whom thou hast
despised yet she was thy partner and the wife of thy covenant
did not one make her and she is the residue of his spirit and
what doth one seek but the seed of god keep then your spirit and
despise not the wife of thy youth
when thou shalt hate her put her away saith the lord the god of
keep your spirit and despise not
his wife without just cause notwithstanding that god permitted it in
the law to prevent the evil of murder
you have wearied the lord with your words and you said wherein
have we wearied him in that you say every one that doth evil is good
in the sight of the lord and such please him or surely where is the
continue in their evil ways shall be punished but true penitents shall
receive a blessing
behold i send my angel and he shall prepare the way before my
face and presently the lord whom you seek and the angel of the
testament whom you desire shall come to his temple behold he cometh
saith the lord of hosts
of christ
and who shall be able to think of the day of his coming and who
shall stand to see him for he is like a refining fire and like the
fullers herb
and he shall sit refining and cleansing the silver and he shall
purify the sons of levi and shall refine them as gold and as silver
and they shall offer sacrifices to the lord in justice
and the sacrifice of juda and of jerusalem shall please the lord
as in the days of old and in the ancient years
and i will come to you in judgment and will be a speedy witness
against sorcerers and adulterers and false swearers and them that
oppress the hireling in his wages the widows and the fatherless and
oppress the stranger and have not feared me saith the lord of hosts
for i am the lord and i change not and you the sons of jacob are
not consumed
for from the days of your fathers you have departed from my
ordinances and have not kept them return to me and i will return to
you saith the lord of hosts and you have said wherein shall we
return
shall a man afflict god for you afflict me and you have said
and you are cursed with want and you afflict me even the whole
nation of you
bring all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat
in my house and try me in this saith the lord if i open not unto you
the floodgates of heaven and pour you out a blessing even to
abundance
and i will rebuke for your sakes the devourer and he shall not
spoil the fruit of your land neither shall the vine in the field be
barren saith the lord of hosts
and all nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a
delightful land saith the lord of hosts
your words have been unsufferable to me saith the lord
and you have said what have we spoken against thee you have
said he laboureth in vain that serveth god and what profit is it that
we have kept his ordinances and that we have walked sorrowful before
the lord of hosts
wherefore now we call the proud people happy for they that work
wickedness are built up and they have tempted god and are preserved
then they that feared the lord spoke every one with his
neighbour and the lord gave ear and heard it and a book of
remembrance was written before him for them that fear the lord and
think on his name
and they shall be my special possession saith the lord of hosts
in the day that i do judgment and i will spare them as a man spareth
his son that serveth him
and you shall return and shall see the difference between the
just and the wicked and between him that serveth god and him that
serveth him not
observe the law elias shall come for the conversion of the jews
for behold the day shall come kindled as a furnace and all the
proud and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that
cometh shall set them on fire saith the lord of hosts it shall not
leave them root nor branch
but unto you that fear my name the sun of justice shall arise and
health in his wings and you shall go forth and shall leap like calves
of the herd
and you shall tread down the wicked when they shall be ashes under
the sole of your feet in the day that i do this saith the lord of
hosts
remember the law of moses my servant which i commanded him in
behold i will send you elias the prophet before the coming of the
great and dreadful day of the lord
and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the
heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and strike the
earth with anathema
of christ he shall reconcile them to their fathers viz the
partiarchs and prophets whose hearts for many ages have been turned
away from them because of their refusing to believe in christibid
people of god under the command of judas machabeus and his brethren and
he as some will have it was surnamed machabeus from carrying in his
ensigns or standards those words of exodus who is like to thee
among the strong o lord in which the initial letters in the hebrew
are m c b e i it is not known who is the author of these books but
as to their authority though they are not received by the jews saith
church who in settling her canon of the scriptures chose rather to be
directed by the tradition she had received from the apostles of christ
than by that of the scribes and pharisees and as the church has
declared these two books canonical even in two general councils viz
