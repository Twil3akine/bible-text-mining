and jerusalem was desolate that jeremias the prophet sat weeping and
mourned with this lamentation over jerusalem and with a sorrowful mind
sighing and moaning he said
but was added by the seventy interpreters to give the reader to
understand upon what occasion the lamentations were published
aleph how doth the city sit solitary that was full of people how
is the mistress of the gentiles become as a widow the princes of
provinces made tributary
beth weeping she hath wept in the night and her tears are on her
cheeks there is none to comfort her among all them that were dear to
her all her friends have despised her and are become her enemies
ghimel juda hath removed her dwelling place because of her
affliction and the greatness of her bondage she hath dwelt among the
nations and she hath found no rest all her persecutors have taken her
in the midst of straits
daleth the ways of sion mourn because there are none that come to
the solemn feast all her gates are broken down her priests sigh her
virgins are in affliction and she is oppressed with bitterness
he her adversaries are become her lords her enemies are enriched
because the lord hath spoken against her for the multitude of her
iniquities her children are led into captivity before the face of the
oppressor
vau and from the daughter of sion all her beauty is departed her
princes are become like rams that find no pastures and they are gone
away without strength before the face of the pursuer
zain jerusalem hath remembered the days of her affliction and
prevarication of all her desirable things which she had from the days of
old when her people fell in the enemys hand and there was no helper
the enemies have seen her and have mocked at her sabbaths
heth jerusalem hath grievously sinned therefore is she become
unstable all that honoured her have despised her because they have
seen her shame but she sighed and turned backward
teth her filthiness is on her feet and she hath not remembered
her end she is wonderfully cast down not having a comforter behold o
jod the enemy hath put out his hand to all her desirable things
for she hath seen the gentiles enter into her sanctuary of whom thou
gavest commandment that they should not enter into thy church
caph all her people sigh they seek bread they have given all
their precious things for food to relieve the soul see o lord and
consider for i am become vile
lamed o all ye that pass by the way attend and see if there
be any sorrow like to my sorrow for he hath made a vintage of me as
the lord spoke in the day of his fierce anger
mem from above he hath sent fire into my bones and hath
chastised me he hath spread a net for my feet he hath turned me back
he hath made me desolate wasted with sorrow all the day long
nun the yoke of my iniquities hath watched they are folded
together in his hand and put upon my neck my strength is weakened the
samech the lord hath taken away all my mighty men out of the
midst of me he hath called against me the time to destroy my chosen
men the lord hath trodden the winepress for the virgin daughter of
ain therefore do i weep and my eyes run down with water because
the comforter the relief of my soul is far from me my children are
desolate because the enemy hath prevailed
phe sion hath spread forth her hands there is none to comfort
her the lord hath commanded against jacob his enemies are round about
him jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them
sade the lord is just for i have provoked his mouth to wrath
hear i pray you all ye people and see my sorrow my virgins and my
young men are gone into captivity
coph i called for my friends but they deceived me my priests
and my ancients pined away in the city while they sought their food to
relieve their souls
res behold o lord for i am in distress my bowels are troubled
my heart is turned within me for i am full of bitterness abroad the
sword destroyeth and at home there is death alike
sin they have heard that i sigh and there is none to comfort me
all my enemies have heard of my evil they have rejoiced that thou hast
done it thou hast brought a day of consolation and they shall be like
unto me
thau let all their evil be present before thee and make vintage
of them as thou hast made vintage of me for all my iniquities for my
sighs are many and my heart is sorrowful
aleph how hath the lord covered with obscurity the daughter of
glorious one of israel and hath not remembered his footstool in the day
of his anger
beth the lord hath cast down headlong and hath not spared all
that was beautiful in jacob he hath destroyed in his wrath the strong
holds of the virgin of juda and brought them down to the ground he
hath made the kingdom unclean and the princes thereof
ghimel he hath broken in his fierce anger all the horn of israel
he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy and he hath
kindled in jacob as it were a flaming fire devouring round about
daleth he hath bent his bow as an enemy he hath fixed his right
hand as an adversary and he hath killed all that was fair to behold in
the tabernacle of the daughter of sion he hath poured out his
indignation like fire
he the lord is become as an enemy he hath cast down israel
headlong he hath overthrown all the walls thereof he hath destroyed
his strong holds and hath multiplied in the daughter of juda the
afflicted both men and women
vau and he hath destroyed his tent as a garden he hath thrown
down his tabernacle the lord hath caused feasts and sabbaths to be
forgotten in sion and hath delivered up king and priest to reproach
and to the indignation of his wrath
zain the lord hath cast off his altar he hath cursed his
sanctuary he hath delivered the walls of the towers thereof into the
hand of the enemy they have made a noise in the house of the lord as
in the day of a solemn feast
be destroyed as if it had not been consecrated but execrable
heth the lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
from destroying and the bulwark hath mourned and the wall hath been
destroyed together
teth her gates are sunk into the ground he hath destroyed and
broken her bars her king and her princes are among the gentiles the
law is no more and her prophets have found no vision from the lord
jod the ancients of the daughter of sion sit upon the ground
they have held their peace they have sprinkled their heads with dust
they are girded with haircloth the virgins of jerusalem hang down their
heads to the ground
caph my eyes have failed with weeping my bowels are troubled my
liver is poured out upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter
of my people when the children and the sucklings fainted away in the
streets of the city
lamed they said to their mothers where is corn and wine when
they fainted away as the wounded in the streets of the city when they
breathed out their souls in the bosoms of their mothers
mem to what shall i compare thee or to what shall i liken thee
thee o virgin daughter of sion for great as the sea is thy
destruction who shall heal thee
nun thy prophets have seen false and foolish things for thee and
they have not laid open thy iniquity to excite thee to penance but
they have seen for thee false revelations and banishments
samech all they that passed by the way have clapped their hands
at thee they have hissed and wagged their heads at the daughter of
the earth
phe all thy enemies have opened their month against thee they
have hissed and gnashed with the teeth and have said we will swallow
her up lo this is the day which we looked for we have found it we
have seen it
ain the lord hath done that which he purposed he hath fulfilled
his word which he commanded in the days of old he hath destroyed and
hath not spared and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee and
hath set up the horn of thy adversaries
sade their heart cried to the lord upon the walls of the daughter
of sion let tears run down like a torrent day and night give thyself
no rest and let not the apple of thy eye cease
coph arise give praise in the night in the beginning of the
watches pour out thy heart like water before the face of the lord
lift up thy hands to him for the life of thy little children that have
fainted for hunger at the top of all the streets
res behold o lord and consider whom thou hast thus dealt with
shall women then eat their own fruit their children of a span long
shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the lord
sin the child and the old man lie without on the ground my
virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword thou hast slain them
in the day of thy wrath thou hast killed and shewn them no pity
thau thou hast called as to a festival those that should terrify
me round about and there was none in the day of the wrath of the lord
that escaped and was left those that i brought up and nourished my
enemy hath consumed them
aleph i am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his
indignation
aleph he hath led me and brought me into darkness and not into
light
aleph only against me he hath turned and turned again his
hand all the day
beth my skin and my flesh he hath made old he hath broken my
bones
beth he hath built round about me and he hath compassed me with
gall and labour
beth he hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for
ever
ghimel he hath built against me round about that i may not get
out he hath made my fetters heavy
ghimel yea and when i cry and entreat he hath shut out my
prayer
ghimel he hath shut up my ways with square stones he hath turned
my paths upside down
daleth he is become to me as a bear lying in wait as a lion in
secret places
daleth he hath turned aside my paths and hath broken me in
pieces he hath made me desolate
daleth he hath bent his bow and set me as a mark for his arrows
he he hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver
he i am made a derision to all my people their song all the day
long
he he hath filled me with bitterness he hath inebriated me with
wormwood
vau and he hath broken my teeth one by one he hath fed me with
ashes
vau and my soul is removed far off from peace i have forgotten
good things
vau and i said my end and my hope is perished from the lord
zain remember my poverty and transgression the wormwood and the
gall
zain i will be mindful and remember and my soul shall languish
within me
zain these things i shall think over in my heart therefore will
heth the mercies of the lord that we are not consumed because
his commiserations have not failed
heth they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness
heth the lord is my portion said my soul therefore will i wait
for him
teth the lord is good to them that hope in him to the soul that
seeketh him
teth it is good to wait with silence for the salvation of god
teth it is good for a man when he hath borne the yoke from his
youth
jod he shall sit solitary and hold his peace because he hath
taken it up upon himself
jod he shall put his mouth in the dust if so be there may be
hope
jod he shall give his cheek to him that striketh him he shall be
filled with reproaches
caph for the lord will not cast off for ever
caph for if he hath cast off he will also have mercy according
to the multitude of his mercies
caph for he hath not willingly afflicted nor cast off the
children of men
lamed to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land
lamed to turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the
most high
lamed to destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment the lord hath
not approved
mem who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done when the
mem shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the
mem why hath a living man murmured man suffering for his sins
nun let us search our ways and seek and return to the lord
nun let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the lord in the
heavens
nun we have done wickedly and provoked thee to wrath therefore
thou art inexorable
samech thou hast covered in thy wrath and hast struck us thou
hast killed and hast not spared
samech thou hast set a cloud before thee that our prayer may not
pass through
samech thou hast made me as an outcast and refuse in the midst
of the people
phe all our enemies have opened their mouths against us
phe prophecy is become to us a fear and a snare and
destruction
phe my eye hath run down with streams of water for the
destruction of the daughter of my people
ain my eye is afflicted and hath not been quiet because there
was no rest
ain till the lord regarded and looked down from the heavens
ain my eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my
city
sade my enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird without
cause
sade my life is fallen into the pit and they have laid a stone
over me
sade waters have flowed over my head i said i am cut off
coph i have called upon thy name o lord from the lowest pit
coph thou hast heard my voice turn not away thy ear from my
sighs and cries
coph thou drewest near in the day when i called upon thee thou
saidst fear not
res thou hast judged o lord the cause of my soul thou the
res thou hast seen o lord their iniquity against me judge thou
my judgment
res thou hast seen all their fury and all their thoughts against
me

imaginations against me
sin the lips of them that rise up against me and their devices
against me all the day
sin behold their sitting down and their rising up i am their
song
thau thou shalt render them a recompense o lord according to
the works of their hands
thau thou shalt give them a buckler of heart thy labour
thau thou shalt persecute them in anger and shalt destroy them
from under the heavens o lord
aleph how is the gold become dim the finest colour is changed
the stones of the sanctuary are scattered in the top of every street
beth the noble sons of sion and they that were clothed with the
best gold how are they esteemed as earthen vessels the work of the
potters hands
ghimel even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast they have
given suck to their young the daughter of my people is cruel like the
ostrich in the desert
daleth the tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of
his mouth for thirst the little ones have asked for bread and there
was none to break it unto them
he they that were fed delicately have died in the streets they
that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dung
vau and the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater
than the sin of sodom which was overthrown in a moment and hands took
nothing in her
zain her nazarites were whiter than snow purer than milk more
ruddy than the old ivory fairer than the sapphire
heth their face is now made blacker than coals and they are not
known in the streets their skin hath stuck to their bones it is
withered and is become like wood
teth it was better with them that were slain by the sword than
with them that died with hunger for these pined away being consumed for
want of the fruits of the earth
jod the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own
children they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my
people
caph the lord hath accomplished his wrath he hath poured out his
fierce anger and he hath kindled a fire in sion and it hath devoured
the foundations thereof
lamed the kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the
world would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should
enter in by the gates of jerusalem
mem for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her
priests that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her
nun they have wandered as blind men in the streets they were
defiled with blood and when they could not help walking in it they
held up their skirts
samech depart you that are defiled they cried out to them
they said among the gentiles he will no more dwell among them
phe the face of the lord hath divided them he will no more
regard them they respected not the persons of the priests neither had
they pity on the ancient
ain while we were yet standing our eyes failed expecting help
for us in vain when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not
able to save
sade our steps have slipped in the way of our streets our end
draweth near our days are fulfilled for our end is come
coph our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the air
they pursued us upon the mountains they lay in wait for us in the
wilderness
res the breath of our mouth christ the lord is taken in our
sins to whom we said under thy shadow we shall live among the
who is called the christ that is the anointed of the lord but it also
relates in the spiritual sense to christ our lord suffering for our
sins
sin rejoice and be glad o daughter of edom that dwellest in
the land of hus to thee also shall the cup come thou shalt be made
drunk and naked
thau thy iniquity is accomplished o daughter of sion he will no
more carry thee away into captivity he hath visited thy iniquity o
daughter of edom he hath discovered thy sins
remember o lord what is come upon us consider and behold our
reproach
our inheritance is turned to aliens our houses to strangers
we are become orphans without a father our mothers are as widows
we have drunk our water for money we have bought our wood
we were dragged by the necks we were weary and no rest was given
us
we have given our hand to egypt and to the assyrians that we
might be satisfied with bread
our fathers have sinned and are not and we have borne their
iniquities
servants have ruled over us there was none to redeem us out of
their hand
we fetched our bread at the peril of our lives because of the
sword in the desert
our skin was burnt as an oven by reason of the violence of the
famine
they oppressed the women in sion and the virgins in the cities of
the princes were hanged up by their hand they did not respect the
persons of the ancients
they abused the young men indecently and the children fell under
the wood
the ancients have ceased from the gates the young men from the
choir of the singers
the joy of our heart is ceased our dancing is turned into
mourning
the crown is fallen from our head woe to us because we have
sinned
therefore is our heart sorrowful therefore are our eyes become
dim
for mount sion because it is destroyed foxes have walked upon
it
but thou o lord shalt remain for ever thy throne from
generation to generation
why wilt thou forget us for ever why wilt thou forsake us for a
long time
convert us o lord to thee and we shall be converted renew our
days as from the beginning
but thou hast utterly rejected us thou art exceedingly angry with
us
and disciple to the prophet jeremias and a sharer in his labours and
persecutions which is the reason why the ancient fathers have
considered this book as a part of the prophecy of jeremias and have
usually quoted it under his name
