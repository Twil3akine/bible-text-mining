but sellum the son of core the son of abiasaph the son of core
with his brethren and his fathers house the corites were over the

to these four levites were committed the whole number of the

and they abode in their watches round about the temple of the

and ahaz begot jara and jara begot alamath and azmoth and
and mosa begot banaa whose son raphaia begot elasa of whom was
born asel
and asel had six sons whose names are ezricam bochru ismahel
now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel
fled from before the philistines and fell down wounded in mount gelboe
and the philistines drew near pursuing after saul and his sons
and they killed jonathan and abinadab and melchisua the sons of saul
and the battle grew hard against saul and the archers reached him
and wounded him with arrows
and saul said to his armourbearer draw thy sword and kill me
lest these uncircumcised come and mock me but his armourbearer would
not for he was struck with fear so saul took his sword and fell upon
it
and when his armourbearer saw it to wit that saul was dead he
also fell upon his sword and died
so saul died and his three sons and all his house fell together
and when the men of israel that dwelt in the plains saw this
they fled and saul and his sons being dead they forsook their cities
and were scattered up and down and the philistines came and dwelt in
them
and the next day the philistines taking away the spoils of them
that were slain found saul and his sons lying on mount gelboe
and when they had stripped him and cut off his head and taken
away his armour they sent it into their land to be carried about and
shewn in the temples of the idols and to the people
and his armour they dedicated in the temple of their god and his
head they fastened up in the temple of dagon
and when the men of jabes galaad had heard this to wit all that
the philistines had done to saul
all the valiant men of them arose and took the bodies of saul
and of his sons and brought them to jabes and buried their bones under
the oak that was in jabes and they fasted seven days
so saul died for his iniquities because he transgressed the
commandment of the lord which he had commanded and kept it not and
moreover consulted also a witch
and trusted not in the lord therefore he slew him and
transferred his kingdom to david the son of isai
valiant men
then all israel gathered themselves to david in hebron saying we
are thy bone and thy flesh
yesterday also and the day before when saul was king thou wast
he that leddest out and broughtest in israel for the lord thy god said
to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be ruler over
them
so all the ancients of israel came to the king to hebron and
king over israel according to the word of the lord which he spoke in the
hand of samuel
and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus where
the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land
and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not come in
here but david took the castle of sion which is the city of david
and he said whosoever shall first strike the jebusites shall be
the head and chief captain and joab the son of sarvia went up first
and was made the general
and david dwelt in the castle and therefore it was called the
city of david
and he built the city round about from mello all round and joab
built the rest of the city
and david went on growing and increasing and the lord of hosts
was with him
these are the chief of the valiant man of david who helped him
to be made king over all israel according to the word of the lord
which he spoke to israel
and this is the number of the heroes of david jesbaam the son of
three hundred wounded by him at one time
and after him was eleazar his uncles son the ahohite who was
one of the three mighties
he was with david in phesdomim when the philistines were
gathered to that place to battle and the field of that country was full
of barley and the people fled from before the philistines
but these men stood in the midst of the field and defended it
and they slew the philistines and the lord gave a great deliverance to
his people
and three of the thirty captains went down to the rock wherein
valley of raphaim
and david was in a hold and the garrison of the philistines in
and david longed and said o that some man would give me water
of the cistern of bethlehem which is in the gate
and these three broke through the midst of the camp of the
in the gate and brought it to david to drink and he would not drink of
it but rather offered it to the lord
saying god forbid that i should do this in the sight of my god
and should drink the blood of these men for with the danger of their
lives they have brought me the water and therefore he would not drink
and abisai the brother of joab he was chief of three and he
lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew and he was
renowned among the three
and illustrious among the second three and their captain but
yet he attained not to the first three
banaias the son of joiada a most valiant man of cabseel who had
done many acts he slew the two ariels of moab and he went down and
killed a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow
signifies a lion
and he slew an egyptian whose stature was of five cubits and
who had a spear like a weavers beam and he went down to him with a
staff and plucked away the spear that he held in his hand and slew
him with his own spear
these things did banaias the son of joiada who was renowned
among the three valiant ones
and the first among the thirty but yet to the three he attained
not and david made him of his council
moreover the most valiant men of the army were asahel brother of
sammoth an arorite helles a phalonite
ira the son of acces a thecuite abiezer an anathothite
sobbochai a husathite ilai an ahohite
maharai a netophathite heled the son of baana a netophathite
ethai the son of ribai of gabaath of the sons of benjamin banai
a pharathonite
hurai of the torrent gaas abiel an arbathite azmoth a
the sons of assem a gezonite jonathan the son of sage an
ahiam the son of sachar an ararite
eliphal the son of ur
hepher a mecherathite ahia a phelonite
hesro a carmelite naarai the son of azbai
joel the brother of nathan mibahar the son of agarai
selec an ammonite naharai a berothite the armourbearer of joab
the son of sarvia
ira a jethrite gareb a jethrite
urias a hethite zabad the son of oholi
adina the son of siza a rubenite the prince of the rubenites and
thirty with him
hanan the son of maacha and josaphat a mathanite
ozia an astarothite samma and jehiel the sons of hotham an
jedihel the son of zamri and joha his brother a thosaite
eliel a mahumite and jeribai and josaia the sons of elnaim and
make him king
now these are they that came to david to siceleg while he yet
fled from saul the son of cis and they were most valiant and excellent
warriors
bending the bow and using either hand in hurling stones with
slings and shooting arrows of the brethren of saul of benjamin
the chief was ahiezer and joas the sons of samoa of gabaath and
and samaias of gabaon the stoutest amongst the thirty and over
the thirty jeremias and jeheziel and johanan and jozabad of gaderoth
and eluzai and jerimuth and baalia and samaria and saphatia
the haruphite
elcana and jesia and azareel and joezer and jesbaam of
and joela and zabadia the sons of jeroham of gedor
from gaddi also there went over to david when he lay hid in the
wilderness most valiant men and excellent warriors holding shield and
spear whose faces were like the faces of a lion and they were swift
like the roebucks on the mountains
ezer the chief obdias the second eliab the third
masmana the fourth jeremias the fifth
ethi the sixth eliel the seventh
johanan the eighth elzebad the ninth
jerenias the tenth machbani the eleventh
these were of the sons of gad captains of the army the least of
them was captain over a hundred soldiers and the greatest over a
thousand
these are they who passed over the jordan in the first month
when it is used to flow over its banks and they put to flight all that
dwelt in the valleys both toward the east and toward the west
and there came also of the men of benjamin and of juda to the
hold in which david abode
and david went out to meet them and said if you are come
peaceably to me to help me let my heart be joined to you but if you
plot against me for my enemies whereas i have no iniquity in my hands
let the god of our fathers see and judge
but the spirit came upon amasai the chief among thirty and he
said we are thine o david and for thee o son of isai peace peace
be to thee and peace to thy helpers for thy god helpeth thee so david
received them and made them captains of the band
and there were some of manasses that went over to david when he
came with the philistines against saul to fight but he did not fight
with them because the lords of the philistines taking counsel sent him
back saying with the danger of our heads he will return to his master
so when he went back to siceleg there fled to him of manasses
these helped david against the rovers for they were all most
valiant men and were made commanders in the army
moreover day by day there came some to david to help him till
they became a great number like the army of god
and this is the number of the chiefs of the army who came to
according to the word of the lord
the sons of juda bearing shield and spear six thousand eight
hundred well appointed to war
of the sons of simeon valiant men for war seven thousand one
hundred
of the sons of levi four thousand six hundred
and joiada prince of the race of aaron and with him three
thousand seven hundred
sadoc also a young man of excellent disposition and the house of
his father twentytwo principal men
and of the sons of benjamin the brethren of saul three thousand
for hitherto a great part of them followed the house of saul
and of the sons of ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred men of
great valour renowned in their kindreds
and of the half tribe of manasses eighteen thousand every one
by their names came to make david king
also of the sons of issachar men of understanding that knew all
times to order what israel should do two hundred principal men and all
the rest of the tribe followed their counsel
and of zabulon such as went forth to battle and stood in array
well appointed with armour for war there came fifty thousand to his
aid with no double heart
and of nephtali a thousand leaders and with them seven and
thirty thousand furnished with shield and spear
of dan also twentyeight thousand six hundred prepared for
battle
and of aser forty thousand going forth to fight and challenging
in battle
and on the other side of the jordan of the sons of ruben and of
thousand furnished with arms for war
all these men of war well appointed to fight came with a perfect
heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest
also of israel were of one heart to make david king
and they were there with david three days eating and drinking
for their brethren had prepared for them
moreover they that were near them even as far as issachar and
mules and on oxen to eat meal figs raisins wine oil and oxen
and sheep in abundance for there was joy in israel
dead
david consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds
and with all the commanders
and he said to all the assembly of israel if it please you and
if the words which i speak come from the lord our god let us send to
the rest of our brethren into all the countries of israel and to the
priests and the levites that dwell in the suburbs of the cities to
gather themselves to us
and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we sought it
not in the days of saul
and all the multitude answered that it should be so for the word
pleased all the people
so david assembled all israel from sihor of egypt even to the
entering into emath to bring the ark of god from cariathiarim
and david went up with all the men of israel to the hill of
sitting upon the cherubims where his name is called upon
and they carried the ark of god upon a new cart out of the house
of abinadab and oza and his brother drove the cart
and david and all israel played before god with all their might
with hymns and with harps and with psalteries and timbrels and
cymbals and trumpets
and when they came to the floor of chidon oza put forth his hand
to hold up the ark for the ox being wanton had made it lean a little on
one side
and the lord was angry with oza and struck him because he had
touched the ark and he died there before the lord
and david was troubled because the lord had divided oza and he
called that place the breach of oza to this day
and he feared god at that time saying how can i bring in the
ark of god to me
and therefore he brought it not home to himself that is into
the city of david but carried it aside into the house of obededom the
and the ark of god remained in the house of obededom three
months and the lord blessed his house and all that he had
and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees
and masons and carpenters to build him a house
and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king over
and david took other wives in jerusalem and he begot sons and
daughters
now these are the names of them that were born to him in
jebahar and elisua and eliphalet
and noga and napheg and japhia
elisama and baaliada and eliphalet
and the philistines hearing that david was anointed king over all
against them
and the philistines came and spread themselves in the vale of
and david consulted the lord saying shall i go up against the
to him go up and i will deliver them into thy hand
and when they were come to baalpharasim david defeated them
there and he said god hath divided my enemies by my hand as waters
are divided and therefore the name of that place was called
and they left there their gods and david commanded that they
should be burnt
another time also the philistines made an irruption and spread
themselves abroad in the valley
and david consulted god again and god said to him go not up
after them turn away from them and come upon them over against the
pear trees
and when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of
the pear trees then shalt thou go out to battle for god is gone out
before thee to strike the army of the philistines
and david did as god had commanded him and defeated the army of
the philistines slaying them from gabaon to gazera
and the name of david became famous in all countries and the
derideth davids devotion
he made also houses for himself in the city of david and built a
place for the ark of god and pitched a tabernacle for it
then david said no one ought to carry the ark of god but the
himself for ever
and he gathered all israel together into jerusalem that the ark
of god might be brought into its place which he had prepared for it
and the sons of aaron also and the levites
of the children of caath uriel was the chief and his brethren a
hundred and twenty
of the sons of merari asaia the chief and his brethren two
hundred and twenty
of the sons of gersom joel the chief and his brethren a hundred
and thirty
of the sons of elisaphan semeias the chief and his brethren two
hundred
of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren eighty
of the sons of oziel aminadab the chief and his brethren a
hundred and twelve
and david called sadoc and abiathar the priests and the
and he said to them you that are the heads of the levitical
families be sanctified with your brethren and bring the ark of the
lest as the lord at first struck us because you were not
present the same should now also come to pass by our doing some thing
against the law
so the priests and the levites were sanctified to carry the ark
of the lord the god of israel
and the sons of levi took the ark of god as moses had commanded
according to the word of the lord upon their shoulders with the
staves
and david spoke to the chiefs of the levites to appoint some of
their brethren to be singers with musical instruments to wit on
psalteries and harps and cymbals that the joyful noise might resound
on high
and they appointed levites hemam the son of joel and of his
brethren asaph the son of barachias and of the sons of merari their
brethren ethan the son of casaia
and with them their brethren in the second rank zacharias and
now the singers heman asaph and ethan sounded with cymbals of
brass
and zacharias and oziel and semiramoth and jehiel and ani
and eliab and maasias and banaias sung mysteries upon psalteries
and mathathias and eliphalu and macenias and obededom and
and chonenias chief of the levites presided over the prophecy
to give out the tunes for he was very skilful
called prophecy the more because these singers were often inspired
men
and barachias and elcana were doorkeepers of the ark
and sebenias and josaphat and nathanael and amasai and
before the ark of god and obededom and jehias were porters of the ark
so david and all the ancients of israel and the captains over
thousands went to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the
house of obededom with joy
and when god had helped the levites who carried the ark of the
covenant of the lord they offered in sacrifice seven oxen and seven
rams
and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the
ruler of the prophecy among the singers and david also had on him an
ephod of linen
and all israel brought the ark of the covenant of the lord with
joyful shouting and sounding with the sound of the cornet and with
trumpets and cymbals and psalteries and harps
and when the ark of the covenant of the lord was come to the city
of david michol the daughter of saul looking out at a window saw king
blesseth the people disposeth the offices of levites and maketh a
psalm of praise to god
so they brought the ark of god and set it in the midst of the
tent which david had pitched for it and they offered holocausts and
peace offerings before god
and when david had made an end of offering holocausts and peace
offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord
and he divided to all and every one both men and women a loaf of
bread and a piece of roasted beef and flour fried with oil
and he appointed levites to minister before the ark of the lord
and to remember his works and to glorify and praise the lord god of
asaph the chief and next after him zacharias moreover jahiel
and semiramoth and jehiel and mathathias and eliab and banaias and
but banaias and jaziel the priests to sound the trumpet
continually before the ark of the covenant of the lord
in that day david made asaph the chief to give praise to the lord
with his brethren
praise ye the lord and call upon his name make known his doings
among the nations
sing to him yea sing praises to him and relate all his wondrous
works
praise ye his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek
the lord
seek ye the lord and his power seek ye his face evermore
remember his wonderful works which he hath done his signs and
the judgments of his mouth
o ye seed of israel his servants ye children of jacob his
chosen
he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth
remember for ever his covenant the word which he commanded to a
thousand generations
the covenant which he made with abraham and his oath to isaac
and he appointed the same to jacob for a precept and to israel
for an everlasting covenant
saying to thee will i give the land of chanaan the lot of your
inheritance
when they were but a small number very few and sojourners in it
and they passed from nation to nation and from a kingdom to
another people
he suffered no man to do them wrong and reproved kings for their
sake
touch not my anointed and do no evil to my prophets
sing ye to the lord all the earth shew forth from day to day
his salvation
declare his glory among the gentiles his wonders among all
people
for the lord is great and exceedingly to be praised and he is to
be feared above all gods
for all the gods of the nations are idols but the lord made the
heavens
praise and magnificence are before him strength and joy in his
place
bring ye to the lord o ye families of the nations bring ye to
the lord glory and empire
give to the lord glory to his name bring up sacrifice and come
ye in his sight and adore the lord in holy becomingness
let all the earth be moved at his presence for he hath founded
the world immoveable
let the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad and let them say
among the nations the lord hath reigned
let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields
rejoice and all things that are in them
then shall the trees of the wood give praise before the lord
because he is come to judge the earth
give ye glory to the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth
for ever
and say ye save us o god our savior and gather us together
and deliver us from the nations that we may give glory to thy holy
name and may rejoice in singing thy praises
blessed be the lord the god of israel from eternity to eternity
and let all the people say amen and a hymn to god
so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord
continually day by day and in their courses
and obededom with his brethren sixtyeight and obededom the son
of idithun and hosa he appointed to be porters
and sadoc the priest and his brethren priests before the
tabernacle of the lord in the high place which was in gabaon
that they should offer holocausts to the lord upon the altar of
holocausts continually morning and evening according to all that is
written in the law of the lord which he commanded israel
and after him heman and idithun and the rest that were chosen
every one by his name to give praise to the lord because his mercy
endureth for ever
and heman and idithun sounded the trumpet and played on the
cymbals and all kinds of musical instruments to sing praises to god
and the sons of idithun he made porters
and all the people returned to their houses and david to bless
also his own house
now when david was dwelling in his house he said to nathan the
prophet behold i dwell in a house of cedar and the ark of the covenant
of the lord is under skins
and nathan said to david do all that is in thy heart for god is
with thee
now that night the word of god came to nathan saying
go and speak to david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt
not build me a house to dwell in
for i have not remained in a house from the time that i brought up
tabernacle and in a tent
abiding with all israel did i ever speak to any one of all the
judges of israel whom i charged to feed my people saying why have you
not built me a house of cedar
now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant david thus saith
the lord of hosts i took thee from the pastures from following the
flock that thou shouldst be ruler of my people israel
and i have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone and have
slain all thy enemies before thee and have made thee a name like that
of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth
and i have given a place my people israel they shall be planted
and shall dwell therein and shall be moved no more neither shall the
children of iniquity waste them as at the beginning
since the days that i gave judges to my people israel and have
humbled all thy enemies and i declare to thee that the lord will build
thee a house
and when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers i
will raise up thy seed after thee which shall be of thy sons and i
will establish his kingdom
he shall build me a house and i will establish his throne for
ever
i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and i
will not take my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was
before thee
but i will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever
and his throne shall be most firm for ever
according to all these words and according to all this vision
so did nathan speak to david
and king david came and sat before the lord and said who am i
me
but even this hath seemed little in thy sight and therefore thou
hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to
come and hast made me remarkable above all men o lord god
what can david add more seeing thou hast thus glorified thy
servant and known him
o lord for thy servants sake according to thy own heart thou
hast shewn all this magnificence and wouldst have all the great things
to be known
o lord there is none like thee and here is no other god beside
thee of all whom we have heard of with our ears
for what other nation is there upon earth like thy people israel
whom god went to deliver and make a people for himself and by his
greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had
delivered out of egypt
and thou hast made thy people israel to be thy own people for
ever and thou o lord art become their god
now therefore o lord let the word which thou hast spoken to thy
servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as
thou hast said
and let thy name remain and be magnified for ever and let it be
said the lord of hosts is god of israel and the house of david his
servant remaineth before him
for thou o lord my god hast revealed to the ear of thy servant
that thou wilt build him a house and therefore thy servant hath found
confidence to pray before thee
and now o lord thou art god and thou hast promised to thy
servant such great benefits
and thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant that it
may be always before thee for seeing thou blessest it o lord it shall
be blessed for ever
and it came to pass after this that david defeated the
of the hands of the philistines
and he defeated moab and the moabites were made davids servants
and brought him gifts
at that time david defeated also adarezer king of soba of the land
of hemath when he went to extend his dominions as far as the river
and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand
horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and he houghed all the chariot
horses only a hundred chariots which he reserved for himself
and the syrians of damascus came also to help adarezer king of
and he put a garrison in damascus that syria also should serve
him and bring gifts and the lord assisted him in all things to which
he went
and david took the golden quivers which the servants of adarezer
had and he brought them to jerusalem
likewise out of thebath and chun cities of adarezer he brought
very much brass of which solomon made the brazen sea and the pillars
and the vessels of brass
now when thou king of hemath heard that david had defeated all the
army of adarezer king of soba
he sent adoram his son to king david to desire peace of him and
to congratulate him that he had defeated and overthrown adarezer for
and all the vessels of gold and silver and brass king david
consecrated to the lord with the silver and gold which he had taken
from all the nations as well from edom and from moab and from the
sons of ammon as from the philistines and from amalec
and abisai the son of sarvia slew of the edomites in the vale of
the saltpits eighteen thousand
and he put a garrison in edom that edom should serve david and
the lord preserved david in all things to which he went
so david reigned over all israel and executed judgment and
justice among all his people
and joab the son of sarvia was over the army and josaphat the
son of ahilud recorder
and sadoc the son of achitob and achimelech the son of abiathar
were the priests and susa scribe
and banaias the son of joiada was over the bands of the cerethi
and the phelethi and the sons of david were chief about the king
confederates are overthrown
now it came to pass that naas the king of the children of ammon
died and his son reigned in his stead
and david said i will shew kindness to hanon the son of naas for
his father did a favour to me and david sent messengers to comfort him
upon the death of his father but when they were come into the land of
the children of ammon to comfort hanon
the princes of the children of ammon said to hanon thou thinkest
perhaps that david to do honour to thy father hath sent comforters to
thee and thou dost not take notice that his servants are come to thee
to consider and search and spy out thy land
wherefore hanon shaved the heads and beards of the servants of
sent them away
and when they were gone they sent word to david who sent to meet
them for they had suffered a great affront and ordered them to stay at
and when the children of ammon saw that they had done an injury to
silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia and out of
and they hired two and thirty thousand chariots and the king of
cities and came to battle
and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the army of
valiant men
and the children of ammon came out and put their army in array
before the gate of the city and the kings that were come to their aid
stood apart in the field
wherefore joab understanding that the battle was set against him
before and behind chose out the bravest men of all israel and marched
against the syrians
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abisai
his brother and they went against the children of ammon
and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt
help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee i will
help thee
be of good courage and let us behave ourselves manfully for our
people and for the cities of our god and the lord will do that which
is good in his sight
so joab and the people that were with him went against the
and the children of ammon seeing that the syrians were fled they
likewise fled from abisai his brother and went into the city and joab
also returned to jerusalem
but the syrians seeing that they had fallen before israel sent
messengers and brought to them the syrians that were beyond the river
and sophach general of the army of adarezer was their leader
and it was told david and he gathered together all israel and
passed the jordan and came upon them and put his army in array against
them and they fought with him
but the syrian fled before israel and david slew of the syrians
seven thousand chariots and forty thousand footmen and sophach the
general of the army
and when the servants of adarezer saw themselves overcome by
help the children of ammon any more
and it came to pass after the course of a year at the time that
kings go out to battle joab gathered together an army and the strength
of the troops and wasted the land of the children of ammon and went
and besieged rabba but david stayed at jerusalem when joab smote
and david took the crown of melchom from his head and found in it
a talent weight of gold and most precious stones and he made himself a
diadem of it he took also the spoils of the city which were very great
and the people that were therein he brought out and made harrows
and sleds and chariots of iron to go over them so that they were cut
and bruised to pieces in this manner david dealt with all the cities of
the children of ammon and he returned with all his people to jerusalem
after this there arose a war at gazer against the philistines in
which sabachai the husathite slew saphai of the race of raphaim and
humbled them
another battle also was fought against the philistines in which
the gethite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam
there was another battle also in geth in which there was a man of
great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each
hand and foot who also was born of the stock of rapha
he reviled israel but jonathan the son of samaa the brother of
hand of david and his servants
ceaseth upon his offering sacrifice in the thrashingfloor of ornan
and satan rose up against israel and moved david to number
and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people go and
number israel from bersabee even to dan and bring me the number of them
that i may know it
and joab answered the lord make his people a hundred times more
than they are but my lord the king are they not all thy servants why
doth my lord seek this thing which may be imputed as a sin to israel
but the kings word rather prevailed and joab departed and went
through all israel and returned to jerusalem
and he gave david the number of them whom he had surveyed and
all the number of israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men
that drew the sword and of juda four hundred and seventy thousand
fighting men
to be accounted for by supposing the greater number to be that which
was really found and the lesser to be that which joab gave in
but levi and benjamin he did not number for joab unwillingly
executed the kings orders
and god was displeased with this thing that was commanded and he
struck israel
and david said to god i have sinned exceedingly in doing this i
beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done
foolishly
and the lord spoke to gad the seer of david saying
go and speak to david and tell him thus saith the lord i give
thee the choice of three things choose one which thou wilt and i will
do it to thee
and when gad was come to david he said to him thus saith the
either three years famine or three months to flee from thy
enemies and not to be able to escape their sword or three days to have
the sword of the lord and pestilence in the land and the angel of the
shall answer him who sent me
famine mentioned kings and the seventh year of the lands
resting would make up the seven years proposed by the prophet kings

and david said to gad i am on every side in a great strait but
it is better for me to fall into the hands of the lord for his mercies
are many than into the hands of men
so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel and there fell of
and he sent an angel to jerusalem to strike it and as he was
striking it the lord beheld and took pity for the greatness of the
evil and said to the angel that destroyed it is enough now stop thy
hand and the angel of the lord stood by the thrashingfloor of ornan the
and david lifting up his eyes saw the angel of the lord standing
between heaven and earth with a drawn sword in his hand turned against
flat on the ground
and david said to god am not i he that commanded the people to
be numbered it is i that have sinned it is i that have done the evil
but as for this flock what hath it deserved o lord my god let thy
hand be turned i beseech thee upon me and upon my fathers house and
let not thy people be destroyed
and the angel of the lord commanded gad to tell david to go up
and build an altar to the lord god in the thrashingfloor of ornan the
and david went up according to the word of gad which he spoke
to him in the name of the lord
now when ornan looked up and saw the angel he and his four sons
hid themselves for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor
and as david was coming to ornan ornan saw him and went out of
the thrashingfloor to meet him and bowed down to him with his face to
the ground
and david said to him give me this place of thy thrashingfloor
that i may build therein an altar to the lord but thou shalt take of me
as much money as it is worth that the plague may cease from the people
and ornan said to david take it and let my lord the king do all
that pleaseth him and moreover the oxen also i give for a holocaust
and the drays for wood and the wheat for the sacrifice i will give it
all willingly
and king david said to him it shall not be so but i will give
thee money as much as it is worth for i must not take it from thee and
so offer to the lord holocausts free cost
so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred sicles of gold
of just weight
which the temple was afterwards built but the price of the oxen was
fifty sicles of silver kings
and he built there an altar to the lord and he offered
holocausts and peace offerings and he called upon the lord and he
heard him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust
and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again
into the sheath
and david seeing that the lord had heard him in the
thrashingfloor of ornan the jebusite forthwith offered victims there
but the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the desert
and the altar of holocausts was at that time in the high place of
and david could not go to the altar there to pray to god for he
was seized with an exceeding great fear seeing the sword of the angel
of the lord
temple and the princes to assist him
then david said this is the house of god and this is the altar
for the holocaust of israel
and he commanded to gather together all the proselytes of the land
of israel and out of them he appointed stonecutters to hew stones and
polish them to build the house of god
and david prepared in abundance iron for the nails of the gates
and for the closures and joinings and of brass an immense weight
and the cedar trees were without number which the sidonians and
and david said solomon my son is very young and tender and the
house which i would have to be built to the lord must be such as to be
renowned in all countries therefore i will prepare him necessaries and
therefore before his death he prepared all the charges
and he called for solomon his son and commanded him to build a
house to the lord the god of israel
and david said to solomon my son it was my desire to have built
a house to the name of the lord my god
but the word of the lord came to me saying thou hast shed much
blood and fought many battles so thou canst not build house to my
name after shedding so much blood before me
the son that shall be born to thee shall be a most quiet man
for i will make him rest from all his enemies round about and therefore
he shall be called peaceable and i will give peace and quietness to
he shall build a house to my name and he shall be a son to me
and i will be a father to him and i will establish the throne of his
kingdom over israel for ever
now then my son the lord be with thee and do thou prosper and
build the house to the lord thy god as he hath spoken of thee
the lord also give thee wisdom and understanding that thou
mayest be able to rule israel and to keep the law of the lord thy god
for then thou shalt be able to prosper if thou keep the
commandments and judgments which the lord commanded moses to teach
behold i in my poverty have prepared the charges of the house of
the lord of gold a hundred thousand talents and of silver a million of
talents but of brass and of iron there is no weight for the abundance
surpasseth all account timber also and stones i have prepared for all
the charges
thou hast also workmen in abundance hewers of stones and
masons and carpenters and of all trades the most skilful in their
work
in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron whereof there
is no number arise then and be doing and the lord will be with thee
david also charged all the princes of israel to help solomon his
son
saying you see that the lord your god is with you and hath
given you rest round about and hath delivered all your enemies into
your hands and the land is subdued before the lord and before his
people
give therefore your hearts and your souls to seek the lord your
the covenant of the lord and the vessels consecrated to the lord may
be brought into the house which is built to the name of the lord
offices
david being old and full of days made solomon his son king over
and he gathered together all the princes of israel and the
priests and levites
and the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
upwards and there were found of them thirtyeight thousand men
of these twentyfour thousand were chosen and distributed unto
the ministry of the house of the lord and six thousand were the
overseers and judges
moreover four thousand were porters and as many singers singing
to the lord with the instruments which he had made to sing with
and david distributed them into courses by the families of the
sons of levi to wit of gerson and of caath and of merari

minister in the holy of holies he and his sons for ever and to burn

these are the sons of levi in their kindreds and families
princes by their courses and the number of every head that did the
works of the ministry of the house of the lord from twenty years old and
upward
for david said the lord the god of israel hath given rest to his
people and a habitation in jerusalem for ever
and it shall not be the office of the levites to carry any more
the tabernacle and all the vessels for the service thereof
so according to the last precepts of david the sons of levi are
to be numbered from twenty years old and upward
and they are to be under the hand of the sons of aaron for the
service of the house of the lord in the porches and in the chambers
and in the place of purification and in the sanctuary and in all the

so eleazar and ithamar did the office of the priesthood
and david distributed them that is sadoc of the sons of eleazar
and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar according to their courses and
ministry
and there were found many more of the sons of eleazar among the
principal men than of the sons of ithamar and he divided them so that
there were of the sons of eleazar sixteen chief men by their families

over juda eliu the brother of david over issachar amri the son
of michael
over the zabulonites jesmaias the son of adias over the
over the sons of ephraim osee the son of ozaziu over the half
tribe of manasses joel the son of phadaia
and over the half tribe of manasses in galaad jaddo the son of
and over dan ezrihel the son of jeroham these were the princes
of the children of israel
but david would not number them from twenty years old and under
because the lord had said that he would multiply israel like the stars
of heaven
joab the son of sarvia began to number but he finished not
because upon this there fell wrath upon israel and therefore the number
of them that were numbered was not registered in the chronicles of king
and over the kings treasures was azmoth the son of adiel and
over those stores which were in the cities and in the villages and in
the castles was jonathan the son of ozias
and over the tillage and the husbandmen who tilled the ground
was ezri the son of chelub
and over the dressers of the vine yards was semeias a romathite
and over the wine cellars zabdias an aphonite
and over the oliveyards and the fig groves which were in the
plains was balanam a gederite and over the oil cellars joas
and over the herds that fed in saron was setrai a saronite and
over the oxen in the valleys saphat the son of adli
and over the camels ubil an ishmahelite and over the asses
and over the sheep jaziz an agarene all these were the rulers of
the substance of king david
and jonathan davids uncle a counsellor a wise and learned man
he and jahiel the son of hachamoni were with the kings sons
and achitophel was the kings counsellor and chusai the
and after achitophel was joiada the son of banaias and abiathar
giveth him a pattern of the temple
and david assembled all the chief men of israel the princes of
the tribes and the captains of the companies who waited on the king
and the captains over thousands and over hundreds and them who had the
charge over the substance and possessions of the king and his sons with
the officers of the court and the men of power and all the bravest of
the army at jerusalem
and the king rising up and standing said hear me my brethren
and my people i had a thought to have built a house in which the ark
of the lord and the footstool of our god might rest and prepared all
things for the building
and god said to me thou shalt not build a house to my name
because thou art a man of war and hast shed blood
but the lord god of israel chose me of all the house of my father
to be king over israel for ever for of juda he chose the princes and
of the house of juda my fathers house and among the sons of my
father it pleased him to choose me king over all israel
and among my sons for the lord hath given me many sons he hath
chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the lord
over israel
and he said to me solomon thy son shall build my house and my
courts for i have chosen him to be my son and i will be a father to
him
and i will establish his kingdom for ever if he continue to keep
my commandments and my judgments as at this day
now then before all the assembly of israel in the hearing of our
you may possess the good land and may leave it to your children after
you for ever
and thou my son solomon know the god of thy father and serve him
with a perfect heart and a willing mind for the lord searcheth all
hearts and understandeth all the thoughts of minds if thou seek him
thou shalt find him but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off for
ever
now therefore seeing the lord hath chosen thee to build the house
of the sanctuary take courage and do it
and david gave to solomon his son a description of the porch and
of the temple and of the treasures and of the upper floor and of the
inner chambers and of the house for the mercy seat
as also of all the courts which he had in his thought and of
the chambers round about for the treasures of the house of the lord
and for the treasures of the consecrated things
and of the divisions of the priests and of the levites for all
the works of the house of the lord and for all the vessels of the
service of the temple of the lord
gold by weight for every vessel for the ministry and silver by
weight according to the diversity of the vessels and uses
he gave also gold for the golden candlesticks and their lamps
according to the dimensions of every candlestick and the lamps thereof
candlesticks and for their lamps according to the diversity of the
dimensions of them
he gave also gold for the tables of proposition according to the
diversity of the tables in like manner also silver for other tables of
silver
for fleshhooks also and bowls and censors of fine gold and for
little lions of gold according to the measure he gave by weight for
every lion in like manner also for lions of silver he set aside a
different weight of silver
and for the altar of incense he gave the purest gold and to
make the likeness of the chariot of the cherubims spreading their wings
and covering the ark of the covenant of the lord
all these things said he came to me written by the hand of the
and david said to solomon his son act like a man and take
courage and do fear not and be not dismayed for the lord my god will
be with thee and will not leave thee nor forsake thee till thou hast
finished all the work for the service of the house of the lord
behold the courses of the priests and the levites for every
ministry of the house of the lord stand by thee and are ready and
both the princes and the people know how to execute all thy
commandments
liberally to the building of the temple his thanksgiving prayer and
sacrifices his death
and king david said to all the assembly solomon my son whom
alone god hath chosen is as yet young and tender and the work is
great for a house is prepared not for man but for god
and i with all my ability have prepared the expenses for the house
of my god gold for vessels of gold and silver for vessels of silver
brass for things of brass iron for things of iron wood for things of
wood and onyx stones and stones like alabaster and of divers colours
and all manner of precious stones and marble of paros in great
abundance
now over and above the things which i have offered into the house
of my god i give of my own proper goods gold and silver for the temple
of my god beside what things i have prepared for the holy house
three thousand talents of gold of the gold of ophir and seven
thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the temple
and gold for wheresoever there is need of gold and silver for
wheresoever there is need of silver for the works to be made by the
hands of the artificers now if any man is willing to offer let him
fill his hand to day and offer what he pleaseth to the lord
then the heads of the families and the princes of the tribes of
of the kings possessions promised
and they gave for the works of the house of the lord of gold
five thousand talents and ten thousand solids of silver ten thousand
talents and of brass eighteen thousand talents and of iron a hundred
thousand talents
and all they that had stones gave them to the treasures of the
house of the lord by the hand of jahiel the gersonite
and the people rejoiced when they promised their offerings
willingly because they offered them to the lord with all their heart
and david the king rejoiced also with a great joy
and he blessed the lord before all the multitude and he said
eternity
thine o lord is magnificence and power and glory and
victory and to thee is praise for all that is in heaven and in earth
is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art above all princes
thine are riches and thine is glory thou hast dominion over
all in thy hand is power and might in thy hand greatness and the
empire of all things
now therefore our god we give thanks to thee and we praise thy
glorious name
who am i and what is my people that we should be able to
promise thee all these things all things are thine and we have given
thee what we received of thy hand
for we are sojourners before thee and strangers as were all our
fathers our days upon earth are as a shadow and there is no stay
o lord our god all this store that we have prepared to build
thee a house for thy holy name is from thy hand and all things are
thine
i know my god that thou provest hearts and lovest simplicity
wherefore i also in the simplicity of my heart have joyfully offered
all these things and i have seen with great joy thy people which are
here present offer thee their offerings
o lord god of abraham and of isaac and of israel our fathers
keep for ever this will of their heart and let this mind remain always
for the worship of thee
and give to solomon my son a perfect heart that he may keep thy
commandments thy testimonies and thy ceremonies and do all things
and build the house for which i have provided the charges
and david commanded all the assembly bless ye the lord our god
bowed themselves and worshipped god and then the king
and they sacrificed victims to the lord and they offered
holocausts the next day a thousand bullocks a thousand rams a
thousand lambs with their libations and with every thing prescribed
most abundantly for all israel
and they ate and drank before the lord that day with great joy
anointed him to the lord to be prince and sadoc to be high priest
and solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of
and all the princes and men of power and all the sons of king
and the lord magnified solomon over all israel and gave him the
glory of a reign such as no king of israel had before him
so david the son of isai reigned over all israel
and the days that he reigned over israel were forty years in
and he died in a good age full of days and riches and glory
now the acts of king david first and last are written in the book
of samuel the seer and in the book of nathan the prophet and in the
book of gad the seer
and of all his reign and his valour and of the times that
passed under him either in israel or in all the kingdoms of the
countries
giveth him
and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and
the lord his god was with him and magnified him to a high degree
and solomon gave orders to all israel to the captains of
thousands and of hundreds and to the rulers and to the judges of all
and he went with all the multitude to the high place of gabaon
where was the tabernacle of the covenant of the lord which moses the
servant of god made in the wilderness
for david had brought the ark of god from cariathiarim to the
place which he had prepared for it and where he had pitched a
tabernacle for it that is in jerusalem
and the altar of brass which beseleel the son of uri the son of
and all the assembly sought it
and solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the
tabernacle of the covenant of the lord and offered up on it a thousand
victims
and behold that night god appeared to him saying ask what thou
wilt that i should give thee
and solomon said to god thou hast shewn great kindness to my
father david and hast made me king in his stead
now therefore o lord god let thy word be fulfilled which thou
hast promised to david my father for thou hast made me king over thy
great people which is as innumerable as the dust of the earth
give me wisdom and knowledge that i may come in and go out before
thy people for who can worthily judge this thy people which is so
great
and god said to solomon because this choice hath pleased thy
heart and thou hast not asked riches and wealth and glory nor the
lives of them that hate thee nor many days of life but hast asked
wisdom and knowledge to be able to judge my people over which i have
made thee king
wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee and i will give thee
riches and wealth and glory so that none of the kings before thee
nor after thee shall be like thee
then solomon came from the high place of gabaon to jerusalem
before the tabernacle of the covenant and reigned over israel
and he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen and he had a
thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen and he
placed them in the cities of the chariots and with the king in
and the king made silver and gold to be in jerusalem as stones
and cedar trees as sycamores which grow in the plains in great
multitude
and there were horses brought him from egypt and from coa by the
kings merchants who went and bought at a price
a chariot of four horses for six hundred pieces of silver and a
horse for a hundred and fifty in like manner market was made in all the
kingdoms of the hethites and of the kings of syria
and solomon determined to build a house to the name of the lord
and a palace for himself
and he numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens and
eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains and three thousand six
hundred to oversee them
he sent also to hiram king of tyre saying as thou didst with
which he dwelt
so do with me that i may build a house to the name of the lord my
aromatical spices and for the continual setting forth of bread and for
the holocausts morning and evening and on the sabbaths and on the new
moons and the solemnities of the lord our god for ever which are
commanded for israel
for the house which i desire to build is great for our god is
great above all gods
who then can be able to build him a worthy house if heaven and
the heavens of heavens cannot contain him who am i that i should be
able to build him a house but to this end only that incense may be
burnt before him
send me therefore a skilful man that knoweth how to work in gold
and in silver in brass and in iron in purple in scarlet and in blue
and that hath skill in engraving with the artificers which i have with
me in judea and jerusalem whom david my father provided
send me also cedars and fir trees and pine trees from libanus
for i know that thy servants are skilful in cutting timber in libanus
and my servants shall be with thy servants
to provide me timber in abundance for the house which i desire to
build is to be exceeding great and glorious
and i will give thy servants the workmen that are to cut down the
trees for their food twenty thousand cores of wheat and as many cores
of barley and twenty thousand measures of wine and twenty thousand
measures of oil
and hiram king of tyre sent a letter to solomon saying because
the lord hath loved his people therefore he hath made thee king over
them
and he added saying blessed be the lord the god of israel who
made heaven and earth who hath given to king david a wise and knowing
son endued with understanding and prudence to build a house to the
i therefore have sent thee my father hiram a wise and most
skilful man
the son of a woman of the daughters of dan whose father was a
iron and in marble and in timber in purple also and violet and silk
and scarlet and who knoweth to grave all sort of graving and to devise
ingeniously all that there may be need of in the work with thy
artificers and with the artificers of my lord david thy father
the wheat therefore and the barley and the oil and the wine
which thou my lord hast promised send to thy servants
and we will cut down as many trees out of libanus as thou shalt
want and will convey them in floats by sea to joppe and it will be thy
part to bring them thence to jerusalem
and solomon numbered all the proselytes in the land of israel
after the numbering which david his father had made and they were found
a hundred and fiftythree thousand and six hundred
and he set seventy thousand of them to carry burdens on their
shoulders and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains and three
thousand and six hundred to be overseers of the work of the people
pillars
and solomon began to build the house of the lord in jerusalem in
mount moria which had been shewn to david his father in the place
which david had prepared in the thrashingfloor of ornan the jebusite
and he began to build in the second month in the fourth year of
his reign
now these are the foundations which solomon laid to build the
house of god the length by the first measure sixty cubits the breadth
twenty cubits
and the porch in the front which was extended in length according
to the measure of the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the
height was a hundred and twenty cubits and he overlaid it within with
pure gold
and the greater house he ceiled with deal boards and overlaid them
with plates of fine gold throughout and he graved in them palm trees
and like little chains interlaced with one another
he paved also the floor of the temple with most precious marble of
great beauty
and the gold of the plates with which he overlaid the house and
the beams thereof and the posts and the walls and the doors was of
the finest and he graved cherubims on the walls
he made also the house of the holy of holies the length of it
according to the breadth of the temple twenty cubits and the breadth
of it in like manner twenty cubits and he overlaid it with plates of
gold amounting to about six hundred talents
he made also nails of gold and the weight of every nail was fifty
sicles the upper chambers also he overlaid with gold
he made also in the house of the holy of holies two cherubims of
image work and he overlaid them with gold
the wings of the cherubims were extended twenty cubits so that
one wing was five cubits long and reached to the wall of the house and
the other was also five cubits long and reached to the wing of the
other cherub
in like manner the wing of the other cherub was five cubits long
and reached to the wall and his other wing was five cubits long and
touched the wing of the other cherub
so the wings of the two cherubims were spread forth and were
extended twenty cubits and they stood upright on their feet and their
faces were turned toward the house without
he made also a veil of violet purple scarlet and silk and
wrought in it cherubims
he made also before the doors of the temple two pillars which
were five and thirty cubits high and their chapiters were five cubits
he made also as it were little chains in the oracle and he put
them on the heads of the pillars and a hundred pomegranates which he
put between the little chains
these pillars he put at the entrance of the temple one on the
right hand and the other on the left that which was on the right hand
he called jachin and that on the left hand booz
candlesticks and other vessels and ornaments of the temple
he made also an altar of brass twenty cubits long and twenty
cubits broad and ten cubits high
also a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in
compass it was five cubits high and a line of thirty cubits compassed
it round about
and under it there was the likeness of oxen and certain engravings
on the outside of ten cubits compassed the belly of the sea as it were
with two rows
and the oxen were cast and the sea itself was set upon the twelve
oxen three of which looked toward the north and other three toward the
west and other three toward the south and the other three that
remained toward the east and the sea stood upon them and the hinder
parts of the oxen were inward under the sea
now the thickness of it was a handbreadth and the brim of it was
like the brim of a cup or of a crisped lily and it held three thousand
measures
he made also ten lavers and he set five on the right hand and
five on the left to wash in them all such things as they were to offer
for holocausts but the sea was for the priests to wash in
and he made ten golden candlesticks according to the form which
they were commanded to be made by and he set them in the temple five
on the right hand and five on the left
moreover also ten tables and he set them in the temple five on
the right side and five on the left also a hundred bowls of gold
he made also the court of the priests and a great hall and doors
in the hall which he covered with brass
and he set the sea on the right side over against the east toward
the south
and hiram made caldrons and fleshhooks and bowls and finished
all the kings work the house of god
that is to say the two pillars and the pommels and the
chapiters and the network to cover the chapiters over the pommels
and four hundred pomegranates and two wreaths of network so that
two rows of pomegranates were joined to each wreath to cover the
pommels and the chapiters of the pillars
he made also bases and lavers which he set upon the bases
one sea and twelve oxen under the sea
and the caldrons and fleshhooks and bowls all the vessels did
brass
in the country near the jordan did the king cast them in a clay
ground between sochot and saredatha
and the multitude of vessels was innumerable so that the weight
of the brass was not known
and solomon made all the vessels for the house of god and the
golden altar and the tables upon which were the loaves of proposition
the candlesticks also of most pure gold with their lamps to give
light before the oracle according to the manner
and certain flowers and lamps and golden tongs all were made of
the finest gold
the vessels also for the perfumes and the censers and the bowls
and the mortars of pure gold and he graved the doors of the inner
temple that is for the holy of holies and the doors of the temple
without were of gold and thus all the work was finished which solomon
made in the house of the lord
filled with the glory of god
then solomon brought in all those things that david his father had
vowed the silver and the gold and all the vessels he put among the
treasures of the house of god
and after this he gathered together the ancients of israel and all
the princes of the tribes and the heads of the families of the
children of israel to jerusalem to bring the ark of the covenant of the
and all the men of israel came to the king in the solemn day of the
seventh month
and when all the ancients of israel were come the levites took up
the ark
and brought it in together with all the furniture of the
tabernacle and the priests with the levites carried the vessels of the
sanctuary which were in the tabernacle
and king solomon and all the assembly of israel and all that were
gathered together before the ark sacrificed rams and oxen without
number so great was the multitude of the victims
and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord into
its place that is to the oracle of the temple into the holy of holies
under the wings of the cherubims
so that the cherubims spread their wings over the place in which
the ark was set and covered the ark itself and its staves
now the ends of the staves wherewith the ark was carried because
they were some thing longer were seen before the oracle but if a man
were a little outward he could not see them so the ark has been there
unto this day
and there was nothing else in the ark but the two tables which
now when the priests were come out of the sanctuary for all the
priests that could be found there were sanctified and as yet at that
time the courses and orders of the ministries were not divided among
them
both the levites and the singing men that is both they that were
under asaph and they that were under heman and they that were under
sounded with cymbals and psalteries and harps standing on the east
side of the altar and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding
with trumpets
so when they all sounded together both with trumpets and voice
and cymbals and organs and with divers kind of musical instruments
and lifted up their voice on high the sound was heard afar off so that
when they began to praise the lord and to say give glory to the lord
for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever the house of god was
filled with a cloud
nor could the priests stand and minister by reason of the cloud
then solomon said the lord promised that he would dwell in a
cloud
but i have built a house to his name that he might dwell there for
ever
and the king turned his face and blessed all the multitude of
blessed be the lord the god of israel who hath accomplished in
deed that which he spoke to david my father saying
from the day that i brought my people out of the land of egypt i
chose no city among all the tribes of israel for a house to be built in
it to my name neither chose i any other man to be the ruler of my
people israel
but i chose jerusalem that my name might be there and i chose
and whereas david my father had a mind to build a house to the name
of the lord the god of israel
the lord said to him forasmuch as it was thy will to build a house
to my name thou hast done well indeed in having such a will
but thou shalt not build the house but thy son who shall come out
of thy loins he shall build a house to my name
the lord therefore hath accomplished his word which he spoke and
of israel as the lord promised and have built a house to the name of
the lord god of israel
and i have put in it the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord
which he made with the children of israel
and he stood before the altar of the lord in presence of all the
multitude of israel and stretched forth his hands
for solomon had made a brazen scaffold and had set it in the
midst of the temple which was five cubits long and five cubits broad
and three cubits high and he stood upon it then kneeling down in the
presence of all the multitude of israel and lifting up his hands
towards heaven
he said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven
nor in earth who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that
walk before thee with all their hearts
who hast performed to thy servant david my father all that thou
hast promised him and hast accomplished in fact what thou hast spoken
with thy mouth as also the present time proveth
now then o lord god of israel fulfil to thy servant david my
father whatsoever thou hast promised him saying there shall not fail
thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel yet so that
thy children take heed to their ways and walk in my law as thou hast
walked before me
and now lord god of israel let thy word be established which
thou hast spoken to thy servant david
is it credible then that god should dwell with men on the earth
this house which i have built
but to this end only it is made that thou mayest regard the
prayer of thy servant and his supplication o lord my god and mayest
hear the prayers which thy servant poureth out before thee
that thou mayest open thy eyes upon this house day and night upon
the place wherein thou hast promised that thy name should be called
upon
and that thou wouldst hear the prayer which thy servant prayeth in
it hearken then to the prayers of thy servant and of thy people
place that is from heaven and shew mercy
if any man sin against his neighbour and come to swear against
him and bind himself with a curse before the altar in this house
then hear thou from heaven and do justice to thy servants so to
requite the wicked by making his wickedness fall upon his own head and
to revenge the just rewarding him according to his justice
if thy people israel be overcome by their enemies for they will
sin against thee and being converted shall do penance and call upon
thy name and pray to thee in this place
then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy people
their fathers
if the heavens be shut up and there fall no rain by reason of the
sin of the people and they shall pray to thee in this place and
confess to thy name and be converted from their sins where thou dost
afflict them
then hear thou from heaven o lord and forgive the sins of thy
servants and of thy people israel and teach them the good way in which
they may walk and give rain to thy land which thou hast given to thy
people to possess
if a famine arise in the land or a pestilence or blasting or
mildew or locusts or caterpillars or if their enemies waste the
country and besiege the cities whatsoever scourge or infirmity shall
be upon them
then if any of thy people israel knowing his own scourge and
infirmity shall pray and shall spread forth his hands in this house
hear thou from heaven from thy high dwelling place and forgive
and render to every one according to his ways which thou knowest him to
have in his heart for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of
men
that they may fear thee and walk in thy ways all the days that
they live upon the face of the land which thou hast given to our
fathers
if the stranger also who is not of thy people israel come from a
far country for the sake of thy great name and thy strong hand and
thy stretched out arm and adore in this place
hear thou from heaven thy firm dwelling place and do all that
which that stranger shall call upon thee for that all the people of the
earth may know thy name and may fear thee as thy people israel and
may know that thy name is invoked upon this house which i have built
if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that
thou shalt send them and adore thee towards the way of this city which
thou hast chosen and the house which i have built to thy name
then hear thou from heaven their prayers and their supplications
and revenge them
and if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth
not and thou be angry with them and deliver them up to their enemies
and they lead them away captive to a land either afar off or near at
hand
and if they be converted in their heart in the land to which they
were led captive and do penance and pray to thee in the land of their
captivity saying we have sinned we have done wickedly we have dealt
unjustly
and return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul
in the land of their captivity to which they were led away and adore
thee towards the way of their own land which thou gavest their fathers
and of the city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have
built to thy name
then hear thou from heaven that is from thy firm dwelling place
their prayers and do judgment and forgive thy people although they
have sinned
for thou art my god let thy eyes i beseech thee be open and
let thy ears be attentive to the prayer that is made in this place
now therefore arise o lord god into thy resting place thou and
the ark of thy strength let thy priests o lord god put on salvation
and thy saints rejoice in good things
o lord god turn not away the face of thy anointed remember the
mercies of david thy servant
dedication of the temple god signifieth his having heard solomons
prayer yet so if he continue to serve him
and when solomon had made an end of his prayer fire came down from
heaven and consumed the holocausts and the victims and the majesty of
the lord filled the house
neither could the priests enter into the temple of the lord
because the majesty of the lord had filled the temple of the lord
moreover all the children of israel saw the fire coming down and
the glory of the lord upon the house and falling down with their faces
to the ground upon the stone pavement they adored and praised the
and the king and all the people sacrificed victims before the lord
and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twentytwo thousand oxen
and one hundred and twenty thousand rams and the king and all the
people dedicated the house of god
and the priests stood in their offices and the levites with the
instruments of music of the lord which king david made to praise the
their ministry and the priests sounded with trumpets before them and
all israel stood
solomon also sanctified the middle of the court before the temple
of the lord for he offered there the holocausts and the fat of the
peace offerings because the brazen altar which he had made could not
hold the holocausts and the sacrifices and the fat
and solomon kept the solemnity at that time seven days and all
to the torrent of egypt
and he made on the eighth day a solemn assembly because he had
kept the dedication of the altar seven days and had celebrated the
solemnity seven days
so on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
away the people to their dwellings joyful and glad for the good that
the lord had done to david and to solomon and to all israel his
people
and solomon finished the house of the lord and the kings house
and all that he had designed in his heart to do in the house of the
and the lord appeared to him by night and said i have heard thy
prayer and i have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice
if i shut up heaven and there fall no rain or if i give orders
and command the locust to devour the land or if i send pestilence among
my people
and my people upon whom my name is called being converted shall
make supplication to me and seek out my face and do penance for their
most wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their
sins and will heal their land
my eyes also shall be open and my ears attentive to the prayer of
him that shall pray in this place
for i have chosen and have sanctified this place that my name
may be there for ever and my eyes and my heart may remain there
perpetually
and as for thee if thou walk before me as david thy father
walked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and keep my
justices and my judgments
i will raise up the throne of thy kingdom as i promised to david
thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man of thy stock to be
ruler in israel
but if you turn away and forsake my justices and my commandments
which i have set before you and shall go and serve strange gods and
adore them
i will pluck you up by the root out of my land which i have given
you and this house which i have sanctified to my name i will cast away
from before my face and will make it a byword and an example among all
nations
and this house shall be for a proverb to all that pass by and
they shall be astonished and say why hath the lord done thus to this
land and to this house
and they shall answer because they forsook the lord the god of
their fathers who brought them out of the land of egypt and laid hold
on strange gods and adored them and worshipped them therefore all
these evils are come upon them
and at the end of twenty years after solomon had built the house of
the lord and his own house
he built the cities which hiram had given to solomon and caused
the children of israel to dwell there
he went also into emath suba and possessed it
and he built palmira in the desert and he built other strong
cities in emath
and he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the nether
walled cities with gates and bars and locks
balaath also and all the strong cities that were solomons and all
the cities of the chariots and the cities of the horsemen all that
and in all the land of his dominion
all the people that were left of the hethites and the amorrhites
and the pherezites and the hevites and the jebusites that were not of
the stock of israel
of their children and of the posterity whom the children of
but of the children of israel he set none to serve in the kings
works for they were men of war and chief captains and rulers of his
chariots and horsemen
and all the chief captains of king solomons army were two hundred
and fifty who taught the people
and he removed the daughter of pharao from the city of david to
the house which he had built for her for the king said my wife shall
not dwell in the house of david king of israel for it is sanctified
because the ark of the lord came into it
then solomon offered holocausts to the lord upon the altar of the
that every day an offering might be made on it according to the
ordinance of moses in the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the
festival days three times a year that is to say in the feast of
unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of
tabernacles
and he appointed according to the order of david his father the
offices of the priests in their ministries and the levites in their
order to give praise and minister before the priests according to the
duty of every day and the porters in their divisions by gate and gate
for so david the man of god had commanded
and the priests and levites departed not from the kings
commandments as to any thing that he had commanded and as to the
keeping of the treasures
solomon had all charges prepared from the day that he founded the
house of the lord until the day wherein he finished it
then solomon went to asiongaber and to ailath on the coast of
the red sea which is in the land of edom
and hiram sent him ships by the hands of his servants and skilful
mariners and they went with solomons servants to ophir and they took
thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought it to king
and when the queen of saba heard of the fame of solomon she came
to try him with hard questions at jerusalem with great riches and
camels which carried spices and abundance of gold and precious
stones and when she was come to solomon she proposed to him all that
was in her heart
and solomon explained to her all that she proposed and there was
not any thing that he did not make clear unto her
and when she had seen these things to wit the wisdom of solomon
and the house which he had built
and the meats of his table and the dwelling places of his
servants and the attendance of his officers and their apparel his
cupbearers also and their garments and the victims which he offered in
the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her she was so
astonished
and she said to the king the word is true which i heard in my
country of thy virtues and wisdom
i did not believe them that told it until i came and my eyes had
seen and i had proved that scarce one half of thy wisdom had been told
me thou hast exceeded the same with thy virtues
happy are thy men and happy are thy servants who stand always
before thee and hear thy wisdom
blessed be the lord thy god who hath been pleased to set thee on
his throne king of the lord thy god because god loveth israel and
will preserve them forever therefore hath he made thee king over them
to do judgment and justice
and she gave to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and
spices in great abundance and most precious stones there were no such
spices as these which the queen of saba gave to king solomon
and the servants also of hiram with the servants of solomon
brought gold from ophir and thyine trees and most precious stones
and the king made of the thyine trees stairs in the house of the
men never were there seen such trees in the land of juda
and king solomon gave to the queen of saba all that she desired
and that she asked and many more things than she brought to him so she
returned and went to her own country with her servants
and the weight of the gold that was brought to solomon every
year was six hundred and sixtysix talents of gold
beside the sum which the deputies of divers nations and the
merchants were accustomed to bring and all the kings of arabia and the
lords of the lands who brought gold and silver to solomon
and king solomon made two hundred golden spears of the sum of six
hundred pieces of gold which went to every spear
and three hundred golden shields of three hundred pieces of gold
which went to the covering of every shield and the king put them in the
armoury which was compassed with a wood
the king also made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with
pure gold
and six steps to go up to the throne and a footstool of gold and
two arms one on either side and two lions standing by the arms
moreover twelve other little lions standing upon the steps on both
sides there was not such a throne in any kingdom
and all the vessels of the kings table were of gold and the
vessels of the house of the forest of libanus were of the purest gold
for the kings ships went to tharsis with the servants of hiram
once in three years and they brought thence gold and silver and ivory
and apes and peacocks
and solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth for
riches and glory
and all the kings of the earth desired to see the face of solomon
that they might hear the wisdom which god had given in his heart
and every year they brought him presents vessels of silver and of
gold and garments and armour and spices and horses and mules
and solomon had forty thousand horses in the stables and twelve
thousand chariots and horsemen and he placed them in the cities of the
chariots and where the king was in jerusalem
and he exercised authority over all the kings from the river
and he made silver as plentiful in jerusalem as stones and cedars
as common as the sycamores which grow in the plains
and horses were brought to him out of egypt and out of all
countries
now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are written in
the words of nathan the prophet and in the books of ahias the silonite
and in the vision of addo the seer against jeroboam the son of nabat
and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years
and he slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of
and roboam went to sichem for thither all israel were assembled
to make him king
and when jeroboam the son of nabat who was in egypt for he was
fled thither from solomon heard it forthwith he returned
and they sent for him and he came with all israel and they spoke
to roboam saying
thy father oppressed with a most grievous yoke do thou govern us
with a lighter hand than thy father who laid upon us a heavy servitude
and ease some thing of the burden that we may serve thee
and he said to them come to me again after three days and when
the people were gone
he took counsel with the ancients who had stood before his father
may answer the people
and they said to him if thou please this people and soothe them
with kind words they will be thy servants for ever
but he forsook the counsel of the ancients and began to treat
with the young men that had been brought up with him and were in his
train
and he said to them what seemeth good to you or what shall i
answer this people who have said to me ease the yoke which thy father
laid upon us
but they answered as young men and brought up with him in
pleasures and said thus shalt thou speak to the people that said to
thee thy father made our yoke heavy do thou ease it thus shalt thou
answer them my little finger is thicker than the loins of my father
my father laid upon you a heavy yoke and i will add more weight
to it my father beat you with scourges but i will beat you with
scorpions
so jeroboam and all the people came to roboam the third day as
he commanded them
and the king answered roughly leaving the counsel of the
ancients
and he spoke according to the advice of the young men my father
laid upon you a heavy yoke which i will make heavier my father beat
you with scourges but i will beat you with scorpions
and he condescended not to the peoples requests for it was the
will of god that his word might be fulfilled which he had spoken by the
hand of ahias the silonite to jeroboam the son of nabat
and all the people upon the kings speaking roughly said thus
unto him we have no part in david nor inheritance in the son of isai
house and israel went away to their dwellings
but roboam reigned over the children of israel that dwelt in the
cities of juda
and king roboam sent aduram who was over the tributes and the
children of israel stoned him and he died and king roboam made haste
to get up into his chariot and fled into jerusalem
and israel revolted from the house of david unto this day
and roboam came to jerusalem and called together all the house of
warriors to fight against israel and to bring back his kingdom to him
and the word of the lord came to semeias the man of god saying
speak to roboam the son of solomon the king of juda and to all
thus saith the lord you shall not go up nor fight against your
brethren let every man return to his own house for by my will this
thing has been done and when they heard the word of the lord they
returned and did not go against jeroboam
and roboam dwelt in jerusalem and built walled cities in juda
and he built bethlehem and etam and thecue
and bethsur and socho and odollam
and geth and maresa and ziph
and aduram and lachis and azecha
saraa also and aialon and hebron which are in juda and
and when he had enclosed them with walls he put in them
governors and storehouses of provisions that is of oil and of wine
moreover in every city he made an armoury of shields and spears
and he fortified them with great diligence and he reigned over juda
and benjamin
and the priests and levites that were in all israel came to him
out of all their seats
leaving their suburbs and their possessions and passing over to
from executing the priestly office to the lord
and he made to himself priests for the high places and for the
devils and for the calves which he had made
moreover out of all the tribes of israel whosoever gave their
heart to seek the lord the god of israel came into jerusalem to
sacrifice their victims before the lord the god of their fathers
and they strengthened the kingdom of juda and established roboam
the son of solomon for three years for they walked in the ways of david
and of solomon only three years
and roboam took to wife mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the
son of david and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of isai
and they bore him sons jehus and somorias and zoom
and after her he married maacha the daughter of absalom who bore
him abia and ethai and ziza and salomith
and roboam loved maacha the daughter of absalom above all his
wives and concubines for he had married eighteen wives and threescore
concubines and he begot eight and twenty sons and threescore
daughters
but he put at the head of them abia the son of maacha to be the
chief ruler over all his brethren for he meant to make him king
because he was wiser and mightier than all his sons and in all
the countries of juda and of benjamin and in all the walled cities
and he gave them provisions in abundance and he sought many wives
who carrieth away all the treasures of the temple
and when the kingdom of roboam was strengthened and fortified he
forsook the law of the lord and all israel with him
and in the fifth year of the reign of roboam sesac king of egypt
came up against jerusalem because they had sinned against the lord
with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen and
the people were without number that came with him out of egypt to wit
and he took the strongest cities in juda and came to jerusalem
and semeias the prophet came to roboam and to the princes of
he said to them thus saith the lord you have left me and i have left
you in the hand of sesac
and the princes of israel and the king being in a consternation
said the lord is just
and when the lord saw that they were humbled the word of the lord
came to semeias saying because they are humbled i will not destroy
them and i will give them a little help and my wrath shall not fall
upon jerusalem by the hand of sesac
but yet they shall serve him that they may know the difference
between my service and the service of a kingdom of the earth
so sesac king of egypt departed from jerusalem taking away the
treasures of the kings house and he took all with him and the golden
shields that solomon had made
instead of which the king made brazen ones and delivered them to
the captains of the shieldbearers who guarded the entrance of the
palace
and when the king entered into the house of the lord the
shieldbearers came and took them and brought them back again to their
armoury
but yet because they were humbled the wrath of the lord turned
away from them and they were not utterly destroyed for even in juda
there were found good works
king roboam therefore was strengthened in jerusalem and reigned
he was one and forty years old when he began to reign and he reigned
seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord chose out of all
the tribes of israel to establish his name there and the name of his
mother was naama an ammonitess
but he did evil and did not prepare his heart to seek the lord
now the acts of roboam first and last are written in the books of
there was war between roboam and jeroboam all their days
and roboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of
in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam abia reigned over juda
three years he reigned in jerusalem and his mothers name was
and jeroboam
or abessalom and uriel
and when abia had begun battle and had with him four hundred
thousand most valiant and chosen men jeroboam put his army in array
against him eight hundred thousand men who were also chosen and most
valiant for war
and abia stood upon mount semeron which was in ephraim and said
do you not know that the lord god of israel gave to david the
kingdom over israel for ever to him and to his sons by a covenant of
salt

and jeroboam the son of nabat the servant of solomon the son of
and there were gathered to him vain men and children of belial
and they prevailed against roboam the son of solomon for roboam was
unexperienced and of a fearful heart and could not resist them
and now you say that you are able to withstand the kingdom of the
multitude of people and golden calves which jeroboam hath made you for
gods
and you have cast out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron
and the levites and you have made you priests like all the nations of
the earth whosoever cometh and consecrateth his hand with a bullock of
the herd and with seven rams is made a priest of those who are no
gods
but the lord is our god whom we forsake not and the priests who
minister to the lord are the sons of aaron and the levites are in their
order
and they offer holocausts to the lord every day morning and
evening and incense made according to the ordinance of the law and the
loaves are set forth on a most clean table and there is with us the
golden candlestick and the lamps thereof to be lighted always in the
evening for we keep the precepts of the lord our god whom you have
forsaken
therefore god is the leader in our army and his priests who
sound with trumpets and resound against you o children of israel
fight not against the lord the god of your fathers for it is not good
for you
while he spoke these things jeroboam caused an ambushment to
come about behind him and while he stood facing the enemies he
encompassed juda who perceived it not with his army
and when juda looked back they saw the battle coming upon them
both before and behind and they cried to the lord and the priests
began to sound with the trumpets
and all the men of juda shouted and behold when they shouted
and the children of israel fled before juda and the lord
delivered them into their hand
and abia and his people slew them with a great slaughter and
there fell wounded of israel five hundred thousand valiant men
and the children of israel were brought down at that time and
the children of juda were exceedingly strengthened because they had
trusted in the lord the god of their fathers
and abia pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him bethel
and her daughters and jesana with her daughters ephron also and her
daughters
and jeroboam was not able to resist any more in the days of
but abia being strengthened in his kingdom took fourteen wives
and begot two and twenty sons and sixteen daughters
and the rest of the acts of abia and of his ways and works are
written diligently in the book of addo the prophet
and abia slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city
of david and asa his son reigned in his stead in his days the land was
quiet ten years
and asa did that which was good and pleasing in the sight of his
places
and broke the statues and cut down the groves
and he commanded juda to seek the lord the god of their fathers
and to do the law and all the commandments
and he took away out of all the cities of juda the altars and
temples and reigned in peace
he built also strong cities in juda for he was quiet and there
had no wars risen in his time the lord giving peace
and he said to juda let us build these cities and compass them
with walls and fortify them with towers and gates and bars while all
is quiet from wars because we have sought the lord the god of our
fathers and he hath given us peace round about so they built and
there was no hinderance in building
and asa had in his army of men that bore shields and spears of
bows two hundred and eighty thousand all these were most valiant men
and zara the ethiopian came out against them with his army of ten
hundred thousand men and with three hundred chariots and he came as
far as maresa
and asa went out to meet him and set his army in array for
battle in the vale of sephata which is near maresa
and he called upon the lord god and said lord there is no
difference with thee whether thou help with few or with many help us
against this multitude o lord thou art our god let not man prevail
against thee
and the lord terrified the ethiopians before asa and juda and
the ethiopians fled
and asa and the people that were with him pursued them to gerara
and the ethiopians fell even to utter destruction for the lord slew
them and his army fought against them and they were destroyed and
they took abundance of spoils
and they took all the cities round about gerara for a great fear
was come upon all men and they pillaged the cities and carried off
much booty
and they destroyed the sheepcotes and took an infinite number of
cattle and of camels and returned to jerusalem
mother
and the spirit of god came upon azarias the son of oded
and he went out to meet asa and said to him hear ye me asa and
all juda and benjamin the lord is with you because you have been with
him if you seek him you shall find but if you forsake him he will
forsake you
and many days shall pass in israel without the true god and
without a priest a teacher and without the law
and when in their distress they shall return to the lord the god
of israel and shall seek him they shall find him
at that time there shall be no peace to him that goeth out and
cometh in but terrors on every side among all the inhabitants of the
earth
for nation shall fight against nation and city against city for
the lord will trouble them with all distress
do you therefore take courage and let not your hands be weakened
for there shall be a reward for your work
and when asa had heard the words and the prophecy of azarias the
son of oded the prophet he took courage and took away the idols out of
all the land of juda and out of benjamin and out of the cities of
mount ephraim which he had taken and he dedicated the altar of the
and he gathered together all juda and benjamin and the strangers
with them of ephraim and manasses and simeon for many were come over
to him out of israel seeing that the lord his god was with him
and when they were come to jerusalem in the third month in the
fifteenth year of the reign of asa
they sacrificed to the lord in that day of the spoils and of the
prey that they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
rams
and he went in to confirm as usual the covenant that they should
seek the lord the god of their fathers with all their heart and with
all their soul
and if any one said he seek not the lord the god of israel let
him die whether little or great man or woman
and they swore to the lord with a loud voice with joyful
shouting and with sound of trumpet and sound of cornets
all that were in juda with a curse for with all their heart they
swore and with all their will they sought him and they found him and
the lord gave them rest round about
moreover maacha the mother of king asa he deposed from the royal
authority because she had made in a grove an idol of priapus and he
entirely destroyed it and breaking it into pieces burnt it at the
torrent cedron
but high places were left in israel nevertheless the heart of
and the things which his father had vowed and he himself had
vowed he brought into the house of the lord gold and silver and
vessels of divers uses
and there was no war unto the five and thirtieth year of the
kingdom of asa
death
and in the six and thirtieth year of his kingdom baasa the king
of israel came up against juda and built a wall about rama that no one
might safely go out or come in of the kingdom of asa
then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
house of the lord and of the kings treasures and sent to benadad king
of syria who dwelt in damascus saying
there is a league between me and thee as there was between my
father and thy father wherefore i have sent thee silver and gold that
thou mayst break thy league with baasa king of israel and make him
depart from me
and when benadad heard this he sent the captains of his armies
against the cities of israel and they took ahion and dan and
and when baasa heard of it he left off the building of rama and
interrupted his work
then king asa took all juda and they carried away from rama the
stones and the timber that baasa had prepared for the building and he
built with them gabaa and maspha
at that time hanani the prophet came to asa king of juda and said
to him because thou hast had confidence in the king of syria and not
in the lord thy god therefore hath the army of the king of syria
escaped out of thy hand
were not the ethiopians and the libyans much more numerous in
chariots and horsemen and an exceeding great multitude yet because
thou trustedst in the lord he delivered them into thy hand
for the eyes of the lord behold all the earth and give strength
to those who with a perfect heart trust in him wherefore thou hast
done foolishly and for this cause from this time wars shall arise
against thee
and asa was angry with the seer and commanded him to be put in
prison for he was greatly enraged because of this thing and he put to
death many of the people at that time
but the works of asa the first and last are written in the book
of the kings of juda and israel
and asa fell sick in the nine and thirtieth year of his reign of
a most violent pain in his feet and yet in his illness he did not seek
the lord but rather trusted in the skill of physicians
and he slept with his fathers and he died in the one and
fortieth year of his reign
and they buried him in his own sepulchre which he had made for
himself in the city of david and they laid him on his bed full of
spices and odoriferous ointments which were made by the art of the
perfumers and they burnt them over him with very great pomp
numerous forces
and josaphat his son reigned in his stead and grew strong against
and he placed numbers of soldiers in all the fortified cities of
and the lord was with josaphat because he walked in the first
ways of david his father and trusted not in baalim
but in the god of his father and walked in his commandments and
not according to the sins of israel
and the lord established the kingdom in his hand and all juda
brought presents to josaphat and he acquired immense riches and much
glory
and when his heart had taken courage for the ways of the lord he
took away also the high places and the groves out of juda
and in the third year of his reign he sent of his princes
in the cites of juda
and with them the levites semeias and nathanias and zabadias
and asael and semiramoth and jonathan and adonias and tobias and
and they taught the people in juda having with them the book of
the law of the lord and they went about all the cities of juda and
instructed the people
and the fear of the lord came upon all the kingdoms of the lands
that were round about juda and they durst not make war against
the philistines also brought presents to josaphat and tribute in
silver and the arabians brought him cattle seven thousand seven
hundred rams and as many hegoats
and josaphat grew and became exceeding great and he built in
and he prepared many works in the cities of juda and he had
warriors and valiant men in jerusalem
of whom this is the number of the houses and families of every
one in juda captains of the army ednas the chief and with him three
hundred thousand most valiant men
after him johanan the captain and with him two hundred and
eighty thousand
and after him was amasias the son of zechri consecrated to the
after him was eliada valiant in battle and with him two hundred
thousand armed with bow and shield
after him also was jozabad and with him a hundred and eighty
thousand ready for war
all these were at the hand of the king beside others whom he
had put in the walled cities in all juda
is slain as micheas had foretold
now josaphat was rich and very glorious and was joined by
affinity to achab
and he went down to him after some years to samaria and achab at
his coming killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people
that came with him and he persuaded him to go up to ramoth galaad
and achab king of israel said to josaphat king of juda come with
me to ramoth galaad and he answered him thou art as i am and my
people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war
and josaphat said to the king of israel inquire i beseech thee
at present the word of the lord
so the king of israel gathered together of the prophets four
hundred men and he said to them shall we go to ramoth galaad to fight
or shall we forbear but they said go up and god will deliver into the
kings hand
and josaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that
we may inquire also of him
and the king of israel said to josaphat there is one man of whom
we may ask the will of the lord but i hate him for he never
prophesieth good to me but always evil and it is micheas the son of
and the king of israel called one of the eunuchs and said to him
now the king of israel and josaphat king of juda both sat on
their thrones clothed in royal robes and they sat in the open court by
the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them
and sedecias the son of chanaana made him horns of iron and
said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push syria till thou
destroy it
and all the prophets prophesied in like manner and said go up
to ramoth galaad and thou shalt prosper and the lord will deliver them
into the kings hand
and the messenger that went to call micheas said to him behold
the words of all the prophets with one mouth declare good to the king i
beseech thee therefore let not thy word disagree with them and speak
thou also good success
and micheas answered him as the lord liveth whatsoever my god
shall say to me that will i speak
so he came to the king and the king said to him micheas shall
we go to ramoth galaad to fight or forbear and he answered him go up
for all shall succeed prosperously and the enemies shall be delivered
into your hands
and the king said i adjure thee again and again to say nothing
but the truth to me in the name of the lord
then he said i saw all israel scattered in the mountains like
sheep without a shepherd and the lord said these have no masters let
every man return to his own house in peace
and the king of israel said to josaphat did i not tell thee that
this man would not prophesy me any good but evil
then he said hear ye therefore the word of the lord i saw the
on the right hand and on the left
and the lord said who shall deceive achab king of israel that
he may go up and fall in ramoth galaad and when one spoke in this
manner and another otherwise
there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i
will deceive him and the lord said to him by what means wilt thou
deceive him
and he answered i will go out and be a lying spirit in the
mouth of all his prophets and the lord said thou shalt deceive and
shalt prevail go out and do so
now therefore behold the lord hath put a spirit of lying in the
mouth of all thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil against thee
and sedecias the son of chanaana came and struck micheas on the
cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak
to thee
and micheas said thou thyself shalt see in that day when thou
shalt go in from chamber to chamber to hide thyself
and the king of israel commanded saying take micheas and carry
him to amon the governor of the city and to joas the son of amelech
and say thus saith the king put this fellow in prison and give
him bread and water in a small quantity till i return in peace
and micheas said if thou return in peace the lord hath not
spoken by me and he said hear all ye people
so the king of israel and josaphat king of juda went up to ramoth
and the king of israel said to josaphat i will change my dress
and so i will go to the battle but put thou on thy own garments and
the king of israel having changed his dress went to the battle
now the king of syria had commanded the captains of his cavalry
saying fight ye not with small or great but with the king of israel
only
so when the captains of the cavalry saw josaphat they said this
is the king of israel and they surrounded him to attack him but he
cried to the lord and he helped him and turned them away from him
for when the captains of the cavalry saw that he was not the
king of israel they left him
and it happened that one of the people shot an arrow at a
venture and struck the king of israel between the neck and the
shoulders and he said to his chariot man turn thy hand and carry me
out of the battle for i am wounded
and the fight was ended that day but the king of israel stood in
his chariot against the syrians until the evening and died at the
sunset
and josaphat king of juda returned to his house in peace to
and jehu the son of hanani the seer met him and said to him thou
helpest the ungodly and thou art joined in friendship with them that
hate the lord and therefore thou didst deserve indeed the wrath of the
but good works are found in thee because thou hast taken away the
groves out of the land of juda and hast prepared thy heart to seek the
and josaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again to the
people from bersabee to mount ephraim and brought them back to the lord
the god of their fathers
and he set judges of the land in all the fenced cities of juda in
every place
and charging the judges he said take heed what you do for you
exercise not the judgment of man but of the lord and whatsoever you
judge it shall redound to you
let the fear of the lord be with you and do all things with
diligence for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect
of persons nor desire of gifts
in jerusalem also josaphat appointed levites and priests and
chiefs of the families of israel to judge the judgment and the cause of
the lord for the inhabitants thereof
and he charged them saying thus shall you do in the fear of the
every cause that shall come to you of your brethren that dwell
in their cities between kindred and kindred wheresoever there is
question concerning the law the commandment the ceremonies the
justifications shew it them that they may not sin against the lord
and that wrath may not come upon you and your brethren and so doing you
shall not sin
and amarias the priest your high priest shall be chief in the
things which regard god and zabadias the son of ismahel who is ruler
in the house of juda shall be over those matters which belong to the
kings office and you have before you the levites for masters take
courage and do diligently and the lord will be with you in good things
seeketh gods help by public prayer and fasting a prophet foretelleth
that god will fight for his people the enemies destroy one another
his navy perisheth for his society with wicked ochozias
after this the children of moab and the children of ammon and
with them of the ammonites were gathered together to fight against
and there came messengers and told josaphat saying there cometh
a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea and out of syria
and behold they are in asasonthamar which is engaddi
and josaphat being seized with fear betook himself wholly to pray
to the lord and he proclaimed a fast for all juda
and juda gathered themselves together to pray to the lord and all
came out of their cities to make supplication to him
and josaphat stood in the midst of the assembly of juda and
and said o lord god of our fathers thou art god in heaven and
rulest over all the kingdoms and nations in thy hand is strength and
power and no one can resist thee
didst not thou our god kill all the inhabitants of this land
before thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy
friend for ever
and they dwelt in it and built in it a sanctuary to thy name
saying
if evils fall upon us the sword of judgment or pestilence or
famine we will stand in thy presence before this house in which thy
name is called upon and we will cry to thee in our afflictions and
thou wilt hear and save us
now therefore behold the children of ammon and of moab and
mount seir through whose lands thou didst not allow israel to pass
when they came out of egypt but they turned aside from them and slew
them not
do the contrary and endeavour to cast us out of the possession
which thou hast delivered to us
o our god wilt thou not then judge them as for us we have not
strength enough to be able to resist this multitude which cometh
violently upon us but as we know not what to do we can only turn our
eyes to thee
and all juda stood before the lord with their little ones and
their wives and their children
and jahaziel the son of zacharias the son of banaias the son of
upon whom the spirit of the lord came in the midst of the multitude
and he said attend ye all juda and you that dwell in
not and be not dismayed at this multitude for the battle is not yours
but gods
to morrow you shall go down against them for they will come up
by the ascent named sis and you shall find them at the head of the
torrent which is over against the wilderness of jeruel
it shall not be you that shall fight but only stand with
confidence and you shall see the help of the lord over you o juda and
against them and the lord will be with you
then josaphat and juda and all the inhabitants of jerusalem
fell flat on the ground before the lord and adored him
and the levites of the sons of caath and of the sons of core
praised the lord the god of israel with a loud voice on high
and they rose early in the morning and went out through the
desert of thecua and as they were marching josaphat standing in the
midst of them said hear me ye men of juda and all the inhabitants of
believe his prophets and all things shall succeed well
and he gave counsel to the people and appointed the singing men
of the lord to praise him by their companies and to go before the
army and with one voice to say give glory to the lord for his mercy
endureth for ever
and when they began to sing praises the lord turned their
ambushments upon themselves that is to say of the children of ammon
and of moab and of mount seir who were come out to fight against juda
and they were slain
for the children of ammon and of moab rose up against the
inhabitants of mount seir to kill and destroy them and when they had
made an end of them they turned also against one another and destroyed
one another
and when juda came to the watch tower that looketh toward the
desert they saw afar off all the country for a great space full of
dead bodies and that no one was left that could escape death
then josaphat came and all the people with him to take away the
spoils of the dead and they found among the dead bodies stuff of
various kinds and garments and most precious vessels and they took
them for themselves insomuch that they could not carry all nor in
three days take away the spoils the booty was so great
and on the fourth day they were assembled in the valley of
that place the valley of blessing until this day
and every man of juda and the inhabitants of jerusalem returned
and josaphat at their head into jerusalem with great joy because the
and they came into jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
trumpets into the house of the lord
and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
when they heard that the lord had fought against the enemies of israel
and the kingdom of josaphat was quiet and god gave him peace
round about
and josaphat reigned over juda and he was five and thirty years
old when he began to reign and he reigned five and twenty years in
and he walked in the way of his father asa and departed not from
it doing the things that were pleasing before the lord
but yet he took not away the high places and the people had not
yet turned their heart to the lord the god of their fathers
but the rest of the acts of josaphat first and last are written
in the words of jehu the son of hanani which he digested into the books
of the kings of israel
after these things josaphat king of juda made friendship with
and he was partner with him in making ships to go to tharsis
and they made the ships in asiongaber
and eliezer the son of dodau of maresa prophesied to josaphat
saying because thou hast made a league with ochozias the lord hath
destroyed thy works and the ships are broken and they could not go to
and josaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with them in
the city of david and joram his son reigned in his stead
and he had brethren the sons of josaphat azarias and jahiel and
sons of josaphat king of juda
and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and
pensions with strong cities in juda but the kingdom he gave to joram
because he was the eldest
so joram rose up over the kingdom of his father and when he had
established himself he slew all his brethren with the sword and some
of the princes of israel
joram was two and thirty years old when he began to reign and he
reigned eight years in jerusalem
and he walked in the ways of the kings of israel as the house of
the sight of the lord
but the lord would not destroy the house of david because of the
covenant which he had made with him and because he had promised to give
a lamp to him and to his sons for ever
in those days edom revolted from being subject to juda and made
themselves a king
and joram went over with his princes and all his cavalry with
him and rose in the night and defeated the edomites who had surrounded
him and all the captains of his cavalry
however edom revolted from being under the dominion of juda unto
this day at that time lobna also revolted from being under his hand
moreover he built also high places in the cities of juda and he
made the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication and juda to
transgress
and there was a letter brought him from eliseus the prophet in
which it was written thus saith the lord the god of david thy father
the ways of asa king of juda
but hast walked in the ways of the kings of israel and hast made
the fornication of the house of achab moreover also thou hast killed
thy brethren the house of thy father better men than thyself
behold the lord will strike thee with a great plague with all
thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy substance
and thou shalt be sick of a very grievous disease of thy bowels
till thy vital parts come out by little and little every day
and the lord stirred up against joram the spirit of the
and they came up into the land of juda and wasted it and they
carried away all the substance that was found in the kings house his
sons also and his wives so that there was no son left him but joachaz
who was the youngest
and besides all this the lord struck him with an incurable
disease in his bowels
and as day came after day and time rolled on two whole years
passed then after being wasted with a long consumption so as to void
his very bowels his disease ended with his life and he died of a most
wretched illness and the people did not make a funeral for him
according to the manner of burning as they had done for his ancestors
he was two and thirty years old when he began his reign and he
reigned eight years in jerusalem and he walked not rightly and they
buried him in the city of david but not in the sepulchres of the kings
and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ochozias his youngest son
king in his place for the rovers of the arabians who had broke in upon
the camp had killed all that were his elder brothers so ochozias the
son of joram king of juda reigned
ochozias was fortytwo years old when he began to reign and he
reigned one year in jerusalem and the name of his mother was athalia
the daughter of amri
he also walked in the ways of the house of achab for his mother
pushed him on to do wickedly
so he did evil in the sight of the lord as the house of achab
did for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his
destruction
and he walked after their counsels and he went with joram the son
of achab king of israel to fight against hazael king of syria at
and he returned to be healed in jezrahel for he received many
wounds in the foresaid battle and ochozias the son of joram king of
sick
for it was the will of god against ochozias that he should come to
so when jehu was rooting out the house of achab he found the
princes of juda and the sons of the brethren of ochozias who served
him and he slew them
and he sought for ochozias himself and took him lying hid in
him because he was the son of josaphat who had sought the lord with
all his heart and there was no more hope that any one should reign of
the race of ochozias
for athalia his mother seeing that her son was dead rose up
and killed all the royal family of the house of joram
but josabeth the kings daughter took joas the son of ochozias
and stole him from among the kings sons that were slain and she hid
him with his nurse in a bedchamber now josabeth that hid him was
daughter of king joram wife of joiada the high priest and sister of
and he was with them hid in the house of god six years during
which athalia reigned over the land
slain and idolatry to be destroyed
and in the seventh year joiada being encouraged took the captains
of hundreds to wit azarias the son of jeroham and ismahel the son of
and they went about juda and gathered together the levites out of
all the cities of juda and the chiefs of the families of israel and
they came to jerusalem
and all the multitude made a covenant with the king in the house
of god and joiada said to them behold the kings son shall reign as
the lord hath said of the sons of david
and this is the thing that you shall do
a third part of you that come to the sabbath of the priests and
of the levites and of the porters shall be at the gates and a third
part at the kings house and a third at the gate that is called the
house of the lord
your office or the weekly watches
and let no one come into the house of the lord but the priests
and they that minister of the levites let them only come in because
they are sanctified and let all the rest of the people keep the watches
of the lord
and let the levites be round about the king every man with his
arms and if any other come into the temple let him be slain and let
them be with the king both coming in and going out
so the levites and all juda did according to all that joiada the
high priest had commanded and they took every one his men that were
under him and that came in by the course of the sabbath with those who
had fulfilled the sabbath and were to go out for joiada the high
priest permitted not the companies to depart which were accustomed to
succeed one another every week
and joiada the priest gave to the captains the spears and the
shields and targets of king david which he had dedicated in the house
of the lord
and he set all the people with swords in their hands from the
right side of the temple to the left side of the temple before the
altar and the temple round about the king
and they brought out the kings son and put the crown upon him
and the testimony and gave him the law to hold in his hand and they
made him king and joiada the high priest and his sons anointed him and
they prayed for him and said god save the king
now when athalia heard the noise of the people running and
praising the king she came in to the people into the temple of the
and when she saw the king standing upon the step in the entrance
and the princes and the companies about him and all the people of the
land rejoicing and sounding with trumpets and playing on instruments
of divers kinds and the voice of those that praised she rent her
garments and said treason treason
and joiada the high priest going out to the captains and the
chiefs of the army said to them take her forth without the precinct of
the temple and when she is without let her be killed with the sword
the lord
and they laid hold on her by the neck and when she was come
within the horse gate of the palace they killed her there
and joiada made a covenant between himself and all the people
and the king that they should be the people of the lord
and all the people went into the house of baal and destroyed it
and they broke down his altars and his idols and they slew mathan the
priest of baal before the altars
and joiada appointed overseers in the house of the lord under
the hands of the priests and the levites whom david had distributed in
the house of the lord to offer holocausts to the lord as it is written
in the law of moses with joy and singing according to the disposition
of david
he appointed also porters in the gates of the house of the lord
that none who was unclean in any thing should enter in
and he took the captains of hundreds and the most valiant men
and the chiefs of the people and all the people of the land and they
brought down the king from the house of the lord and brought him
through the upper gate into the kings house and set him on the royal
throne
and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet
but athalia was slain with the sword
idolatry and causeth zacharias to be slain he is slain himself by his
servants
joas was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned
forty years in jerusalem the name of his mother was sebia of bersabee
and he did that which is good before the lord all the days of
and joiada took for him two wives by whom he had sons and
daughters
after this joas had a mind to repair the house of the lord
and he assembled the priests and the levites and said to them
the temple of your god from year to year and do this with speed but
the levites were negligent
and the king called joiada the chief and said to him why hast
thou not taken care to oblige the levites to bring in out of juda and
for all the multitude of israel to bring into the tabernacle of the
testimony
for that wicked woman athalia and her children have destroyed the
house of god and adorned the temple of baal with all the things that
had been dedicated in the temple of the lord
and the king commanded and they made a chest and set it by the
gate of the house of the lord on the outside
and they made a proclamation in juda and jerusalem that every man
should bring to the lord the money which moses the servant of god
appointed for all israel in the desert
and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and going in
they contributed and cast so much into the chest of the lord that it
was filled
and when it was time to bring the chest before the king by the
hands of the levites for they saw there was much money the kings
scribe and he whom the high priest had appointed went in and they
poured out the money that was in the chest and they carried back the
chest to its place and thus they did from day to day and there was
gathered an immense sum of money
and the king and joiada gave it to those who were over the works
of the house of the lord but they hired with it stonecutters and
artificers of every kind of work to repair the house of the lord and
such as wrought in iron and brass to uphold what began to be falling
and the workmen were diligent and the breach of the walls was
closed up by their hands and they set up the house of the lord in its
former state and made it stand firm
and when they had finished all the works they brought the rest
of the money before the king and joiada and with it were made vessels
for the temple for the ministry and for holocausts and bowls and other
vessels of gold and silver and holocausts were offered in the house of
the lord continually all the days of joiada
but joiada grew old and was full of days and died when he was a
hundred and thirty years old
and they buried him in the city of david among the kings because
he had done good to israel and to his house
and after the death of joiada the princes of juda went in and
worshipped the king and he was soothed by their services and hearkened
to them
and they forsook the temple of the lord the god of their fathers
and served groves and idols and wrath came upon juda and jerusalem for
this sin
and he sent prophets to them to bring them back to the lord and
they would not give ear when they testified against them
the spirit of god then came upon zacharias the son of joiada the
priest and he stood in the sight of the people and said to them thus
saith the lord god why transgress you the commandment of the lord which
will not be for your good and have forsaken the lord to make him
forsake you
and they gathered themselves together against him and stoned him
at the kings commandment in the court of the house of the lord
and king joas did not remember the kindness that joiada his
father had done to him but killed his son and when he died he said
and when a year was come about the army of syria came up against
him and they came to juda and jerusalem and killed all the princes of
the people and they sent all the spoils to the king of damascus
and whereas there came a very small number of the syrians the
forsaken the lord the god of their fathers and on joas they executed
shameful judgments
and departing they left him in great diseases and his servants
rose up against him for revenge of the blood of the son of joiada the
priest and they slew him in his bed and he died and they buried him
in the city of david but not in the sepulchres of the kings
now the men that conspired against him were zabad the son of
and concerning his sons and the sum of money which was gathered
under him and the repairing the house of god they are written more
diligently in the book of kings and amasias his son reigned in his
stead
amasias was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem the name of his mother
was joadan of jerusalem
and he did what was good in the sight of the lord but yet not
with a perfect heart
and when he saw himself strengthened in his kingdom he put to
death the servants that had slain the king his father
but he slew not their children as it is written in the book of
the law of moses where the lord commanded saying the fathers shall
not be slain for the children nor the children for their fathers but
every man shall die for his own sin
amasias therefore gathered juda together and appointed them by
families and captains of thousands and of hundreds in all juda and
found three hundred thousand young men that could go out to battle and
could hold the spear and shield
he hired also of israel a hundred thousand valiant men for a
hundred talents of silver
but a man of god came to him and said o king let not the army
of israel go out with thee for the lord is not with israel and all the
children of ephraim
and if thou think that battles consist in the strength of the
army god will make thee to be overcome by the enemies for it belongeth
to god both to help and to put to flight
and amasias said to the man of god what will then become of the
hundred talents which i have given to the soldiers of israel and the
man of god answered him the lord is rich enough to be able to give thee
much more than this
then amasias separated the army that came to him out of ephraim
to go home again but they being much enraged against juda returned to
their own country
and amasias taking courage led forth his people and went to the
vale of saltpits and slew of the children of seir ten thousand
and other ten thousand men the sons of juda took and brought to
the steep of a certain rock and cast them down headlong from the top
and they all were broken to pieces
but that army which amasias had sent back that they should not
go with him to battle spread themselves among the cities of juda from
spoil
but amasias after he had slain the edomites set up the gods of
the children of seir which he had brought thence to be his gods and
adored them and burnt incense to them
wherefore the lord being angry against amasias sent a prophet to
him to say to him why hast thou adored gods that have not delivered
their own people out of thy hand
and when he spoke these things he answered him art thou the
kings counsellor be quiet lest i kill thee and the prophet
departing said i know that god is minded to kill thee because thou
hast done this evil and moreover hast not hearkened to my counsel
then amasias king of juda taking very bad counsel sent to joas
the son of joachaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us
see one another
but he sent back the messengers saying the thistle that is in
son to wife and behold the beasts that were in the wood of libanus
passed by and trod down the thistle
thou hast said i have overthrown edom and therefore thy heart
is lifted up with pride stay at home why dost thou provoke evil
against thee that both thou shouldst fall and juda with thee
amasias would not hearken to him because it was the lords will
that he should be delivered into the hands of enemies because of the
gods of edom
so joas king of israel went up and they presented themselves to
be seen by one another and amasias king of juda was in bethsames of
and juda fell before israel and they fled to their dwellings
and joas king of israel took amasias king of juda the son of
and broke down the walls thereof from the gate of ephraim to the gate
of the corner four hundred cubits
and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that
he found in the house of god and with obededom and in the treasures of
the kings house moreover also the sons of the hostages he brought
back to samaria
and amasias the son of joas king of juda lived after the death
of joas the son of joachaz king of israel fifteen years
now the rest of the acts of amasias the first and last are
written in the book of the kings of juda and israel
and after he revolted from the lord they made a conspiracy
against him in jerusalem and he fled into lachis and they sent and
killed him there
and they brought him back upon horses and buried him with his
fathers in the city of david
which he is struck with a leprosy
and all the people of juda took his son ozias who was sixteen
years old and made him king in the room of amasias his father
he built ailath and restored it to the dominion of juda after
that the king slept with his fathers
ozias was sixteen years old when he began to reign and he reigned
two and fifty years in jerusalem the name of his mother was jechelia of
and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord according
to all that amasias his father had done
and he sought the lord in the days of zacharias that understood
and saw god and as long as he sought the lord he directed him in all
things
moreover he went forth and fought against the philistines and
broke down the wall of geth and the wall of jabnia and the wall of
and god helped him against the philistines and against the
and the ammonites gave gifts to ozias and his name was spread
abroad even to the entrance of egypt for his frequent victories
and ozias built towers in jerusalem over the gate of the corner
and over the gate of the valley and the rest in the same side of the
wall and fortified them
and he built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns for
he had much cattle both in the plains and in the waste of the desert
he had also vineyards and dressers of vines in the mountains and in
and the army of his fighting men that went out to war was under
the hand of jehiel the scribe and maasias the doctor and under the
hand of henanias who was one of the kings captains
and the whole number of the chiefs by the families of valiant men
were two thousand six hundred
and the whole army under them three hundred and seven thousand
five hundred who were fit for war and fought for the king against the
enemy
and ozias prepared for them that is for the whole army
shields and spears and helmets and coats of mail and bows and
slings to cast stones
and he made in jerusalem engines of diverse kinds which he
placed in the towers and in the corners of the walls to shoot arrows
and great stones and his name went forth far abroad for the lord
helped him and had strengthened him
but when he was made strong his heart was lifted up to his
destruction and he neglected the lord his god and going into the
temple of the lord he had a mind to burn incense upon the altar of
incense
and immediately azarias the priest going in after him and with
him fourscore priests of the lord most valiant men
withstood the king and said it doth not belong to thee ozias
to burn incense to the lord but to the priests that is to the sons of
do not despise for this thing shall not be accounted to thy glory by
the lord god
and ozias was angry and holding in his hand the censer to burn
incense threatened the priests and presently there rose a leprosy in
his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord at the altar
of incense
and azarias the high priest and all the rest of the priests
looked upon him and saw the leprosy in his forehead and they made
haste to thrust him out yea himself also being frightened hasted to go
out because he had quickly felt the stroke of the lord
and ozias the king was a leper unto the day of his death and he
dwelt in a house apart being full of the leprosy for which he had been
cast out of the house of the lord and joatham his son governed the
kings house and judged the people of the land
but the rest of the acts of ozias first and last were written by
and ozias slept with his fathers and they buried him in the
field of the royal sepulchres because he was a leper and joatham his
son reigned in his stead
joatham was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem the name of his mother was jerusa
the daughter of sadoc
and he did that which was right before the lord according to all
that ozias his father had done only that he entered not into the temple
of the lord and the people still transgressed
he built the high gate of the house of the lord and on the wall
of ophel he built much
moreover he built cities in the mountains of juda and castles and
towers in the forests
he fought against the king of the children of ammon and overcame
them and the children of ammon gave him at that time a hundred talents
of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and as many measures of
barley so much did the children of ammon give him in the second and
third year
and joatham was strengthened because he had his way directed
before the lord his god
now the rest of the acts of joatham and all his wars and his
works are written in the book of the kings of israel and juda
he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and he
reigned sixteen years in jerusalem
and joatham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the
city of david and achaz his son reigned in his stead
achaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned
sixteen years in jerusalem he did not that which was right in the sight
of the lord as david his father had done
but walked in the ways of the kings of israel moreover also he
cast statues for baalim
it was he that burnt incense in the valley of benennom and
consecrated his sons in the fire according to the manner of the nations
which the lord slew at the coming of the children of israel
he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on
the hills and under every green tree
and the lord his god delivered him into the hands of the king of
carried it to damascus he was also delivered into the hands of the king
of israel who overthrew him with a great slaughter
for phacee the son of romelia slew of juda a hundred and twenty
thousand in one day all valiant men because they had forsaken the lord
the god of their fathers
at the same time zechri a powerful man of ephraim slew maasias
the kings son and ezricam the governor of his house and elcana who
was next to the king
and the children of israel carried away of their brethren two
hundred thousand women boys and girls and an immense booty and they
brought it to samaria
at that time there was a prophet of the lord there whose name was
them behold the lord the god of your fathers being angry with juda
hath delivered them into your hands and you have butchered them
cruelly so that your cruelty hath reached up to heaven
moreover you have a mind to keep under the children of juda and
for you have sinned in this against the lord your god
but hear ye my counsel and release the captives that you have
brought of your brethren because a great indignation of the lord
hangeth over you
then some of the chief men of the sons of ephraim azarias the
son of johanan barachias the son of mosollamoth ezechias the son of
the war
and they said to them you shall not bring in the captives
hither lest we sin against the lord why will you add to our sins and
heap up upon our former offences for the sin is great and the fierce
anger of the lord hangeth over israel
so the soldiers left the spoils and all that they had taken
before the princes and all the multitude
and the men whom we mentioned above rose up and took the
captives and with the spoils clothed all them that were naked and when
they had clothed and shod them and refreshed them with meat and drink
and anointed them because of their labour and had taken care of them
they set such of them as could not walk and were feeble upon beasts
and brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren
and they returned to samaria
at that time king achaz sent to the king of the assyrians asking
help
and the edomites came and slew many of juda and took a great
booty
the philistines also spread themselves among the cities of the
plains and to the south of juda and they took bethsames and aialon
and gaderoth and socho and thamnan and gamzo with their villages
and they dwelt in them
for the lord had humbled juda because of achaz the king of juda
for he had stripped it of help and had contemned the lord
idolatry
and he brought against him thelgathphalnasar king of the
resistance
and achaz stripped the house of the lord and the house of the
kings and of the princes and gave gifts to the king of the assyrians
and yet it availed him nothing
moreover also in the time of his distress he increased contempt
against the lord king achaz himself by himself
sacrificed victims to the gods of damascus that struck him and
he said the gods of the kings of syria help them and i will appease
them with victims and they will help me whereas on the contrary they
were the ruin of him and of all israel
then achaz having taken away all the vessels of the house of god
and broken them shut up the doors of the temple of god and made
himself altars in all the corners of jerusalem
and in all the cities of juda he built altars to burn
frankincense and he provoked the lord the god of his fathers to wrath
but the rest of his acts and all his works first and last are
written in the book of the kings of juda and israel
and achaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city
of jerusalem for they received him not into the sepulchres of the kings
of israel and ezechias his son reigned in his stead
now ezechias began to reign when he was five and twenty years
old and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem the name of his
mother was abia the daughter of zacharias
and he did that which was pleasing in the sight of the lord
according to all that david his father had done
in the first year and month of his reign he opened the doors of
the house of the lord and repaired them
and he brought the priests and the levites and assembled them in
the east street
and he said to them hear me ye levites and be sanctified
purify the house of the lord the god of your fathers and take away all
filth out of the sanctuary
our fathers have sinned and done evil in the sight of the lord
tabernacle of the lord and turned their backs
they have shut up the doors that were in the porch and put out
the lamps and have not burnt incense nor offered holocausts in the
sanctuary of the god of israel
therefore the wrath of the lord hath been stirred up against juda
and jerusalem and he hath delivered them to trouble and to
destruction and to be hissed at as you see with your eyes
behold our fathers are fallen by the sword our sons and our
daughters and wives are led away captives for this wickedness
now therefore i have a mind that we make a covenant with the lord
the god of israel and he will turn away the wrath of his indignation
from us
my sons be not negligent the lord hath chosen you to stand
before him and to minister to him and to worship him and to burn
incense to him
then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the
son of azarias of the sons of caath and of the sons of merari cis the
son of abdi and azarias the son of jalaleel and of the sons of gerson
and of the sons of elisaphan samri and jahiel also of the sons
of asaph zacharias and mathanias
and of the sons of heman jahiel and semei and of the sons of
and they gathered together their brethren and sanctified
themselves and went in according to the commandment of the king and
the precept of the lord to purify the house of god
and the priests went into the temple of the lord to sanctify it
and brought out all the uncleanness that they found within to the
entrance of the house of the lord and the levites took it away and
carried it out abroad to the torrent cedron
and they began to cleanse on the first day of the first month
and on the eighth day of the same month they came into the porch of the
temple of the lord and they purified the temple in eight days and on
the sixteenth day of the same month they finished what they had begun
and they went in to king ezechias and said to him we have
sanctified all the house of the lord and the altar of holocaust and
the vessels thereof and the table of proposition with all its vessels
and all the furniture of the temple which king achaz in his
reign had defiled after his transgression and behold they are all set
forth before the altar of the lord
and king ezechias rising early assembled all the rulers of the
city and went up into the house of the lord
and they offered together seven bullocks and seven rams and
seven lambs and seven hegoats for sin for the kingdom for the
sanctuary for juda and he spoke to the priests the sons of aaron to
offer them upon the altar of the lord
therefore they killed the bullocks and the priests took the
blood and poured it upon the altar they killed also the rams and
their blood they poured also upon the altar and they killed the lambs
and poured the blood upon the altar
and they brought the hegoats for sin before the king and the
whole multitude and they laid their hand upon them
and the priests immolated them and sprinkled their blood before
the altar for an expiation of all israel for the king had commanded
that the holocaust and the sin offering should be made for all israel
and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals and
psalteries and harps according to the regulation of david the king and
of gad the seer and of nathan the prophet for it was the commandment
of the lord by the hand of his prophets
and the levites stood with the instruments of david and the
priests with trumpets
and ezechias commanded that they should offer holocausts upon the
altar and when the holocausts were offered they began to sing praises
to the lord and to sound with trumpets and divers instruments which
and all the multitude adored and the singers and the
trumpeters were in their office till the holocaust was finished
and when the oblation was ended the king and all that were with
him bowed down and adored
and ezechias and the princes commanded the levites to praise the
with great joy and bowing the knee adored
and ezechias added and said you have filled your hands to the
all the multitude offered victims and praises and holocausts with a
devout mind
and the number of the holocausts which the multitude offered was
seventy bullocks a hundred rams and two hundred lambs
and they consecrated to the lord six hundred oxen and three
thousand sheep
but the priests were few and were not enough to flay the
holocausts wherefore the levites their brethren helped them till the
work was ended and priests were sanctified for the levites are
sanctified with an easier rite than the priests
so there were many holocausts and the fat of peace offerings
and the libations of holocausts and the service of the house of the
and ezechias and all the people rejoiced because the ministry of
the lord was accomplished for the resolution of doing this thing was
taken suddenly
kept fourteen days
and ezechias sent to all israel and juda and he wrote letters to
for the king taking counsel and the princes and all the
assembly of jerusalem decreed to keep the phase the second month
for they could not keep it in its time because there were not
priests enough sanctified and the people was not as yet gathered
together to jerusalem
and the thing pleased the king and all the people
and they decreed to send messengers to all israel from bersabee
even to dan that they should come and keep the phase to the lord the
by the law
and the posts went with letters by commandment of the king and
his princes to all israel and juda proclaiming according to the kings
orders ye children of israel turn again to the lord the god of
of you that have escaped the hand of the king of the assyrians
be not like your fathers and brethren who departed from the lord
the god of their fathers and he hath given them up to destruction as
you see
harden not your necks as your fathers did yield yourselves to
the lord and come to his sanctuary which he hath sanctified forever
serve the lord the god of your fathers and the wrath of his indignation
shall be turned away from you
for if you turn again to the lord your brethren and children
shall find mercy before their masters that have led them away captive
and they shall return into this land for the lord your god is merciful
and will not turn away his face from you if you return to him
so the posts went speedily from city to city through the land of
and mocked them
nevertheless some men of aser and of manasses and of zabulon
yielding to the counsel came to jerusalem
but the hand of god was in juda to give them one heart to do the
word of the lord according to the commandment of the king and of the
princes
and much people were assembled to jerusalem to celebrate the
solemnity of the unleavened bread in the second month
and they arose and destroyed the altars that were in jerusalem
and took away all things in which incense was burnt to idols and cast
them into the torrent cedron
and they immolated the phase on the fourteenth day of the second
month and the priests and the levites being at length sanctified
offered holocausts in the house of the lord
and they stood in their order according to the disposition and
law of moses the man of god but the priests received the blood which
was to be poured out from the hands of the levites
because a great number was not sanctified and therefore the
sanctified to the lord
for a great part of the people from ephraim and manasses and
otherwise than it is written and ezechias prayed for them saying the
to all them who with their whole heart seek the lord the god of
their fathers and will not impute it to them that they are not
sanctified
and the lord heard him and was merciful to the people
and the children of israel that were found at jerusalem kept
the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great joy praising the
agreed to their office
and ezechias spoke to the heart of all the levites that had good
understanding concerning the lord and they ate during the seven days of
the solemnity immolating victims of peace offerings and praising the
and it pleased the whole multitude to keep other seven days
which they did with great joy
for ezechias the king of juda had given to the multitude a
thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes had given
the people a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a great
number of priests was sanctified
and all the multitude of juda with the priests and levites and
all the assembly that came out of israel and the proselytes of the
land of israel and that dwelt in juda were full of joy
and there was a great solemnity in jerusalem such as had not
been in that city since the time of solomon the son of david king of
and the priests and the levites rose up and blessed the people
and their voice was heard and their prayer came to the holy dwelling
place of heaven
and when these things had been duly celebrated all israel that
were found in the cities of juda went out and they broke the idols
and cut down the groves demolished the high places and destroyed the
altars not only out of all juda and benjamin but out of ephraim also
and manasses till they had utterly destroyed them then all the
children of israel returned to their possessions and cities
and ezechias appointed companies of the priests and the levites
by their courses every man in his own office to wit both of the
priests and of the levites for holocausts and for peace offerings to
minister and to praise and to sing in the gates of the camp of the
and the kings part was that of his proper substance the
holocaust should be offered always morning and evening and on the
sabbaths and the new moons and the other solemnities as it is written
in the law of moses
he commanded also the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give to
the priests and the levites their portion that they might attend to
the law of the lord
which when it was noised abroad in the ears of the people the
children of israel offered in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine
and oil and honey and brought the tithe of all things which the ground
bringeth forth
moreover the children of israel and juda that dwelt in the cities
of juda brought in the tithes of oxen and sheep and the tithes of
holy things which they had vowed to the lord their god and carrying
them all made many heaps
in the third month they began to lay the foundations of the heaps
and in the seventh month they finished them
and when ezechias and his princes came in they saw the heaps and
they blessed the lord and the people of israel
and ezechias asked the priests and the levites why the heaps lay
so
azarias the chief priest of the race of sadoc answered him
saying since the firstfruits began to be offered in the house of the
because the lord hath blessed his people and of that which is left is
this great store which thou seest
then ezechias commanded to prepare storehouses in the house of
the lord and when they had done so
they brought in faithfully both the firstfruits and the tithes
and all they had vowed and the overseer of them was chonenias the
and after him jehiel and azarias and nahath and asael and
by the commandment of ezechias the king and azarias the high priest of
the house of god to whom all things appertained
but core the son of jemna the levite the porter of the east
gate was overseer of the things which were freely offered to the lord
and of the firstfruits and the things dedicated for the holy of holies
and under his charge were eden and benjamin jesue and semeias
and amarias and sechenias in the cities of the priests to distribute
faithfully portions to their brethren both little and great
besides the males from three years old and upward to all that
went into the temple of the lord and whatsoever there was need of in
the ministry and their offices according to their courses day by day
to the priests by their families and to the levites from the
twentieth year and upward by their classes and companies
and to all the multitude both to their wives and to their
children of both sexes victuals were given faithfully out of the things
that had been sanctified
also of the sons of aaron who were in the fields and in the
suburbs of each city there were men appointed to distribute portions
to all the males among the priests and the levites
so ezechias did all things which we have said in all juda and
wrought that which was good and right and truth before the lord his
in all the service of the house of the lord according to the law
and the ceremonies desiring to seek his god with all his heart and he
did it and prospered
recovereth from his sickness his other acts
after these things and this truth sennacherib king of the
desiring to take them
and when ezechias saw that sennacherib was come and that the whole
force of the war was turning against jerusalem
he took counsel with the princes and the most valiant men to stop
up the heads of the springs that were without the city and as they
were all of this mind
he gathered together a very great multitude and they stopped up
all the springs and the brook that ran through the midst of the land
saying lest the kings of the assyrians should come and find abundance
of water
he built up also with great diligence all the wall that had been
broken down and built towers upon it and another wall without and he
repaired mello in the city of david and made all sorts of arms and
shields
and he appointed captains of the soldiers of the army and he
called them all together in the street of the gate of the city and spoke
to their heart saying
behave like men and take courage be not afraid nor dismayed for
the king of the assyrians nor for all the multitude that is with him
for there are many more with us than with him
for with him is an arm of flesh with us the lord our god who is
our helper and fighteth for us and the people were encouraged with
these words of ezechias king of juda
after this sennacherib king of the assyrians sent his servants to
king of juda and to all the people that were in the city saying
thus saith sennacherib king of the assyrians in whom do you
trust that you sit still besieged in jerusalem
doth not ezechias deceive you to give you up to die by hunger and
thirst affirming that the lord your god shall deliver you from the hand
of the king of the assyrians
is it not this same ezechias that hath destroyed his high places
and his altars and commanded juda and jerusalem saying you shall
worship before one altar and upon it you shall burn incense
know you not what i and my fathers have done to all the people of
the lands have the gods of any nations and lands been able to deliver
their country out of my hand
who is there among all the gods of the nations which my fathers
have destroyed that could deliver his people out of my hand that your
therefore let not ezechias deceive you nor delude you with a vain
persuasion and do not believe him for if no god of all the nations and
kingdoms could deliver his people out of my hand and out of the hand of
my fathers consequently neither shall your god be able to deliver you
out of my hand
and many other things did his servants speak against the lord god
and against ezechias his servant
he wrote also letters full of blasphemy against the lord the god
of israel and he spoke against him as the gods of other nations could
not deliver their people out of my hand so neither can the god of
moreover he cried out with a loud voice in the jews tongue to
the people that sat on the walls of jerusalem that he might frighten
them and take the city
and he spoke against the god of jerusalem as against the gods of
the people of the earth the works of the hands of men
and ezechias the king and isaias the prophet the son of amos
prayed against this blasphemy and cried out to heaven
and the lord sent an angel who cut off all the stout men and the
warriors and the captains of the army of the king of the assyrians and
he returned with disgrace into his own country and when he was come
into the house of his god his sons that came out of his bowels slew him
with the sword
and the lord saved ezechias and the inhabitants of jerusalem out
of the hand of sennacherib king of the assyrians and out of the hand of
all and gave them treasures on every side
many also brought victims and sacrifices to the lord to
thenceforth in the sight of all nations
in those days ezechias was sick even to death and he prayed to
the lord and he heard him and gave him a sign
but he did not render again according to the benefits which he had
received for his heart was lifted up and wrath was enkindled against
him and against juda and jerusalem
and he humbled himself afterwards because his heart had been
lifted up both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem and therefore the
wrath of the lord came not upon them in the days of ezechias
and ezechias was rich and very glorious and he gathered himself
great treasures of silver and of gold and of precious stones of spices
and of arms of all kinds and of vessels of great price
storehouses also of corn of wine and of oil and stalls for all
beasts and folds for cattle
and he built himself cities for he had flocks of sheep and
herds without number for the lord had given him very much substance
this same ezechias was he that stopped the upper source of the
waters of gihon and turned them away underneath toward the west of the
city of david in all his works he did prosperously what he would
but yet in the embassy of the princes of babylon that were sent
to him to inquire of the wonder that had happened upon the earth god
left him that he might be tempted and all things might be made known
that were in his heart
now the rest of the acts of ezechias and of his mercies are
written in the book of the kings of juda and israel
and ezechias slept with his fathers and they buried him above the
sepulchres of the sons of david and all juda and all the inhabitants
of jerusalem celebrated his funeral and manasses his son reigned in his
stead
repenteth and is restored to his kingdom and destroyeth idolatry his
successor amon is slain by his servants
manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign and he
reigned fiftyfive years in jerusalem
and he did evil before the lord according to all the abominations
of the nations which the lord cast out before the children of israel
and he turned and built again the high places which ezechias his
father had destroyed and he built altars to baalim and made groves
and he adored all the host of heaven and worshipped them
he built also altars in the house of the lord whereof the lord
had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever
and he built them for all the host of heaven in the two courts of
the house of the lord
and he made his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of
magic arts had with him magicians and enchanters and he wrought many
evils before the lord to provoke him to anger
he set also a graven and a molten statue in the house of god of
which god had said to david and to solomon his son in this house and
in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel will
and i will not make the foot of israel to be removed out of the
land which i have delivered to their fathers yet so if they will take
heed to do what i have commanded them and all the law and the
ceremonies and judgments by the hand of moses
so manasses seduced juda and the inhabitants of jerusalem to do
evil beyond all the nations which the lord had destroyed before the
face of the children of israel
and the lord spoke to his people and they would not hearken
therefore he brought upon them the captains of the army of the
king of the assyrians and they took manasses and carried him bound
with chains and fetters to babylon
and after that he was in distress he prayed to the lord his god
and did penance exceedingly before the god of his fathers
and he entreated him and besought him earnestly and he heard
his prayer and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom and
after this he built a wall without the city of david on the west
side of gihon in the valley from the entering in of the gate round
about to ophel and raised it up to a great height and he appointed
captains of the army in all the fenced cities of juda
and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house
of the lord the altars also which he had made in the mount of the house
of the lord and in jerusalem and he cast them all out of the city
and he repaired the altar of the lord and sacrificed upon it
victims and peace offerings and praise and he commanded juda to serve
the lord the god of israel
nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places to
the lord their god
but the rest of the acts of manasses and his prayer to his god
and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the lord the
his prayer also and his being heard and all his sins and
contempt and places wherein he built high places and set up groves
and statues before he did penance are written in the words of hozai
and manasses slept with his fathers and they buried him in his
house and his son amon reigned in his stead
amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign and he
reigned two years in jerusalem
and he did evil in the sight of the lord as manasses his father
had done he sacrificed to all the idols which manasses his father had
made and served them
and he did not humble himself before the lord as manasses his
father had humbled himself but committed far greater sin
and his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own
house
but the rest of the multitude of the people slew them that had
killed amon and made josias his son king in his stead
covenant between god and the people
josias was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned
one and thirty years in jerusalem
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and
walked in the ways of david his father he declined not neither to the
right hand nor to the left
and in the eighth year of his reign when he was yet a boy he
began to seek the god of his father david and in the twelfth year after
he began to reign he cleansed juda and jerusalem from the high places
and the groves and the idols and the graven things
and they broke down before him the altars of baalim and
demolished the idols that had been set upon them and he cut down the
groves and the graven things and broke them in pieces and strewed the
fragments upon the graves of them that had sacrificed to them
and he burnt the bones of the priests on the altars of the idols
and he cleansed juda and jerusalem
and in the cities of manasses and of ephraim and of simeon even
to nephtali he demolished all
and when he had destroyed the altars and the groves and had
broken the idols in pieces and had demolished all profane temples
throughout all the land of israel he returned to jerusalem
now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had cleansed the
land and the temple of the lord he sent saphan the son of elselias
and maasias the governor of the city joha the son of joachaz the
recorder to repair the house of the lord his god
and they came to helcias the high priest and received of him the
money which had been brought into the house of the lord and which the
and all the remnant of israel and from all juda and benjamin and the
inhabitants of jerusalem
which they delivered into the hands of them that were over the
workmen in the house of the lord to repair the temple and mend all
that was weak
but they gave it to the artificers and to the masons to buy
stones out of the quarries and timber for the couplings of the
building and to rafter the houses which the kings of juda had
destroyed
and they did all faithfully now the overseers of the workmen
were jahath and abdias of the sons of merari zacharias and mosollam of
the sons of caath who hastened the work all levites skilful to play on
instruments
but over them that carried burdens for divers uses were scribes
and masters of the number of the levites and porters
now when they carried out the money that had been brought into
the temple of the lord helcias the priest found the book of the law of
the lord by the hand of moses
and he said to saphan the scribe i have found the book of the
law in the house of the lord and he delivered it to him
but he carried the book to the king and told him saying lo
all that thou hast committed to thy servants is accomplished
they have gathered together the silver that was found in the
house of the lord and it is given to the overseers of the artificers
and of the workmen for divers works
moreover helcias the priest gave me this book and he read it
before the king
and when he had heard the words of the law he rent his garments
and he commanded helcias and ahicam the son of saphan and abdon
the son of micha and saphan the scribe and asaa the kings servant
saying
go and pray to the lord for me and for the remnant of israel
and juda concerning all the words of this book which is found for the
great wrath of the lord hath fallen upon us because our fathers have
not kept the words of the lord to do all things that are written in
this book
and helcias and they that were sent with him by the king went to
and they spoke to her the words above mentioned
and she answered them thus saith the lord the god of israel
thus saith the lord behold i will bring evils upon this place
and upon the inhabitants thereof and all the curses that are written in
this book which they read before the king of juda
because they have forsaken me and have sacrificed to strange
gods to provoke me to wrath with all the works of their hands
therefore my wrath shall fail upon this place and shall not be
quenched
but as to the king of juda that sent you to beseech the lord
thus shall you say to him thus saith the lord the god of israel
and thy heart was softened and thou hast humbled thyself in the
sight of god for the things that are spoken against this place and the
inhabitants of jerusalem and reverencing my face hast rent thy
garments and wept before me i also have heard thee saith the lord
for now i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be
brought to thy tomb in peace and thy eyes shall not see all the evil
that i will bring upon this place and the inhabitants thereof they
therefore reported to the king all that she had said
and he called together all the ancients of juda and jerusalem
and went up to the house of the lord and all the men of juda
and the inhabitants of jerusalem the priests and the levites and all
the people from the least to the greatest and the king read in their
hearing in the house of the lord all the words of the book
and standing up in his tribunal he made a covenant before the
justifications with all his heart and with all his soul and to do the
things that were written in that book which he had read
and he adjured all that were found in jerusalem and benjamin to
do the same and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the
covenant of the lord the god of their fathers
and josias took away all the abominations out of all the
countries of the children of israel and made all that were left in
not from the lord the god of their fathers
and josias kept a phase to the lord in jerusalem and it was
sacrificed on the fourteenth day of the first month
and he set the priests in their offices and exhorted them to
minister in the house of the lord
and he spoke to the levites by whose instruction all israel was
sanctified to the lord saying put the ark in the sanctuary of the
temple which solomon the son of david king of israel built for you
shall carry it no more but minister now to the lord your god and to
his people israel
and prepare yourselves by your houses and families according to
your courses as david king of israel commanded and solomon his son
hath written
and serve ye in the sanctuary by the families and companies of
and being sanctified kill the phase and prepare your brethren
that they may do according to the words which the lord spoke by the hand
of moses
and josias gave to all the people that were found there in the
solemnity of the phase of lambs and of kids of the flocks and of other
small cattle thirty thousand and of oxen three thousand all these were
of the kings substance
and his princes willingly offered what they had vowed both to the
people and to the priests and the levites moreover helcias and
priests to keep the phase two thousand six hundred small cattle and
three hundred oxen
and chonenias and semeias and nathanael his brethren and
rest of the levites to celebrate the phase five thousand small cattle
and five hundred oxen
and the ministry was prepared and the priests stood in their
office the levites also in their companies according to the kings
commandment
and the phase was immolated and the priests sprinkled the blood
with their hand and the levites flayed the holocausts
and they separated them to give them by the houses and families
of every one and to be offered to the lord as it is written in the
book of moses and with the oxen they did in like manner
and they roasted the phase with fire according to that which is
written in the law but the victims of peace offerings they boiled in
caldrons and kettles and pots and they distributed them speedily
among all the people
and afterwards they made ready for themselves and for the
priests for the priests were busied in offering of holocausts and the
fat until night wherefore the levites prepared for themselves and for
the priests the sons of aaron last
and the singers the sons of asaph stood in their order according
to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and idithun the
prophets of the king and the porters kept guard at every gate so as
not to depart one moment from their service and therefore their
brethren the levites prepared meats for them
so all the service of the lord was duly accomplished that day
both in keeping the phase and offering holocausts upon the altar of the
and the children of israel that were found there kept the phase
at that time and the feast of unleavened seven days
there was no phase like to this in israel from the days of
a phase as josias kept with the priests and the levites and all juda
and israel that were found and the inhabitants of jerusalem
in the eighteenth year of the reign of josias was this phase
celebrated
after that josias had repaired the temple nechao king of egypt
came up to fight in charcamis by the euphrates and josias went out to
meet him
but he sent messengers to him saying what have i to do with
thee o king of juda i come not against thee this day but i fight
against another house to which god hath commanded me to go in haste
forbear to do against god who is with me lest he kill thee
josias would not return but prepared to fight against him and
hearkened not to the words of nechao from the mouth of god but went to
fight in the field of mageddo
and there he was wounded by the archers and he said to his
servants carry me out of the battle for i am grievously wounded
and they removed him from the chariot into another that followed
him after the manner of kings and they carried him away to jerusalem
and he died and was buried in the monument of his fathers and all juda
and jerusalem mourned for him
particularly jeremias whose lamentations for josias all the
singing men and singing women repeat unto this day and it became like a
law in israel behold it is found written in the lamentations
now the rest of the acts of josias and of his mercies according
to what was commanded by the law of the lord
and his works first and last are written in the book of the
kings of juda and israel
then the people of the land took joachaz the son of josias and
made him king instead of his father in jerusalem
joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned three months in jerusalem
and the king of egypt came to jerusalem and deposed him and
condemned the land in a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
and he made eliakim his brother king in his stead over juda and
him and carried him away into egypt
joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did evil before the lord
his god
against him came up nabuchodonosor king of the chaldeans and led
him bound in chains into babylon
and he carried also thither the vessels of the lord and put them
in his temple
but the rest of the acts of joakim and his abominations which he
wrought and the things that were found in him are contained in the
book of the kings of juda and israel and joachin his son reigned in his
stead
joachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned
three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did evil in the sight of
the lord
he was but eight years old but after his fathers death when he
reigned alone he was eighteen years old kings
and at the return of the year king nabuchodonosor sent and
brought him to babylon carrying away at the same time the most precious
vessels of the house of the lord and he made sedecias his uncle king
over juda and jerusalem
sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned eleven years in jerusalem
and he did evil in the eyes of the lord his god and did not
reverence the face of jeremias the prophet speaking to him from the
mouth of the lord
he also revolted from king nabuchodonosor who had made him swear
by god and he hardened his neck and his heart from returning to the
moreover all the chief of the priests and the people wickedly
transgressed according to all the abominations of the gentiles and they
defiled the house of the lord which he had sanctified to himself in
and the lord the god of their fathers sent to them by the hand
of his messengers rising early and daily admonishing them because he
spared his people and his dwelling place
but they mocked the messengers of god and despised his words
and misused the prophets until the wrath of the lord arose against his
people and there was no remedy
for he brought upon them the king of the chaldeans and he slew
their young men with the sword in the house of his sanctuary he had no
compassion on young man or maiden old man or even him that stooped for
age but he delivered them all into his hands
and all the vessels of the house of lord great and small and
the treasures of the temple and of the king and of the princes he
carried away to babylon
and the enemies set fire to the house of god and broke down the
wall of jerusalem burnt all the towers and what soever was precious
they destroyed
whosoever escaped the sword was led into babylon and there
served the king and his sons till the reign of the king of persia
that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremias might be
fulfilled and the land might keep her sabbaths for all the days of the
desolation she kept a sabbath till the seventy years were expired
but in the first year of cyrus king of the persians to fulfil
the word of the lord which he had spoken by the mouth of jeremias the
it to be proclaimed through all his kingdom and by writing also
saying
thus saith cyrus king of the persians all the kingdoms of the
earth hath the lord the god of heaven given to me and he hath charged
me to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judea who is there
among you of all his people the lord his god be with him and let him
go up
doctor of the law he is called by the hebrews ezra
