and the lord called moses and spoke to him from the tabernacle of
the testimony saying
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say to them the
man among you that shall offer to the lord a sacrifice of the cattle
that is offering victims of oxen and sheep
if his offering be a holocaust and of the herd he shall offer a
male without blemish at the door of the testimony to make the lord
favourable to him
because the whole victim was consumed with fire and given in such
manner to god as wholly to evaporate as it were for his honour and
glory without having any part of it reserved for the use of man the
other sacrifices in the old testament were either offerings for sin or
peace offerings and these latter again were either offered in
thanksgiving for blessings received or by way of prayer for new favours
or graces so that sacrifices were then offered to god for four
different ends or intentions answerable to the different obligations
which man has to god by way of adoration homage praise and glory
due to his divine majesty by way of thanksgiving for all benefits
received from him by way of confessing and craving pardon for sins
by way of prayer and petition for grace and relief in all
necessities in the new law we have but one sacrifice viz that of the
body and blood of christ but this one sacrifice of the new testament
perfectly answers all these four ends and both priest and people as
often as it is celebrated ought to join in offering it up for these
four ends
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim and it shall
be acceptable and help to its expiation
and he shall immolate the calf before the lord and the priests the
sons of aaron shall offer the blood thereof pouring it round about the
altar which is before the door of the tabernacle
and when they have flayed the victim they shall cut the joints
into pieces
and shall put fire on the altar having before laid in order a pile
of wood
and they shall lay the parts that are cut out in order thereupon
to wit the head and all things that cleave to the liver
the entrails and feet being washed with water and the priest shall
burn them upon the altar for a holocaust and a sweet savour to the
and if the offering be of the flocks a holocaust of sheep or of
goats he shall offer a male without blemish
and he shall immolate it at the side of the altar that looketh to
the north before the lord but the sons of aaron shall pour the blood
thereof upon the altar round about
and they shall divide the joints the head and all that cleave to
the liver and shall lay them upon the wood under which the fire is to
be put
but the entrails and the feet they shall wash with water and the
priest shall offer it all and burn it all upon the altar for a
holocaust and most sweet savour to the lord
but if the oblation of a holocaust to the lord be of birds of
turtles or of young pigeons
the priest shall offer it at the altar and twisting back the
neck and breaking the place of the wound he shall make the blood run
down upon the brim of the altar
but the crop of the throat and the feathers he shall cast beside
the altar at the east side in the place where the ashes are wont to be
poured out
and he shall break the pinions thereof and shall not cut nor
divide it with a knife and shall burn it upon the altar putting fire
under the wood it is a holocaust and oblation of most sweet savour to
the lord
when any one shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the lord his
offering shall be of fine flour and he shall pour oil upon it and put
frankincense
and shall bring it to the sons of aaron the priests and one of
them shall take a handful of the flour and oil and all the
frankincense and shall put it a memorial upon the altar for a most
sweet savour to the lord
and the remnant of the sacrifice shall be aarons and his sons
holy of holies of the offerings of the lord
aside by his ordinance for the use of his priests
but when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in the oven of flour to
wit loaves without leaven tempered with oil and unleavened wafers
anointed with oil
if thy oblation be from the fryingpan of flour tempered with oil
and without leaven
thou shalt divide it into little pieces and shalt pour oil upon
it
and if the sacrifice be from the gridiron in like manner the flour
shall be tempered with oil
and when thou offerest it to the lord thou shalt deliver it to the
hands of the priest
and when he hath offered it he shall take a memorial out of the
sacrifice and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to the lord
and whatsoever is left shall be aarons and his sons holy of
holies of the offerings of the lord
every oblation that is offered to the lord shall be made without
leaven neither shall any leaven or honey be burnt in the sacrifice to
the lord
sacrifice offered to god to signify that we are to exclude from the
pure worship of the gospel all double dealing and affection to carnal
pleasures
you shall offer only the firstfruits of them and gifts but they
shall not be put upon the altar for a savour of sweetness
whatsoever sacrifice thou offerest thou shalt season it with
salt neither shalt thou take away the salt of the covenant of thy god
from thy sacrifice in all thy oblations thou shalt offer salt
wisdom and discretion without which none of our performances are
agreeable to god
but if thou offer a gift of the firstfruits of thy corn to the
small like meal and so shalt thou offer thy firstfruits to the lord
pouring oil upon it and putting on frankincense because it is the
oblation of the lord
whereof the priest shall burn for a memorial of the gift part of
the corn broken small and of the oil and all the frankincense
and if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offerings and he will
offer of the herd whether male or female he shall offer them without
blemish before the lord
happiness welfare or prosperity in a word all kind of blessingssuch
sacrifices therefore as were offered either on occasion of blessings
received or to obtain new favours were called pacific or peace
offerings in these some part of the victim was consumed with fire on
the altar of god other parts were eaten by the priests and by the
persons for whom the sacrifice was offered
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his victim which shall
be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony and the sons
of aaron the priests shall pour the blood round about upon the altar
and they shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings for an
oblation to the lord the fat that covereth the entrails and all the
fat that is within
the two kidneys with the fat wherewith the flanks are covered and
the caul of the liver with the two little kidneys
and they shall burn them upon the altar for a holocaust putting
fire under the wood for an oblation of most sweet savour to the lord
but if his oblation and the sacrifice of peace offering be of the
flock whether he offer male or female they shall be without blemish
if he offer a lamb before the lord
he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim and it shall be
slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony and the sons of
and they shall offer of the victim of peace offerings a sacrifice
to the lord the fat and the whole rump
with the kidneys and the fat that covereth the belly and all the
vitals and both the little kidneys with the fat that is about the
flanks and the caul of the liver with the little kidneys
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for the food of the
fire and of the oblation of the lord
if his offering be a goat and he offer it to the lord
he shall put his hand upon the head thereof and shall immolate it
in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony and the sons of aaron
shall pour the blood thereof round about upon the altar
and they shall take of it for the food of the lords fire the fat
that covereth the belly and that covereth all the vital parts
the two little kidneys with the caul that is upon them which is by
the flanks and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for the food of the
fire and of a most sweet savour all the fat shall be the lords
by a perpetual law for your generations and in all your
habitations neither blood nor fat shall you eat at all
to be offered on gods altar not of the fat of meat such as we
commonly eat
and the lord spoke to moses saying
say to the children of israel the soul that sinneth through
ignorance and doth any thing concerning any of the commandments of the
for such culpable ignorance these sacrifices prescribed in this and
the following chapter were appointed
if the priest that is anointed shall sin making the people to
offend he shall offer to the lord for his sin a calf without blemish
and he shall bring it to the door of the testimony before the lord
and shall put his hand upon the head thereof and shall sacrifice it to
the lord
he shall take also of the blood of the calf and carry it into the
tabernacle of the testimony
of our sins and carried by him into the sanctuary of heaven
and having dipped his finger in the blood he shall sprinkle with
it seven times before the lord before the veil of the sanctuary
and he shall put some of the same blood upon the horns of the altar
of the sweet incense most acceptable to the lord which is in the
tabernacle of the testimony and he shall pour all the rest of the blood
at the foot of the altar of holocaust in the entry of the tabernacle
and he shall take off the fat of the calf for the sin offering as
well that which covereth the entrails as all the inwards
the two little kidneys and the caul that is upon them which is by
the flanks and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys
as it is taken off from the calf of the sacrifice of peace
offerings and he shall burn them upon the altar of holocaust
but the skin and all the flesh with the head and the feet and the
bowels and the dung
and the rest of the body he shall carry forth without the camp
into a clean place where the ashes are wont to be poured out and he
shall burn them upon a pile of wood they shall be burnt in the place
where the ashes are poured out
and if all the multitude of israel shall be ignorant and through
ignorance shall do that which is against the commandment of the lord
and afterwards shall understand their sin they shall offer for
their sin a calf and shall bring it to the door of the tabernacle
and the ancients of the people shall put their hands upon the head
thereof before the lord and the calf being immolated in the sight of
the lord
the priest that is anointed shall carry of the blood into the
tabernacle of the testimony
and shall dip his finger in it and sprinkle it seven times before
the veil
and he shall put of the same blood on the horns of the altar that
is before the lord in the tabernacle of the testimony and the rest of
the blood he shall pour at the foot of the altar of holocaust which is
at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony
and all the fat thereof he shall take off and shall burn it upon
the altar
doing so with this calf as he did also with that before and the
priest praying for them the lord will be merciful unto them
but the calf itself he shall carry forth without the camp and
shall burn it as he did the former calf because it is for the sin of
the multitude
if a prince shall sin and through ignorance do any one of the
things that the law of the lord forbiddeth
and afterwards shall come to know his sin he shall offer a buck
goat without blemish a sacrifice to the lord
and he shall put his hand upon the head thereof and when he hath
immolated it in the place where the holocaust is wont to be slain before
the lord because it is for sin
the priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the victim for
sin touching therewith the horns of the altar of holocaust and pouring
out the rest at the foot thereof
but the fat he shall burn upon it as is wont to be done with the
victims of peace offerings and the priest shall pray for him and for
his sin and it shall be forgiven him
and if any one of the people of the land shall sin through
ignorance doing any of those things that by the law of the lord are
forbidden and offending
and shall come to know his sin he shall offer a shegoat without
blemish
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim that is for
sin and shall immolate it in the place of the holocaust
and the priest shall take of the blood with his finger and shall
touch the horns of the altar of holocaust and shall pour out the rest
at the foot thereof
but taking off all the fat as is wont to be taken away of the
victims of peace offerings he shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet
savour to the lord and he shall pray for him and it shall be forgiven
him
but if he offer of the flock a victim for his sin to wit an ewe
without blemish
he shall put his hand upon the head thereof and shall immolate it
in the place where the victims of holocausts are wont to be slain
and the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger
and shall touch the horns of the altar of holocaust and the rest he
shall pour out at the foot thereof
all the fat also he shall take off as the fat of the ram that is
offered for peace offerings is wont to be taken away and shall burn it
upon the altar for a burnt sacrifice of the lord and he shall pray for
him and his sin and it shall be forgiven him
if any one sin and hear the voice of one swearing and is a
witness either because he himself hath seen or is privy to it if he do
not utter it he shall bear his iniquity
whosoever toucheth any unclean thing either that which hath been
killed by a beast or died of itself or any other creeping thing and
forgetteth his uncleanness he is guilty and hath offended
and if he touch any thing of the uncleanness of man according to
any uncleanness wherewith he is wont to be defiled and having forgotten
it come afterwards to know it he shall be guilty of an offence
the person that sweareth and uttereth with his lips that he would
do either evil or good and bindeth the same with an oath and his word
and having forgotten it afterwards understandeth his offence
let him do penance for his sin
and offer of the flocks an ewe lamb or a shegoat and the priest
shall pray for him and for his sin
but if he be not able to offer a beast let him offer two turtles
or two young pigeons to the lord one for sin and the other for a
holocaust
and he shall give them to the priest who shall offer the first for
sin and twist back the head of it to the little pinions so that it
stick to the neck and be not altogether broken off
and of its blood he shall sprinkle the side of the altar and
whatever is left he shall let it drop at the bottom thereof because it
is for sin
and the other he shall burn for a holocaust as is wont to be
done and the priest shall pray for him and for his sin and it shall
be forgiven him
and if his hand be not able to offer two turtles or two young
pigeons he shall offer for his sin the tenth part of an ephi of flour
it is for sin
and he shall deliver it to the priest who shall take a handful
thereof and shall burn it upon the altar for a memorial of him that
offered it
praying for him and making atonement but the part that is left
he himself shall have for a gift
and the lord spoke to moses saying
if any one shall sin through mistake transgressing the ceremonies
in those things that are sacrificed to the lord he shall offer for his
offence a ram without blemish out of the flocks that may be bought for
two sicles according to the weight of the sanctuary
and he shall make good the damage itself which he hath done and
shall add the fifth part besides delivering it to the priest who shall
pray for him offering the ram and it shall be forgiven him
if any one sin through ignorance and do one of those things which
by the law of the lord are forbidden and being guilty of sin
understand his iniquity
he shall offer of the flocks a ram without blemish to the priest
according to the measure and estimation of the sin and the priest shall
pray for him because he did it ignorantly and it shall be forgiven
him
because by mistake he trespassed against the lord
the perpetual fire the sacrifices of the priests and the sin
offerings
the lord spoke to moses saying
whosoever shall sin and despising the lord shall deny to his
neighbour the thing delivered to his keeping which was committed to his
trust or shall by force extort any thing or commit oppression
or shall find a thing lost and denying it shall also swear
falsely or shall do any other of the many things wherein men are wont
to sin
being convicted of the offence he shall restore
all that he would have gotten by fraud in the principal and the
fifth part besides to the owner whom he wronged
moreover for his sin he shall offer a ram without blemish out of
the flock and shall give it to the priest according to the estimation
and measure of the offence
and he shall pray for him before the lord and he shall have
forgiveness for every thing in doing of which he bath sinned
and the lord spoke to moses saying
command aaron and his sons this is the law of a holocaust it
shall be burnt upon the altar all night until morning the fire shall
be of the same altar
the priest shall be vested with the tunick and the linen breeches
and he shall take up the ashes of that which the devouring fire hath
burnt and putting them beside the altar
shall put off his former vestments and being clothed with others
shall carry them forth without the camp and shall cause them to be
consumed to dust in a very clean place
and the fire on the altar shall always burn and the priest shall
feed it putting wood on it every day in the morning and laying on the
holocaust shall burn thereupon the fat of the peace offerings
this is the perpetual fire which shall never go out on the altar
and was always kept burning on the altar as a figure of the heavenly
fire of divine love which ought to be always burning in the heart of a
this is the law of the sacrifice and libations which the children
of aaron shall offer before the lord and before the altar
the priest shall take a handful of the flour that is tempered with
oil and all the frankincense that is put upon the flour and he shall
burn on the altar for a memorial of most sweet odour to the lord
and the part of the flour that is left aaron and his sons shall
eat without leaven and he shall eat it in the holy place of the court
of the tabernacle
and therefore it shall not be leavened because part thereof is
offered for the burnt sacrifice of the lord it shall be most holy as
that which is offered for sin and for trespass
the males only of the race of aaron shall eat it it shall be an
ordinance everlasting in your generations concerning the sacrifices of
the lord every one that toucheth them shall be sanctified
and the lord spoke to moses saying
this is the oblation of aaron and of his sons which they must
offer to the lord in the day of their anointing they shall offer the
tenth part of an ephi of flour for a perpetual sacrifice half of it in
the morning and half of it in the evening
it shall be tempered with oil and shall be fried in a fryingpan
and the priest that rightfully succeedeth his father shall offer
it hot for a most sweet odour to the lord and it shall he wholly burnt
on the altar
for every sacrifice of the priest shall be consumed with fire
neither shall any man eat thereof
and the lord spoke to moses saying
say to aaron and his sons this is the law of the victim for sin
before the lord it is holy of holies
the priest that offereth it shall eat it in a holy place in the
court of the tabernacle
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be sanctified if
a garment be sprinkled with the blood thereof it shall be washed in a
holy place
and the earthen vessel wherein it was sodden shall be broken
but if the vessel be of brass it shall be scoured and washed with
water
every male of the priestly race shall eat of the flesh thereof
because it is holy of holies
for the victim that is slain for sin the blood of which is
carried into the tabernacle of the testimony to make atonement in the
sanctuary shall not be eaten but shall be burnt with fire
to be eaten
this also is the law of the sacrifice for a trespass it is most
holy
lesser offences than those for which the sin offerings were appointed
therefore where the holocaust is immolated the victim also for a
trespass shall be slain the blood thereof shall be poured round about
the altar
they shall offer thereof the rump and the fat that covereth the
entrails
the two little kidneys and the fat which is by the flanks and the
caul of the liver with the little kidneys
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar it is the burnt
sacrifice of the lord for a trespass
every male of the priestly race shall eat this flesh in a holy
place because it is most holy
as the sacrifice for sin is offered so is also that for a
trespass the same shall be the law of both these sacrifices it shall
belong to the priest that offereth it
the priest that offereth the victim of holocaust shall have the
skin thereof
and every sacrifice of flour that is baked in the oven and
whatsoever is dressed on the gridiron or in the fryingpan shall be the
priests that offereth it
whether they be tempered with oil or dry all the sons of aaron
shall have one as much as another
this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that is
offered to the lord
if the oblation be for thanksgiving they shall offer loaves
without leaven tempered with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with
oil and fine flour fried and cakes tempered and mingled with oil
moreover loaves of leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanks
which is offered for peace offerings
of which one shall be offered to the lord for firstfruits and
shall be the priests that shall pour out the blood of the victim
and the flesh of it shall be eaten the same day neither shall any
of it remain until the morning
if any man by vow or of his own accord offer a sacrifice it
shall in like manner be eaten the same day and if any of it remain
until the morrow it is lawful to eat it
but whatsoever shall be found on the third day shall be consumed
with fire
if any man eat of the flesh of the victim of peace offerings on
the third day the oblation shall be of no effect neither shall it
profit the offerer yea rather whatsoever soul shall defile itself with
such meat shall be guilty of transgression
the flesh that hath touched any unclean thing shall not be eaten
but shall be burnt with fire he that is clean shall eat of it
if any one that is defiled shall eat of the flesh of the sacrifice
of peace offerings which is offered to the lord he shall be cut off
from his people
and he that hath touched the uncleanness of man or of beast or
of any thing that can defile and shall eat of such kind of flesh shall
be cut off from his people
and the lord spoke to moses saying
say to the children of israel the fat of a sheep and of an ox
and of a goat you shall not eat
the fat of a carcass that hath died of itself and of a beast that
was caught by another beast you shall have for divers uses
if any man eat the fat that should be offered for the burnt
sacrifice of the lord he shall perish out of his people
moreover you shall not eat the blood of any creature whatsoever
whether of birds or beasts
every one that eateth blood shall perish from among the people
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel saying he that offereth a victim
of peace offerings to the lord let him offer therewith a sacrifice
also that is the libations thereof
he shall hold in his hands the fat of the victim and the breast
deliver them to the priest
who shall burn the fat upon the altar but the breast shall be
the right shoulder also of the victim of peace offerings shall
fall to the priest for firstfruits
he among the sons of aaron that offereth the blood and the fat
he shall have the right shoulder also for his portion
for the breast that is elevated and the shoulder that is separated
offerings and have given them to aaron the priest and to his sons by
a law for ever from all the people of israel
this is the anointing of aaron and his sons in the ceremonies of
the lord in the day when moses offered them that they might do the
office of priesthood
and the things that the lord commanded to be given them by the
children of israel by a perpetual observance in their generations
this is the law of holocaust and of the sacrifice for sin and
for trespass and for consecration and the victims of peace offerings
which the lord appointed to moses in mount sinai when he
commanded the children of israel that they should offer their oblations
to the lord in the desert of sinai
and the lord spoke to moses saying
take aaron with his sons their vestments and the oil of unction
a calf for sin two rams a basket with unleavened bread
and thou shalt gather together all the congregation to the door of
the tabernacle
and moses did as the lord had commanded and all the multitude
being gathered together before the door of the tabernacle
he said this is the word that the lord hath commanded to be done
and immediately he offered aaron and his sons and when he had
washed them
he vested the high priest with the strait linen garment girding
him with the girdle and putting on him the violet tunick and over it
he put the ephod
and binding it with the girdle he fitted it to the rational on
which was doctrine and truth
he put also the mitre upon his head and upon the mitre over the
forehead he put the plate of gold consecrated with sanctification as
the lord had commanded him
he took also the oil of unction with which he anointed the
tabernacle with all the furniture thereof
and when he had sanctified and sprinkled the altar seven times he
anointed it and all the vessels thereof and the laver with the foot
thereof he sanctified with the oil
and he poured it upon aarons head and he anointed and
consecrated him
and after he had offered his sons he vested them with linen
tunicks and girded them with girdles and put mitres on them as the
he offered also the calf for sin and when aaron and his sons had
put their hands upon the head thereof
he immolated it and took the blood and dipping his finger in it
he touched the horns of the altar round about which being expiated and
sanctified he poured the rest of the blood at the bottom thereof
but the fat that was upon the entrails and the caul of the liver
and the two little kidneys with their fat he burnt upon the altar
and the calf with the skin and the flesh and the dung he burnt
without the camp as the lord had commanded
he offered also a ram for holocaust and when aaron and his sons
had put their hands upon its head
he immolated it and poured the blood thereof round about the
altar
and cutting the ram into pieces the head thereof and the joints
and the fat he burnt in the fire
having first washed the entrails and the feet and the whole ram
together he burnt upon the altar because it was a holocaust of most
sweet odour to the lord as he had commanded him
he offered also the second ram in the consecration of priests
and aaron and his sons put their hands upon the head thereof
and when moses had immolated it he took of the blood thereof and
touched the tip of aarons right ear and the thumb of his right hand
and in like manner also the great toe of his right foot
he offered also the sons of aaron and when with the blood of the
ram that was immolated he had touched the tip of the right ear of every
one of them and the thumbs of their right hands and the great toes of
their right feet the rest he poured on the altar round about
but the fat and the rump and all the fat that covereth the
entrails and the caul of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat
and with the right shoulder he separated
and taking out of the basket of unleavened bread which was before
the lord a loaf without leaven and a cake tempered with oil and a
wafer he put them upon the fat and the right shoulder
delivering all to aaron and to his sons who having lifted them
up before the lord
he took them again from their hands and burnt them upon the altar
of holocaust because it was the oblation of consecration for a sweet
odour of sacrifice to the lord
and he took of the ram of consecration the breast for his
portion elevating it before the lord as the lord had commanded him
and taking the ointment and the blood that was upon the altar he
sprinkled aaron and his vestments and his sons and their vestments
with it
and when he had sanctified them in their vestments he commanded
them saying boil the flesh before the door of the tabernacle and
there eat it eat ye also the loaves of consecration that are laid in
the basket as the lord commanded me saying aaron and his sons shall
eat them
and whatsoever shall be left of the flesh and the loaves shall be
consumed with fire
and you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle for seven
days until the day wherein the time of your consecration shall be
expired for in seven days the consecration is finished
as at this present it hath been done that the rite of the
sacrifice might be accomplished
day and night shall you remain in the tabernacle observing the
watches of the lord lest you die for so it hath been commanded me
and aaron and his sons did all things which the lord spoke by the
hand of moses
the lord upon the altar
and when the eighth day was come moses called aaron and his sons
and the ancients of israel and said to aaron
take of the herd a calf for sin and a ram for a holocaust both
without blemish and offer them before the lord
and to the children of israel thou shalt say take ye a hegoat for
sin and a calf and a lamb both of a year old and without blemish for
a holocaust
also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings and immolate them
before the lord offering for the sacrifice of every one of them flour
tempered with oil for to day the lord will appear to you
they brought therefore all things that moses had commanded before
the door of the tabernacle where when all the multitude stood
moses said this is the word which the lord hath commanded do it
and his glory will appear to you
and he said to aaron approach to the altar and offer sacrifice
for thy sin offer the holocaust and pray for thyself and for the
people and when thou hast slain the peoples victim pray for them as
the lord hath commanded
and forthwith aaron approaching to the altar immolated the calf
for his sin
and his sons brought him the blood of it and he dipped his finger
therein and touched the horns of the altar and poured the rest at the
foot thereof
and the fat and the little kidneys and the caul of the liver
which are for sin he burnt upon the altar as the lord had commanded
but the flesh and skins thereof he burnt with fire without the
camp
he immolated also the victim of holocaust and his sons brought
him the blood thereof which he poured round about on the altar
and the victim being cut into pieces they brought to him the head
and all the members all which he burnt with fire upon the altar
having first washed the entrails and the feet with water
then offering for the sin of the people he slew the hegoat and
expiating the altar
he offered the holocaust
adding in the sacrifice the libations which are offered withal
and burning them upon the altar besides the ceremonies of the morning
holocaust
he immolated also the bullock and the ram and peace offerings of
the people and his sons brought him the blood which he poured upon the
altar round about
the fat also of the bullock and the rump of the ram and the two
little kidneys with their fat and the caul of the liver
they put upon the breasts and after the fat was burnt upon the
altar
aaron separated their breasts and the right shoulders elevating
them before the lord as moses had commanded
and stretching forth his hands to the people he blessed them and
so the victims for sin and the holocausts and the peace offerings
being finished he came down
and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony and
afterwards came forth and blessed the people and the glory of the lord
appeared to all the multitude
and behold a fire coming forth from the lord devoured the
holocaust and the fat that was upon the altar which when the multitude
saw they praised the lord falling on their faces
forbidden to drink wine when they enter into the tabernacle the law of
eating the holy things
and nadab and abiu the sons of aaron taking their censers put
fire therein and incense on it offering before the lord strange fire
which was not commanded them
and fire coming out from the lord destroyed them and they died
before the lord
and moses said to aaron this is what the lord hath spoken i will
be sanctified in them that approach to me and i will be glorified in
the sight of all the people and when aaron heard this he held his
peace
and moses called misael and elisaphan the sons of oziel the
uncle of aaron and said to them go and take away your brethren from
before the sanctuary and carry them without the camp
and they went forthwith and took them as they lay vested with
linen tunicks and cast them forth as had been commanded them
and moses said to aaron and to eleazar and ithamar his sons
die and indignation come upon all the congregation let your brethren
and all the house of israel bewail the burning which the lord has
kindled
but you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle otherwise
you shall perish for the oil of the holy unction is on you and they
did all things according to the precept of moses
the lord also said to aaron
you shall not drink wine nor any thing that may make drunk thou
nor thy sons when you enter into the tabernacle of the testimony lest
you die because it is an everlasting precept through your generations
and that you may have knowledge to discern between holy and
unholy between unclean and clean
and may teach the children of israel all my ordinances which the
and moses spoke to aaron and to eleazar and ithamar his sons
that were left take the sacrifice that is remaining of the oblation of
the lord and eat it without leaven beside the altar because it is holy
of holies
and you shall eat it in a holy place which is given to thee and
thy sons of the oblations of the lord as it hath been commanded me
the breast also that is offered and the shoulder that is
separated you shall eat in a most clean place thou and thy sons and
thy daughters with thee for they are set aside for thee and thy
children of the victims of peace offerings of the children of israel
because they have elevated before the lord the shoulder and the
breast and the fat that is burnt on the altar and they belong to thee
and to thy sons by a perpetual law as the lord hath commanded
while these things were a doing when moses sought for the buck
goat that had been offered for sin he found it burnt and being angry
with eleazar and ithamar the sons of aaron that were left he said
why did you not eat in the holy place the sacrifice for sin
which is most holy and given to you that you may bear the iniquity of
the people and may pray for them in the sight of the lord
especially whereas none of the blood thereof hath been carried
within the holy places and you ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary
as was commanded me
aaron answered this day hath been offered the victim for sin
and the holocaust before the lord and to me what thou seest has
happened how could i eat it or please the lord in the ceremonies
having a sorrowful heart
which when moses had heard he was satisfied
and the lord spoke to moses and aaron saying
say to the children of israel these are the animals which you are
to eat of all the living things of the earth
beasts birds and fishes in the law was ordered st to exercise the
people in obedience and temperance ndly to restrain them from the
vices of which these animals were symbols rdly because the things
here forbidden were for the most part unwholesome and not proper to be
eaten thly that the people of god by being obliged to abstain from
things corporally unclean might be trained up to seek a spiritual
cleanness
whatsoever hath the hoof divided and cheweth the cud among the
beasts you shall eat
chewing of the cud signify discretion between good and evil and
meditating on the law of god and where either of these is wanting a man
is unclean in like manner fishes were reputed unclean that had not fins
and scales that is souls that did not raise themselves up by prayer
and cover themselves with the scales of virtue
but whatsoever cheweth indeed the cud and hath a hoof but
divideth it not as the camel and others that you shall not eat but
shall reckon it among the unclean
the cherogrillus which cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof
is unclean
hedgehog st jerome intimates that it is another kind of animal common
in palestine which lives in the holes of rocks or in the earth we
choose here as also in the names of several other creatures that follow
which are little known in this part of the world to keep the greek or
the hare also for that too cheweth the cud but divideth not the
hoof
and the swine which though it divideth the hoof cheweth not the
cud
the flesh of these you shall not eat nor shall you touch their
carcasses because they are unclean to you
these are the things that breed in the waters and which it is
lawful to eat all that hath fins and scales as well in the sea as in
the rivers and the pools you shall eat

and all that is of the raven kind according to their likeness
the ostrich and the owl and the larus and the hawk according
to its kind

and the swan and the bittern and the porphyrion
the heron and the charadroin according to its kind the houp

of things that fly whatsoever goeth upon four feet shall be
abominable to you
but whatsoever walketh upon four feet but hath the legs behind
longer wherewith it hoppeth upon the earth

ophimachus and the locust every one according to their kind
but of flying things whatsoever hath four feet only shall be an
abomination to you
and whosoever shall touch the carcasses of them shall be
defiled and shall be unclean until the evening
and if it be necessary that he carry any of these things when
they are dead he shall wash his clothes and shall be unclean until the
sun set
every beast that hath a hoof but divideth it not nor cheweth
the cud shall be unclean and he that toucheth it shall be defiled
that which walketh upon hands of all animals which go on all
four shall be unclean he that shall touch their carcasses shall be
defiled until evening
and he that shall carry such carcasses shall wash his clothes
and shall be unclean until evening because all these things are unclean
to you
these also shall be reckoned among unclean things of all that
move upon the earth the weasel and the mouse and the crocodile every
one according to their kind
the shrew and the chameleon and the stellio and the lizard
and the mole
all these are unclean he that toucheth their carcasses shall be
unclean until the evening
and upon what thing soever any of their carcasses shall fall it
shall be defiled whether it be a vessel of wood or a garment or skins
or haircloths or any thing in which work is done they shall be dipped
in water and shall be unclean until the evening and so afterwards
shall be clean
but an earthen vessel into which any of these shall fall shall
be defiled and therefore is to be broken
any meat which you eat if water from such a vessel be poured
upon it shall be unclean and every liquor that is drunk out of any
such vessel shall be unclean
and upon whatsoever thing any of these dead beasts shall fall it
shall be unclean whether it be oven or pots with feet they shall be
destroyed and shall be unclean
but fountains and cisterns and all gatherings together of waters
shall be clean he that toucheth their carcasses shall be defiled
if it fall upon seed corn it shall not defile it

or traileth on the earth you shall not eat because it is abominable
do not defile your souls nor touch aught thereof lest you be
unclean
for i am the lord your god be holy because i am holy defile
not your souls by any creeping thing that moveth upon the earth
for i am the lord who brought you out of the land of egypt that
you shall be holy because i am holy this is the law of beasts
and fowls and of every living creature that moveth in the waters and
creepeth on the earth
that you may know the differences of the clean and unclean and
know what you ought to eat and what to refuse
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say to them if a
woman having received seed shall bear a man child she shall be unclean
seven days according to the days of separation of her flowers
and on the eighth day the infant shall be circumcised
but she shall remain three and thirty days in the blood of her
purification she shall touch no holy thing neither shall she enter
into the sanctuary until the days of her purification be fulfilled
but if she shall bear a maid child she shall be unclean two
weeks according to the custom of her monthly courses and she shall
remain in the blood of her purification sixtysix days
and when the days of her purification are expired for a son or
for a daughter she shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the
testimony a lamb of a year old for a holocaust and a young pigeon or a
turtle for sin and shall deliver them to the priest
who shall offer them before the lord and shall pray for her and
so she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood this is the law
for her that beareth a man child or a maid child
and if her hand find not sufficiency and she is not able to offer
a lamb she shall take two turtles or two young pigeons one for a
holocaust and another for sin and the priest shall pray for her and
so she shall be cleansed
and the lord spoke to moses and aaron saying
the man in whose skin or flesh shall arise a different colour or a
blister or as it were something shining that is the stroke of the
leprosy shall be brought to aaron the priest or any or of his sons
and if he see the leprosy in his skin and the hair turned white
and the place where the leprosy appears lower than the skin and the rest
of the flesh it is the stroke of the leprosy and upon his judgment he
shall be separated
but if there be a shining whiteness in the skin and not lower
than the other flesh and the hair be of the former colour the priest
shall shut him up seven days
and the seventh day he shall look on him and if the leprosy be
grown no farther and hath not spread itself in the skin he shall shut
him up again other seven days
and on the seventh day he shall look on him if the leprosy be
somewhat obscure and not spread in the skin he shall declare him
clean because it is but a scab and the man shall wash his clothes and
shall be clean
but if the leprosy grow again after he was seen by the priest
and restored to cleanness he shall be brought to him
and shall be condemned of uncleanness
if the stroke of the leprosy be in a man he shall be brought to
the priest
and he shall view him and when there shall be a white colour in
the skin and it shall have changed the look of the hair and the living
flesh itself shall appear
it shall be judged an inveterate leprosy and grown into the
skin the priest therefore shall declare him unclean and shall not shut
him up because he is evidently unclean
but if the leprosy spring out running about in the skin and
cover all the skin from the head to the feet whatsoever falleth under
the sight of the eyes
the priest shall view him and shall judge that the leprosy which
he has is very clean because it is all turned into whiteness and
therefore the man shall be clean
but when the live flesh shall appear in him
then by the judgment of the priest he shall be defiled and shall
be reckoned among the unclean for live flesh if it be spotted with
leprosy is unclean
and if again it be turned into whiteness and cover all the man
the priest shall view him and shall judge him to be clean
when also there has been an ulcer in the flesh and the skin and
it has been healed
and in the place of the ulcer there appeareth a white scar or
somewhat red the man shall be brought to the priest
and when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the
other flesh and the hair turned white he shall declare him unclean
for the plague of leprosy is broken out in the ulcer
but if the hair be of the former colour and the scar somewhat
obscure and be not lower than the flesh that is near it he shall shut
him up seven days
and if it spread he shall judge him to have the leprosy
but if it stay in its place it is but the scar of an ulcer and
the man shall be clean
the flesh also and skin that hath been burnt and after it is
healed hath a white or a red scar
the priest shall view it and if he see it turned white and the
place thereof is lower than the other skin he shall declare him
unclean because the evil of leprosy is broken out in the scar
but if the colour of the hair be not changed nor the blemish
lower than the other flesh and the appearance of the leprosy be
somewhat obscure he shall shut him up seven days
and on the seventh day he shall view him if the leprosy be grown
farther in the skin he shall declare him unclean
but if the whiteness stay in its place and be not very clear it
is the sore of a burning and therefore he shall be cleansed because it
is only the scar of a burning
if the leprosy break out in the head or the beard of a man or
woman the priest shall see them
and if the place be lower than the other flesh and the hair
yellow and thinner than usual he shall declare them unclean because
it is the leprosy of the head and the beard
but if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with the flesh
that is near it and the hair black he shall shut him up seven days
and on the seventh day he shall look upon it if the spot be not
grown and the hair keep its colour and the place of the blemish be
even with the other flesh
the man shall be shaven all but the place of the spot and he
shall be shut up other seven days
if on the seventh day the evil seem to have stayed in its place
and not lower than the other flesh he shall cleanse him and his
clothes being washed he shall be clean
but if after his cleansing the spot spread again in the skin
he shall seek no more whether the hair be turned yellow because
he is evidently unclean
but if the spot be stayed and the hair be black let him know
that the man is healed and let him confidently pronounce him clean
if a whiteness appear in the skin of a man or a woman
the priest shall view them if he find that a darkish whiteness
shineth in the skin let him know that it is not the leprosy but a
white blemish and that the man is clean
the man whose hair falleth off from his head he is bald and
clean
and if the hair fall from his forehead he is bald before and
clean
but if in the bald head or in the bald forehead there be risen a
white or reddish colour
and the priest perceive this he shall condemn him undoubtedly of
leprosy which is risen in the bald part
now whosoever shall be defiled with the leprosy and is separated
by the judgment of the priest
shall have his clothes hanging loose his head bare his mouth
covered with a cloth and he shall cry out that he is defiled and
unclean
all the time that he is a leper and unclean he shall dwell alone
without the camp
a woollen or linen garment that shall have the leprosy
in the warp and the woof or skin or whatsoever is made of a
skin
if it be infected with a white or red spot it shall be accounted
the leprosy and shall be shewn to the priest
and he shall look upon it and shall shut it up seven days
and on the seventh day when he looketh on it again if he find
that it is grown it is a fixed leprosy he shall judge the garment
unclean and every thing wherein it shall be found
and therefore it shall be burnt with fire
but if he see that it is not grown
he shall give orders and they shall wash that part wherein the
leprosy is and he shall shut it up other seven days
and when he shall see that the former colour is not returned nor
yet the leprosy spread he shall judge it unclean and shall burn it
with fire for the leprosy has taken hold of the outside of the garment
or through the whole
but if the place of the leprosy be somewhat dark after the
garment is washed he shall tear it off and divide it from that which
is sound
and if after this there appear in those places that before were
without spot a flying and wandering leprosy it must be burnt with
fire
if it cease he shall wash with water the parts that are pure
the second time and they shall be clean
this is the law touching the leprosy of any woollen or linen
garment either in the warp or woof or any thing of skins how it ought
to be cleaned or pronounced unclean
and the lord spoke to moses saying
this is the rite of a leper when he is to be cleansed he shall
be brought to the priest
who going out of the camp when he shall find that the leprosy is
cleansed
shall command him that is to be purified to offer for himself two
living sparrows which it is lawful to eat and cedar wood and scarlet
and hyssop
and he shall command one of the sparrows to be immolated in an
earthen vessel over living waters
but the other that is alive he shall dip with the cedar wood
and the scarlet and the hyssop in the blood of the sparrow that is
immolated
wherewith he shall sprinkle him that is to be cleansed seven
times that he may be rightly purified and he shall let go the living
sparrow that it may fly into the field
and when the man hath washed his clothes he shall shave all the
hair of his body and shall be washed with water and being purified he
shall enter into the camp yet so that he tarry without his own tent
seven days
and on the seventh day he shall shave the hair of his head and
his beard and his eyebrows and the hair of all his body and having
washed again his clothes and his body
on the eighth day he shall take two lambs without blemish and
an ewe of a year old without blemish and three tenths of flour tempered
with oil for a sacrifice and a sextary of oil apart
of a hin and held about as much as six eggs
and when the priest that purifieth the man hath presented him
and all these things before the lord at the door of the tabernacle of
the testimony
he shall take a lamb and offer it for a trespass offering with
the sextary of oil and having offered all before the lord
he shall immolate the lamb where the victim for sin is wont to
be immolated and the holocaust that is in the holy place for as that
which is for sin so also the victim for a trespass offering pertaineth
to the priest it is holy of holies
and the priest taking of the blood of the victim that was
immolated for trespass shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of
him that is cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand and the great
toe of his right foot
leper were mysterious and very significative the sprinkling seven
times with the blood of the little bird the washing himself and his
clothes the shaving his hair and his beard signify the means which are
to be used in the reconciliation of a sinner and the steps by which he
is to return to god viz by the repeated application of the blood of
retrenching all vanities and superfluities by employing all that is
over and above what is necessary in alms deeds the sin offering and
the holocaust or burnt offering which he was to offer at his cleansing
signify the sacrifice of a contrite and humble heart and that of
adoration in spirit and truth with gratitude and thankfulness for the
forgiveness of sins with which we are ever to appear before the
the great toe of the right foot first with the blood of the victim and
then with the remainder of the oil which had been sprinkled seven times
before the lord signify the application of the blood of christ and the
unction of the sevenfold grace of the holy ghost to the sinners right
ear that he may duly hearken to and obey the law of god and to his
right hand and foot that the works of his hands and all the steps or
affections of his soul signified by the feet may be rightly directed
to god
and he shall pour of the sextary of oil into his own left hand
and shall dip his right finger in it and sprinkle it before the
and the rest of the oil in his left hand he shall pour upon the
tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed and upon the thumb of his
right hand and the great toe of his right foot and upon the blood that
was shed for trespass
and upon his head
and he shall pray for him before the lord and shall offer the
sacrifice for sin then shall he immolate the holocaust
and put it on the altar with the libations thereof and the man
shall be rightly cleansed
but if he be poor and his hand cannot find the things aforesaid
he shall take a lamb for an offering for trespass that the priest may
pray for him and a tenth part of flour tempered with oil for a
sacrifice and a sextary of oil
and two turtles or two young pigeons of which one may be for
sin and the other for a holocaust
and he shall offer them on the eighth day of his purification to
the priest at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the
and the priest receiving the lamb for trespass and the sextary
of oil shall elevate them together
and the lamb being immolated he shall put of the blood thereof
upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed and upon the
thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot
but he shall pour part of the oil into his own left hand
and dipping the finger of his right hand in it he shall sprinkle
it seven times before the lord
and he shall touch the tip of the right ear of him that is
cleansed and the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right
foot in the place of the blood that was shed for trespass
and the other part of the oil that is in his left hand he shall
pour upon the head of the purified person that he may appease the lord
for him
and he shall offer a turtle or young pigeon
one for trespass and the other for a holocaust with their
libations
this is the sacrifice of a leper that is not able to have all
things that appertain to his cleansing
and the lord spoke to moses and aaron saying
when you shall come into the land of chanaan which i will give
you for a possession if there be the plague or leprosy in a house
he whose house it is shall go and tell the priest saying it
seemeth to me that there is the plague of leprosy in my house
and he shall command that they carry forth all things out of the
house before he go into it and see whether it have the leprosy let
all things become unclean that are in the house and afterwards he shall
go in to view the leprosy of the house
and if he see in the walls thereof as it were little dints
disfigured with paleness or redness and lower than all he rest
he shall go out of the door of the house and forthwith shut it
up seven days
and returning on the seventh day he shall look upon it if he
find that the leprosy is spread
he shall command that the stones wherein the leprosy is be
taken out and cast without the city into an unclean place
and that the house be scraped on the inside round about and the
dust of the scrapings be scattered without the city into an unclean
place
and that other stones be laid in the place of them that were
taken away and the house be plastered with other mortar
but if after the stones be taken out and the dust scraped off
and it be plastered with other earth
the priest going in perceive that the leprosy is returned and
the walls full of spots it is a lasting leprosy and the house is
unclean
and they shall destroy it forthwith and shall cast the stones
and timber thereof and all the dust without the town into an unclean
place
he that entereth into the house when it is shut shall be unclean
until evening
and he that sleepeth in it and eateth any thing shall wash his
clothes
but if the priest going in perceive that the leprosy is not
spread in the house after it was plastered again he shall purify it
it being cured
and for the purification thereof he shall take two sparrows and
cedar wood and scarlet and hyssop
and having immolated one sparrow in an earthen vessel over
living waters
he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet
and the living sparrow and shall dip all in the blood of the sparrow
that is immolated and in the living water and he shall sprinkle the
house seven times
and shall purify it as well with the blood of the sparrow as
with the living water and with the living sparrow and with the cedar
wood and the hyssop and the scarlet
and when he hath let go the sparrow to fly freely away into the
field he shall pray for the house and it shall be rightly cleansed
this is the law of every kind of leprosy and stroke
of the leprosy of garments and houses
of a scar and of blisters breaking out of a shining spot and
when the colours are diversely changed
that it may be known when a thing is clean or unclean
and the lord spoke to moses and aaron saying
speak to the children of israel and say to them the man that
hath an issue of seed shall be unclean
instituted in order to give the people a horror of carnal impurities
and then shall he be judged subject to this evil when a filthy

if he who suffereth this disease be healed he shall number seven
days after his cleansing and having washed his clothes and all his
body in living water he shall be clean
and on the eighth day he shall take two turtles or two young
pigeons and he shall come before the lord to the door of the
tabernacle of the testimony and shall give them to the priest

two turtles or two young pigeons at the door of the tabernacle of the
testimony

and he shall pray for her before the lord and for the issue of her
uncleanness
you shall teach therefore the children of israel to take heed of
uncleanness that they may not die in their filth when they shall have
defiled my tabernacle that is among them
this is the law of him that hath the issue of seed and that is
defiled by copulation

and he commanded him saying speak to aaron thy brother that he
enter not at all into the sanctuary which is within the veil before the

door of the tabernacle of the testimony
and casting lots upon them both one to be offered to the lord
and the other to be the emissary goat
that whose lot fell to be offered to the lord he shall offer for
sin
but that whose lot was to be the emissary goat he shall present
before the lord that he may pour prayers upon him and let him go into
the wilderness

and praying for himself and for his own house he shall immolate it
and taking the censer which he hath filled with the burning
coals of the altar and taking up with his hands the compounded perfume
for incense he shall go in within the veil into the holy place
that when the perfumes are put upon the fire the cloud and
vapour thereof may cover the oracle which is over the testimony and he
may not die
he shall take also of the blood of the calf and sprinkle with
his finger seven times towards the propitiatory to the east
and when he hath killed the buck goat for the sin of the people
he shall carry in the blood thereof within the veil as he was commanded
to do with the blood of the calf that he may sprinkle it over against
the oracle
and may expiate the sanctuary from the uncleanness of the
children of israel and from their transgressions and all their sins
which is fixed among them in the midst of the filth of their habitation
let no man be in the tabernacle when the high priest goeth into
the sanctuary to pray for himself and his house and for the whole
congregation of israel until he come out
and when he is come out to the altar that is before the lord let
him pray for himself and taking the blood of the calf and of the buck
goat let him pour it upon the horns thereof round about
and sprinkling with his finger seven times let him expiate and
sanctify it from the uncleanness of the children of israel
after he hath cleaned the sanctuary and the tabernacle and the
altar then let him offer the living goat
and putting both hands upon his head let him confess all the

and when the goat hath carried all their iniquities into an
uninhabited land and shall be let go into the desert
aaron shall return into the tabernacle of the testimony and
putting off the vestments which he had on him before when he entered
into the sanctuary and leaving them there
he shall wash his flesh in the holy place and shall put on his
own garments and after that he is come out and hath offered his own
holocaust and that of the people he shall pray both for himself and
for the people
and the fat that is offered for sins he shall burn on the altar
but he that hath let go the emissary goat shall wash his
clothes and his body with water and so shall enter into the camp
but the calf and the buck goat that were sacrificed for sin and
whose blood was carried into the sanctuary to accomplish the atonement
they shall carry forth without the camp and shall burn with fire their
skins and their flesh and their dung
and whosoever burneth them shall wash his clothes and flesh with
water and so shall enter into the camp
and this shall be to you an everlasting ordinance the seventh
month the tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls and
shall do no work whether it be one of your own country or a stranger
that sojourneth among you
upon this day shall be the expiation for you and the cleansing
from all your sins you shall be cleansed before the lord
for it is a sabbath of rest and you shall afflict your souls by
a perpetual religion
and the priest that is anointed and whose hands are consecrated
to do the office of the priesthood in his fathers stead shall make
atonement and he shall be vested with the linen robe and the holy
vestments
and he shall expiate the sanctuary and the tabernacle of the
testimony and the altar the priest also and all the people
and this shall be an ordinance for ever that you pray for the
children of israel and for all their sins once a year he did therefore
as the lord had commanded moses
prohibition of blood
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to aaron and his sons and to all the children of israel
saying to them this is the word which the lord hath commanded saying
any man whosoever of the house of israel if he kill an ox or a
sheep or a goat in the camp or without the camp
forbids sacrifices to be offered in any other place but at the
tabernacle or temple of the lord to signify that no sacrifice would be
acceptable to god out of his true temple the one holy catholic
apostolic church
and offer it not at the door of the tabernacle an oblation to the
perish from the midst of his people
therefore the children of israel shall bring to the priest their
victims which they kill in the field that they may be sanctified to
the lord before the door of the tabernacle of the testimony and they
may sacrifice them for peace offerings to the lord
and the priest shall pour the blood upon the altar of the lord at
the door of the tabernacle of the testimony and shall burn the fat for
a sweet odour to the lord
and they shall no more sacrifice their victims to devils with
whom they have committed fornication it shall be an ordinance for ever
to them and to their posterity
and thou shalt say to them the man of the house of israel and of
the strangers who sojourn among you that offereth a holocaust or a
victim
and bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the
testimony that it may be offered to the lord shall perish from among
his people
if any man whosoever of the house of israel and of the strangers
that sojourn among them eat blood i will set my face against his soul
and will cut him off from among his people
reserved it to himself to be offered in sacrifices on the altar as to
the lord of life and death and as a figure of the blood of christ and
partly to give men a horror of shedding blood gen
because the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given
it to you that you may make atonement with it upon the altar for your
souls and the blood may be for an expiation of the soul
therefore i have said to the children of israel no soul of you
nor of the strangers that sojourn among you shall eat blood
any man whosoever of the children of israel and of the strangers
that sojourn among you if by hunting or fowling he take a wild beast
or a bird which is lawful to eat let him pour out its blood and cover
it with earth
for the life of all flesh is in the blood therefore i said to
the children of israel you shall not eat the blood of any flesh at all
because the life of the flesh is in the blood and whosoever eateth it
shall be cut off
the soul that eateth that which died of itself or has been
caught by a beast whether he be one of your own country or a stranger
shall wash his clothes and himself with water and shall be defiled
until the evening and in this manner he shall be made clean
but if he do not wash his clothes and his body he shall bear
his iniquity
lusts

so from the fifteenth day of the seventh month when you shall
have gathered in all the fruits of your land you shall celebrate the
feast of the lord seven days on the first day and the eighth shall be a
sabbath that is a day of rest
and you shall take to you on the first day the fruits of the
fairest tree and branches of palm trees and boughs of thick trees and
willows of the brook and you shall rejoice before the lord your god
and you shall keep the solemnity thereof seven days in the year
month shall you celebrate this feast
and you shall dwell in bowers seven days every one that is of
the race of israel shall dwell in tabernacles
that your posterity may know that i made the children of israel
to dwell in tabernacles when i brought them out of the land of egypt i
am the lord your god
and moses spoke concerning the feasts of the lord to the children
of israel
blasphemy
and the lord spoke to moses saying
command the children of israel that they bring unto thee the
finest and clearest oil of olives to furnish the lamps continually
without the veil of the testimony in the tabernacle of the
covenant and aaron shall set them from evening until morning before the
they shall be set upon the most pure candlestick before the lord
continually
thou shalt take also fine flour and shalt bake twelve loaves
thereof two tenths shall be in every loaf
and thou shalt set them six and six one against another upon the
most clean table before the lord
and thou shalt put upon them the clearest frankincense that the
bread may be for a memorial of the oblation of the lord
every sabbath they shall be changed before the lord being
received of the children of israel by an everlasting covenant
and they shall be aarons and his sons that they may eat them in
the holy place because it is most holy of the sacrifices of the lord by
a perpetual right
and behold there went out the son of a woman of israel whom she
had of an egyptian among the children of israel and fell at words in
the camp with a man of israel
and when he had blasphemed the name and had cursed it he was
brought to moses now his mother was called salumith the daughter of
and they put him into prison till they might know what the lord
would command
and the lord spoke to moses
saying bring forth the blasphemer without the camp and let them
that heard him put their hands upon his head and let all the people
stone him
and thou shalt speak to the children of israel the man that
curseth his god shall bear his sin
and he that blasphemeth the name of the lord dying let him die
he that striketh and killeth a man dying let him die
he that killeth a beast shall make it good that is to say shall
give beast for beast
he that giveth a blemish to any of his neighbours as he hath
done so shall it be done to him
breach for breach eye for ere tooth for tooth shall he
restore what blemish he gave the like shall he be compelled to suffer
he that striketh a beast shall render another he that striketh
a man shall be punished
let there be equal judgment among you whether he be a stranger
or a native that offends because i am the lord your god
and moses spoke to the children of israel and they brought forth
him that had blasphemed without the camp and they stoned him and the
children of israel did as the lord had commanded moses
and the lord spoke to moses in mount sinai saying
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say to them when
you shall have entered into the land which i will give you observe the
rest of the sabbath of the lord
six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune
thy vineyard and shalt gather the fruits thereof
but in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath to the land of
the resting of the lord thou shalt not sow thy field nor prune thy
vineyard
what the ground shall bring forth of itself thou shalt not reap
neither shalt thou gather the grapes or the firstfruits as a vintage
but they shall be unto you for meat to thee and to thy
manservant to thy maidservant and thy hireling and to the strangers
that sojourn with thee
all things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to thy
cattle
thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years that is to
say seven times seven which together make fortynine years
and thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month the tenth
day of the month in the time of the expiation in all your land
and thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year and shalt proclaim
remission to all the inhabitants of thy land for it is the year of
jubilee every man shall return to his possession and every one shall
go back to his former family
bondage and a reinstating of every man in his former possessions
because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year you shall not
sow nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord
neither shall you gather the firstfruits of the vines
because of the sanctification of the jubilee but as they grow
you shall presently eat them
in the year of the jubilee all shall return to their possessions
when thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour or shalt buy of
him grieve not thy brother but thou shalt buy of him according to the
number of years from the jubilee
and he shall sell to thee according to the computation of the
fruits
the more years remain after the jubilee the more shall the price
increase and the less time is counted so much the less shall the
purchase cost for he shall sell to thee the time of the fruits
do not afflict your countrymen but let every one fear his god
do my precepts and keep my judgments and fulfil them that you
may dwell in the land without any fear
and the ground may yield you its fruits of which you may eat
your fill fearing no mans invasion
but if you say what shall we eat the seventh year if we sow
not nor gather our fruits
i will give you my blessing the sixth year and it shall yield
the fruits of three years
and the eighth year you shall sow and shall eat of the old
fruits until the ninth year till new grow up you shall eat the old
store
the land also shall not be sold for ever because it is mine and
you are strangers and sojourners with me
for which cause all the country of your possession shall be under
the condition of redemption
if thy brother being impoverished sell his little possession and
his kinsman will he may redeem what he had sold
but if he have no kinsman and he himself can find the price to
redeem it
the value of the fruits shall be counted from that time when he
sold it and the overplus he shall restore to the buyer and so shall
receive his possession again
but if his hands find not the means to repay the price the buyer
shall have what he bought until the year of the jubilee for in that
year all that is sold shall return to the owner and to the ancient
possessor
he that selleth a house within the walls of a city shall have
the liberty to redeem it until one year be expired
if he redeem it not and the whole year be fully out the buyer
shall possess it and his posterity for ever and it cannot be redeemed
not even in the jubilee
but if the house be in a village that hath no walls it shall be
sold according to the same law as the fields if it be not redeemed
before in the jubilee it shall return to the owner
the houses of levites which are in cities may always be
redeemed
if they be not redeemed in the jubilee they shall all return to
the owners because the houses of the cities of the levites are for
their possessions among the children of israel
but let not their suburbs be sold because it is a perpetual
possession
if thy brother be impoverished and weak of hand and thou
receive him as a stranger and sojourner and he live with thee
take not usury of him nor more than thou gavest fear thy god
that thy brother may live with thee
thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor exact of him
any increase of fruits
i am the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt
that i might give you the land of chanaan and might be your god
if thy brother constrained by poverty sell himself to thee thou
shalt not oppress him with the service of bondservants
but he shall be as a hireling and a sojourner he shall work
with thee until the year of the jubilee
and afterwards he shall go out with his children and shall
return to his kindred and to the possession of his fathers
for they are my servants and i brought them out of the land of
afflict him not by might but fear thy god
let your bondmen and your bondwomen be of the nations that are
round about you
and of the strangers that sojourn among you or that were born of
them in your land these you shall have for servants
and by right of inheritance shall leave them to your posterity
and shall possess them for ever but oppress not your brethren the
children of israel by might
if the hand of a stranger or a sojourner grow strong among you
and thy brother being impoverished sell himself to him or to any of his
race
after the sale he may be redeemed he that will of his brethren
shall redeem him
either his uncle or his uncles son or his kinsman by blood
or by affinity but if he himself be able also he shall redeem himself
counting only the years from the time of his selling unto the
year of the jubilee and counting the money that he was sold for
according to the number of the years and the reckoning of a hired
servant
if there be many years that remain until the jubilee according
to them shall he also repay the price
if few he shall make the reckoning with him according to the
number of the years and shall repay to the buyer of what remaineth of
the years
his wages being allowed for which he served before he shall not
afflict him violently in thy sight
and if by these means he cannot be redeemed in the year of the
jubilee he shall go out with his children
for the children of israel are my servants whom i brought forth
out of the land of egypt
punishments with which he threatens transgressors
i am the lord your god you shall not make to yourselves any idol
or graven thing neither shall you erect pillars nor set up a
remarkable stone in your land to adore it for i am the lord your god
keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am the lord
if you walk in my precepts and keep my commandments and do them
and the ground shall bring forth its increase and the trees shall
be filled with fruit
the threshing of your harvest shall reach unto the vintage and
the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time and you shall eat your
bread to the full and dwell in your land without fear
i will give peace in your coasts you shall sleep and there shall
be none to make you afraid i will take away evil beasts and the sword
shall not pass through your quarters
you shall pursue your enemies and they shall fall before you
five of yours shall pursue a hundred others and a hundred of you
ten thousand your enemies shall fall before you by the sword
i will look on you and make you increase you shall be
multiplied and i will establish my covenant with you
you shall eat the oldest of the old store and new coming on
you shall cast away the old
i will set my tabernacle in the midst of you and my soul shall
not cast you off
i will walk among you and will be your god and you shall be my
people
i am the lord your god who have brought you out of the land of
the egyptians that you should not serve them and who have broken the
chains of your necks that you might go upright
but if you will not hear me nor do all my commandments
if you despise my laws and contemn my judgments so as not to do
those things which are appointed by me and to make void my covenant
i also will do these things to you i will quickly visit you with
poverty and burning heat which shall waste your eyes and consume your
lives you shall sow your seed in vain which shall be devoured by your
enemies
i will set my face against you and you shall fall down before
your enemies and shall be made subject to them that hate you you shall
flee when no man pursueth you
but if you will not yet for all this obey me i will chastise you
seven times more for your sins
and i will break the pride of your stubbornness and i will make
to you the heaven above as iron and the earth as brass
your labour shall be spent in vain the ground shall not bring
forth her increase nor the trees yield their fruit
if you walk contrary to me and will not hearken to me i will
bring seven times more plagues upon you for your sins
and i will send in upon you the beasts of the field to destroy
you and your cattle and make you few in number and that your highways
may be desolate
and if even so you will not amend but will walk contrary to me
i also will walk contrary to you and will strike you seven times
for your sins
and i will bring in upon you the sword that shall avenge my
covenant and when you shall flee into the cities i will send the
pestilence in the midst of you and you shall be delivered into the
hands of your enemies
after i shall have broken the staff of your bread so that ten
women shall bake your bread in one oven and give it out by weight and
you shall eat and shall not be filled
but if you will not for all this hearken to me but will walk
against me
i will also go against you with opposite fury and i will
chastise you with seven plagues for your sins
so that you shall eat the flesh of your sons and of your
daughters
i will destroy your high places and break your idols you shall
fall among the ruins of your idols and my soul shall abhor you
insomuch that i will bring your cities to be a wilderness and i
will make your sanctuaries desolate and will receive no more your sweet
odours
and i will destroy your land and your enemies shall be
astonished at it when they shall be the inhabitants thereof
and i will scatter you among the gentiles and i will draw out
the sword after you and your land shall be desert and your cities
destroyed
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths all the days of her
desolation when you shall be
in the enemys land she shall keep a sabbath and rest in the
sabbaths of her desolation because she did not rest in your sabbaths
when you dwelt therein
and as to them that shall remain of you i will send fear in their
hearts in the countries of their enemies the sound of a flying leaf
shall terrify them and they shall flee as it were from the sword they
shall fall when no man pursueth them
and they shall every one fall upon their brethren as fleeing from
wars none of you shall dare to resist your enemies
you shall perish among the gentiles and an enemys land shall
consume you
and if of them also some remain they shall pine away in their
iniquities in the land of their enemies and they shall be afflicted
for the sins of their fathers and their own
until they confess their iniquities and the iniquities of their
ancestors whereby they have transgressed against me and walked
contrary unto me
therefore i also will walk against them and bring them into
their enemies land until their uncircumcised mind be ashamed then
shall they pray for their sins
and i will remember my covenant that i made with jacob and
which when she shall be left by them shall enjoy her sabbaths
being desolate for them but they shall pray for their sins because
they rejected my judgments and despised my laws
and yet for all that when they were in the land of their enemies
they should be quite consumed and i should make void my covenant with
them for i am the lord their god
and i will remember my former covenant when i brought them out
of the land of egypt in the sight of the gentiles to be their god i
am the lord these are the judgments and precepts and laws which the
hand of moses
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say to them the
man that shall have made a vow and promised his soul to god shall give
the price according to estimation
if it be a man from twenty years old unto sixty years old he
shall give fifty sicles of silver after the weight of the sanctuary
if a woman thirty
but from the fifth year until the twentieth a man shall give
twenty sicles a woman ten
from one month until the fifth year for a male shall be given
five sicles for a female three
a man that is sixty years old or upward shall give fifteen
sicles a woman ten
if he be poor and not able to pay the estimation he shall stand
before the priest and as much as he shall value him at and see him
able to pay so much shall he give
but a beast that may be sacrificed to the lord if any one shall
vow shall be holy
and cannot be changed that is to say neither a better for a
worse nor a worse for a better and if he shall change it both that
which was changed and that for which it was changed shall be
consecrated to the lord
an unclean beast which cannot be sacrificed to the lord if any
man shall vow shall be brought before the priest
who judging whether it be good or bad shall set the price
which if he that offereth it will give he shall add above the
estimation the fifth part
if a man shall vow his house and sanctify it to the lord the
priest shall consider it whether it be good or bad and it shall be
sold according to the price which he shall appoint
but if he that vowed will redeem it he shall give the fifth
part of the estimation over and above and shall have the house
and if he vow the field of his possession and consecrate it to
the lord the price shall be rated according to the measure of the seed
fifty sicles of silver
if he vow his field immediately from the year of jubilee that is
beginning as much as it may be worth at so much it shall be rated
but if some time after the priest shall reckon the money
according to the number of years that remain until the jubilee and the
price shall be abated
and if he that had vowed will redeem his field he shall add the
fifth part of the money of the estimation and shall possess it
and if he will not redeem it but it be sold to any other man he
that vowed it may not redeem it any more
for when the day of jubilee cometh it shall be sanctified to the
priest
if a field that was bought and not of a mans ancestors
possession be sanctified to the lord
the priest shall reckon the price according to the number of
years unto the jubilee and he that had vowed shall give that to the
but in the jubilee it shall return to the former owner who had
sold it and had it in the lot of his possession
all estimation shall be made according to the sicle of the
sanctuary a sicle hath twenty obols
the firstborn which belong to the lord no man may sanctify and
vow whether it be bullock or sheep they are the lords
and if it be an unclean beast he that offereth it shall redeem
it according to thy estimation and shall add the fifth part of the
price if he will not redeem it it shall be sold to another for how
much soever it was estimated by thee
any thing that is devoted to the lord whether it be man or
beast or field shall not be sold neither may it be redeemed
and any consecration that is offered by man shall not be
redeemed but dying shall die
all tithes of the land whether of corn or of the fruits of
trees are the lords and are sanctified to him
and if any man will redeem his tithes he shall add the fifth
part of them
of all the tithes of oxen and sheep and goats that pass under
the shepherds rod every tenth that cometh shall be sanctified to the
it shall not be chosen neither good nor bad neither shall it be
changed for another if any man change it both that which was changed
and that for which it was changed shall be sanctified to the lord and
shall not be redeemed
these are the precepts which the lord commanded moses for the
children of israel in mount sinai
numbering of the people the hebrews from its first words call it
second month of the second year after their going out of egypt until
the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year that is a
history almost of thirtynine years
