now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month on
the fifth day of the month when i was in the midst of the captives by
the river chobar the heavens were opened and i saw the visions of god
have it from the solemn covenant made in the eighteenth year of the
reign of josias kings
on the fifth day of the month the same was the fifth year of the
captivity of king joachin
the word of the lord came to ezechiel the priest the son of buzi in
the land of the chaldeans by the river chobar and the hand of the lord
was there upon him
and i saw and behold a whirlwind came out of the north and a
great cloud and a fire infolding it and brightness was about it and
out of the midst thereof that is out of the midst of the fire as it
were the resemblance of amber
and in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures and
this was their appearance there was the likeness of a man in them
represented to the prophet under these mysterious shapes as supporting
the throne of god and as it were drawing his chariot all this chapter
appeared so obscure and so full of mysteries to the ancient hebrews
that as we learn from st jerome ep ad paulin they suffered none
to read it before they were thirty years old
every one had four faces and every one four wings
their feet were straight feet and the sole of their foot was like
the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like the appearance of
glowing brass
and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four
sides and they had faces and wings on the four sides
and the wings of one were joined to the wings of another they
turned not when they went but every one went straight forward
and as for the likeness of their faces there was the face of a
man and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four and the
face of an ox on the left side of all the four and the face of an
eagle over all the four
and their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings
of every one were joined and two covered their bodies
and every one of them went straight forward whither the impulse
of the spirit was to go thither they went and they turned not when
they went
and as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance
was like that of burning coals of fire and like the appearance of
lamps this was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living
creatures a bright fire and lightning going forth from the fire
and the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of
lightning
now as i beheld the living creatures there appeared upon the
earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces
and the appearance of the wheels and the work of them was like
the appearance of the sea and the four had all one likeness and their
appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a
wheel
when they went they went by their four parts and they turned not
when they went
to any of their sides either forward or backward to the right or to the
left
the wheels had also a size and a height and a dreadful
appearance and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the
four
and when the living creatures went the wheels also went together
by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth
the wheels also were lifted up with them
withersoever the spirit went thither as the spirit went the
wheels also were lifted up withal and followed it for the spirit of
life was in the wheels
when those went these went and when those stood these stood and
when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up
together and followed them for the spirit of life was in the wheels
and over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the
firmament the appearance of crystal terrible to behold and stretched
out over their heads above
and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward
the other every one with two wings covered his body and the other was
covered in like manner
and i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of many
waters as it were the voice of the most high god when they walked it
was like the voice of a multitude like the noise of an army and when
they stood their wings were let down
for when a voice came from above the firmament that was over
their heads they stood and let down their wings
and above the firmament that was over their heads was the
likeness of a throne as the appearance of the sapphire stone and upon
the likeness of the throne was the likeness of the appearance of a man
above upon it
and i saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance of
fire within it round about from his loins and upward and from his
loins downward i saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round
about
as the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy
day this was the appearance of the brightness round about
this was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the lord and i
saw and i fell upon my face and i heard the voice of one that spoke
and he said to me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak to
thee
and the spirit entered into me after that he spoke to me and he
set me upon my feet and i heard him speaking to me
and saying son of man i send thee to the children of israel to a
rebellious people that hath revolted from me they and their fathers
have transgressed my covenant even unto this day
and they to whom i send thee are children of a hard face and of an
obstinate heart and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord god
if so be they at least will hear and if so be they will forbear
for they are a provoking house and they shall know that there hath been
a prophet in the midst of them
and thou o son of man fear not neither be thou afraid of their
words for thou art among unbelievers and destroyers and thou dwellest
with scorpions fear not their words neither be thou dismayed at their
looks for they are a provoking house
and thou shalt speak my words to them if perhaps they will hear
and forbear for they provoke me to anger
but thou o son of man hear all that i say to thee and do not
thou provoke me as that house provoketh me open thy mouth and eat
what i give thee
and i looked and behold a hand was sent to me wherein was a book
rolled up and he spread it before me and it was written within and
without and there were written in it lamentations and canticles and
woe
of a watchman
and he said to me son of man eat all that thou shalt find eat
this book and go speak to the children of israel
of the book was signified the diligent attention and affection with
which we are to receive and embrace the word of god and to let it as
it were sink into our interior by devout meditation
and i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that book
and he said to me son of man thy belly shall eat and thy bowels
shall be filled with this book which i give thee and i did eat it and
it was sweet as honey in my mouth
and he said to me son of man go to the house of israel and thou
shalt speak my words to them
for thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech and of an
unknown tongue but to the house of israel
nor to many nations of a strange speech and of an unknown tongue
whose words thou canst not understand and if thou wert sent to them
they would hearken to thee
but the house of israel will not hearken to thee because they will
not hearken to me for all the house of israel are of a hard forehead
and an obstinate heart
behold i have made thy face stronger than their faces and thy
forehead harder than their foreheads
i have made thy face like an adamant and like flint fear them not
neither be thou dismayed at their presence for they are a provoking
house
and he said to me son of man receive in thy heart and hear with
thy ears all the words that i speak to thee
and go get thee in to them of the captivity to the children of
thy people and thou shalt speak to them and shalt say to them thus
saith the lord if so be they will hear and will forbear
and the spirit took me up and i heard behind me the voice of a
great commotion saying blessed be the glory of the lord from his
place
the noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one
against another and the noise of the wheels following the living
creatures and the noise of a great commotion
the spirit also lifted me and took me up and i went away in
bitterness in the indignation of my spirit for the hand of the lord was
with me strengthening me
and i came to them of the captivity to the heap of new corn to
them that dwelt by the river chobar and i sat where they sat and i
remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them
and at the end of seven days the word of the lord came to me
saying
son of man i have made thee a watchman to the house of israel
and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth and shalt tell it them
from me
if when i say to the wicked thou shalt surely die thou declare
it not to him nor speak to him that he may be converted from his
wicked way and live the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but
but if thou give warning to the wicked and he be not converted
from his wickedness and from his evil way he indeed shall die in his
iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul
moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice and
shall commit iniquity i will lay a stumblingblock before him he shall
die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin
and his justices which he hath done shall not be remembered but i will
require his blood at thy hand
but if thou warn the just man that the just may not sin and he
doth not sin living he shall live because thou hast warned him and
thou hast delivered thy soul
and the hand of the lord was upon me and he said to me rise and
go forth into the plain and there i will speak to thee
and i rose up and went forth into the plain and behold the glory
of the lord stood there like the glory which i saw by the river chobar
and i fell upon my face
and the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and he
spoke to me and said to me go in and shut thyself up in the midst of
thy house
and thou o son of man behold they shall put bands upon thee and
they shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go forth from the
midst of them
and i will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth
and thou shalt be dumb and not as a man that reproveth because they
are a provoking house
but when i shall speak to thee i will open thy mouth and thou
shalt say to them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him
hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a provoking
house
shall reign there
and thou o son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee
and draw upon it the plan of the city of jerusalem
and lay siege against it and build forts and cast up a mount and
set a camp against it and place battering rams round about it
and take unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron
between thee and the city and set thy face resolutely against it and
it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it it is a sign
to the house of israel
and thou shalt sleep upon thy left side and shalt lay the
iniquities of the house of israel upon it according to the number of
the days that thou shalt sleep upon it and thou shalt take upon thee
their iniquity
and i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to
the number of the days three hundred and ninety days and thou shalt
bear the iniquity of the house of israel
and when thou hast accomplished this thou shalt sleep again upon
thy right side and thou shalt take upon thee the iniquity of the house
of juda forty days a day for a year yea a day for a year i have
appointed to thee
and thou shalt turn thy face to the siege of jerusalem and thy arm
shall be stretched out and thou shalt prophesy against it
behold i have encompassed thee with bands and thou shalt not turn
thyself from one side to the other till thou hast ended the days of thy
siege
and take to thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and
millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread
thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy
side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof
and thy meat that thou shalt eat shall be in weight twenty
staters a day from time to time thou shalt eat it
and thou shalt drink water by measure the sixth part of a hin
from time to time thou shalt drink it
and thou shalt eat it as barley bread baked under the ashes and
thou shalt cover it in their sight with the dung that cometh out of a
man
and the lord said so shall the children of israel eat their bread
all filthy among the nations whither i will cast them out
and i said ah ah ah o lord god behold my soul hath not been
defiled and from my infancy even till now i have not eaten any thing
that died of itself or was torn by beasts and no unclean flesh hath
entered into my mouth
and he said to me behold i have given thee neats dung for mans
dung and thou shalt make thy bread therewith
and he said to me son of man behold i will break in pieces the
staff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and
with care and they shall drink water by measure and in distress
so that when bread and water fail every man may fall against his
brother and they may pine away in their iniquities
prophets hair
and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife that shaveth the
hair and cause it to pass over thy head and over thy beard and take
thee a balance to weigh in and divide the hair
a third part thou shalt burn with fire in the midst of the city
according to the fulfilling of the days of the siege and thou shalt
take a third part and cut it in pieces with the knife all round about
and the other third part thou shalt scatter in the wind and i will draw
out the sword after them
and thou shalt take thereof a small number and shalt bind them in
the skirt of thy cloak
and thou shalt take of them again and shalt cast them in the midst
of the fire and shalt burn them with fire and out of it shall come
forth a fire into all the house of israel
thus saith the lord god this is jerusalem i have set her in the
midst of the nations and the countries round about her
and she hath despised my judgments so as to be more wicked than
the gentiles and my commandments more than the countries that are
round about her for they have cast off my judgments and have not
walked in my commandments
therefore thus saith the lord god because you have surpassed the
commandments and have not kept my judgments and have not done
according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i come against thee and
and i will do in thee that which i have not done and the like to
which i will do no more because of all thy abominations
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee and
the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments in thee
and i will scatter thy whole remnant into every wind
therefore as i live saith the lord god because thou hast
violated my sanctuary with all thy offences and with all thy
abominations i will also break thee in pieces and my eye shall not
spare and i will not have any pity
a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and shall be
consumed with famine in the midst of thee and a third part of thee
shall fall by the sword round about thee and a third part of thee will
and i will accomplish my fury and will cause my indignation to
rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that i the
indignation in them
and i will make thee desolate and a reproach among the nations
that are round about thee in the sight of every one that passeth by
and thou shalt be a reproach and a scoff an example and an
astonishment amongst the nations that are round about thee when i shall
have executed judgments in thee in anger and in indignation and in
wrathful rebukes
i the lord have spoken it when i shall send upon them the
grievous arrows of famine which shall bring death and which i will
send to destroy you and i will gather together famine against you and
and i will send in upon you famine and evil beasts unto utter
destruction and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and i
will bring in the sword upon thee i the lord have spoken it
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man set thy face towards the mountains of israel and
prophesy against them
and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god
rocks and the valleys behold i will bring upon you the sword and i
will destroy your high places
and i will throw down your altars and your idols shall be broken
in pieces and i will cast down your slain before your idols
and i will lay the dead carcasses of the children of israel before
your idols and i will scatter your bones round about your altars
in all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste and
the high places shall be thrown down and destroyed and your altars
shall be abolished and shall be broken in pieces and your idols shall
be no more and your temples shall be destroyed and your works shall be
defaced
and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and you shall know
that i am the lord
and i will leave in you some that shall escape the sword among the
nations when i shall have scattered you through the countries
and they that are saved of you shall remember me amongst the
nations to which they are carried captives because i have broken their
heart that was faithless and revolted from me and their eyes that went
a fornicating after their idols and they shall be displeased with
themselves because of the evils which they have committed in all their
abominations
and they shall know that i the lord have not spoken in vain that i
would do this evil to them
thus saith the lord god strike with thy hand and stamp with thy
foot and say alas for all the abominations of the evils of the house
of israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the
pestilence
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is
near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged
shall die by the famine and i will accomplish my indignation upon them
and you shall know that i am the lord when your slain shall be
amongst your idols round about your altars in every high hill and on
all the tops of mountains and under every woody tree and under every
thick oak the place where they burnt sweet smelling frankincense to all
their idols
and i will stretch forth my hand upon them and i will make the
land desolate and abandoned from the desert of deblatha in all their
dwelling places and they shall know that i am the lord
and the word of the lord came to me saying
and thou son of man thus saith the lord god to the land of israel
now is an end come upon thee and i will send my wrath upon thee
and i will judge thee according to thy ways and i will set all thy
abominations against thee
and my eye shall not spare thee and i will shew thee no pity but
midst of thee and you shall know that i am the lord
thus saith the lord god one affliction behold an affliction is
come
an end is come the end is come it hath awaked against thee
behold it is come
destruction is come upon thee that dwellest in the land the time
is come the day of slaughter is near and not of the joy of mountains
now very shortly i will pour out my wrath upon thee and i will
accomplish my anger in thee and i will judge thee according to thy
ways and i will lay upon thee all thy crimes
and my eye shall not spare neither will i shew mercy but i will
lay thy ways upon thee and thy abominations shall be in the midst of
thee and you shall know that i am the lord that strike
behold the day behold it is come destruction is gone forth the
rod hath blossomed pride hath budded
iniquity is risen up into a rod of impiety nothing of them shall
remain nor of their people nor of the noise of them and there shall
be no rest among them
the time is come the day is at hand let not the buyer rejoice
nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the people thereof
for the seller shall not return to that which he hath sold
although their life be yet among the living for the vision which
regardeth all the multitude thereof shall not go back neither shall
man be strengthened in the iniquity of his life
blow the trumpet let all be made ready yet there is none to go
to the battle for my wrath shall be upon all the people thereof
the sword without and the pestilence and the famine within he
that is in the field shall die by the sword and they that are in the
city shall be devoured by the pestilence and the famine
and such of them as shall flee shall escape and they shall be in
the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them trembling every
one for his iniquity
all hands shall be made feeble and all knees shall run with
water
and they shall gird themselves with haircloth and fear shall
cover them and shame shall be upon every face and baldness upon all
their heads
their silver shall be cast forth and their gold shall become a
dunghill their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them
in the day of the wrath of the lord they shall not satisfy their soul
and their bellies shall not be filled because it hath been the
stumblingblock of their iniquity
and they have turned the ornament of their jewels into pride and
have made of it the images of their abominations and idols therefore i
have made it an uncleanness to them
and i will give it into the hands of strangers for spoil and to
the wicked of the earth for a prey and they shall defile it
and i will turn away my face from them and they shall violate my
secret place and robbers shall enter into it and defile it
make a shutting up for the land is full of the judgment of
blood and the city is full of iniquity
captivity
and i will bring the worst of the nations and they shall possess
their houses and i will make the pride of the mighty to cease and they
shall possess their sanctuary
when distress cometh upon them they will seek for peace and there
shall be none
trouble shall come upon trouble and rumour upon rumour and they
shall seek a vision of the prophet and the law shall perish from the
priest and counsel from the ancients
the king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with sorrow
and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled i will do to
them according to their way and will judge them according to their
judgments and they shall know that i am the lord
which determine the lord to spare them no longer
and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the
fifth day of the month as i sat in my house and the ancients of juda
sat before me that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me
and i saw and behold a likeness as the appearance of fire from
the appearance of his loins and downward fire and from his loins and
upward as the appearance of brightness as the appearance of amber
and the likeness of a hand was put forth and took me by a lock of
my head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven
and brought me in the vision of god into jerusalem near the inner gate
that looked toward the north where was set the idol of jealousy to
provoke to jealousy
and behold the glory of the god of israel was there according to
the vision which i had seen in the plain
and he said to me son of man lift up thy eyes towards the way of
the north and i lifted up my eyes towards the way of the north and
behold on the north side of the gate of the altar the idol of jealousy
in the very entry
and he said to me son of man dost thou see thinkest thou what
these are doing the great abominations that the house of israel
committeth here that i should depart far off from my sanctuary and
turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations
and he brought me in to the door of the court and i saw and
behold a hole in the wall
and he said to me son of man dig in the wall and when i had
digged in the wall behold a door
and he said to me go in and see the wicked abominations which
they commit here
and i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things
and of living creatures the abominations and all the idols of the
house of israel were painted on the wall all round about
and seventy men of the ancients of the house of israel and
before the pictures and every one had a censer in his hand and a cloud
of smoke went up from the incense
and he said to me surely thou seest o son of man what the
ancients of the house of israel do in the dark every one in private in
his chamber for they say the lord seeth us not the lord hath forsaken
the earth
and he said to me if thou turn thee again thou shalt see greater
abominations which these commit
and he brought me in by the door of the gate of the lords house
which looked to the north and behold women sat there mourning for
the heathen poets and which being here represented by an idol is
lamented by the female worshippers of that goddess in the hebrew the
name is tammuz
and he said to me surely thou hast seen o son of man but turn
thee again thou shalt see greater abominations than these
and he brought me into the inner court of the house of the lord
and behold at the door of the temple of the lord between the porch and
the altar were about five and twenty men having their backs towards the
temple of the lord in their faces to the east and they adored towards
the rising of the sun
and he said to me surely thou hast seen o son of man is this a
light thing to the house of juda that they should commit these
abominations which they have committed here because they have filled
the land with iniquity and have turned to provoke me to anger and
behold they put a branch to their nose
therefore i also will deal with them in my wrath my eye shall not
spare them neither will i shew mercy and when they shall cry to my
ears with a loud voice i will not hear them
and he cried in my ears with a loud voice saying the visitations
of the city are at hand and every one hath a destroying weapon in his
hand
and behold six men came from the way of the upper gate which
looketh to the north and each one had his weapon of destruction in his
hand and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with linen
with a writers inkhorn at his reins and they went in and stood by the
brazen altar
and the glory of the lord of israel went up from the cherub upon
which he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man
that was clothed with linen and had a writers inkhorn at his loins
and the lord said to him go through the midst of the city through
the midst of jerusalem and mark thau upon the foreheads of the men that
sigh and mourn for all the abominations that are committed in the midst
thereof
and signifies a sign or a mark which is the reason why some
translators render this place set a mark or mark a mark without
specifying what this mark was but st jerome and other interpreters
conclude it was the form of the letter thau which in the ancient hebrew
character was the form of a cross
and to the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through
the city and strike let not your eyes spare nor be ye moved with
pity
utterly destroy old and young maidens children and women but
upon whomsoever you shall see thau kill him not and begin ye at my
sanctuary so they began at the ancient men who were before the house
and he said to them defile the house and fill the courts with the
slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew them that were in the
city
and the slaughter being ended i was left and i fell upon my face
and crying i said alas alas alas o lord god wilt thou then destroy
all the remnant of israel by pouring out thy fury upon jerusalem
and he said to me the iniquity of the house of israel and of
city is filled with perverseness for they have said the lord hath
forsaken the earth and the lord seeth not
therefore neither shall my eye spare nor will i have pity i will
requite their way upon their head
and behold the man that was clothed with linen that had the
inkhorn at his back returned the word saying i have done as thou hast
commanded me
scattered over the city a description of the cherubims
and i saw and behold in the firmament that was over the heads of
the cherubims there appeared over them as it were the sapphire stone
as the appearance of the likeness of a throne
and he spoke to the man that was clothed with linen and said go
in between the wheels that are under the cherubims and fill thy hand
with the coals of fire that are between the cherubims and pour them out
upon the city and he went in in my sight
and the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the
man went in and a cloud filled the inner court
and the glory of the lord was lifted up from above the cherub to
the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and
the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the lord
and the sound of the wings of the cherubims was heard even to the
outward court as the voice of god almighty speaking
and when he had commanded the man that was clothed with linen
saying take fire from the midst of the wheels that are between the
cherubims he went in and stood beside the wheel
and one cherub stretched out his arm from the midst of the
cherubims to the fire that was between the cherubims and he took and
put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen who took it
and went forth
and there appeared in the cherubims the likeness of a mans hand
under their wings
and i saw and behold there were four wheels by the cherubims one
wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and the
appearance of the wheels was to the sight like the chrysolite stone
and as to their appearance all four were alike as if a wheel
were in the midst of a wheel
and when they went they went by four ways and they turned not
when they went but to the place whither they first turned the rest
also followed and did not turn back
the right or to the left
and their whole body and their necks and their hands and their
wings and the circles were full of eyes round about the four wheels
and these wheels he called voluble in my hearing
and every one had four faces one face was the face of a cherub
and the second face the face of a man and in the third was the face of
a lion and in the fourth the face of an eagle
and the cherubims were lifted up this is the living creature
that i had seen by the river chobar
and when the cherubims went the wheels also went by them and
when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth
the wheels stayed not behind but were by them
when they stood these stood and when they were lifted up these
were lifted up for the spirit of life was in them
and the glory of the lord went forth from the threshold of the
temple and stood over the cherubims
and the cherubims lifting up their wings were raised from the
earth before me and as they went out the wheels also followed and it
stood in the entry of the east gate of the house of the lord and the
glory of the god of israel was over them
this is the living creature which i saw under the god of israel
by the river chobar and i understood that they were cherubims
each one had four faces and each one had four wings and the
likeness of a mans hand was under their wings
and as to the likeness of their faces they were the same faces
which i had seen by the river chobar and their looks and the impulse
of every one to go straight forward
remnant shall be saved and receive a new spirit and a new heart
and the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the east gate of
the house of the lord which looketh towards the rising of the sun and
behold in the entry of the gate five and twenty men and i saw in the
midst of them jezonias the son of azur and pheltias the son of banaias
princes of the people
and he said to me son of man these are the men that study
iniquity and frame a wicked counsel in this city
saying were not houses lately built this city is the caldron
and we the flesh
and threats of the prophets who declared to them from god that the
city should be destroyed and the inhabitants carried into captivity
and they made use of this kind of argument against the prophets that
the city so far from being like to be destroyed had lately been
augmented by the building of new houses from whence they further
inferred by way of a proverb using the similitude of a cauldron out
of which the flesh is not taken till it is thoroughly boiled and fit
to be eaten that they should not be carried away out of their city but
there end their days in peace
therefore prophesy against them prophesy thou son of man
and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said to me speak
the thoughts of your heart
you have killed a great many in this city and you have filled the
streets thereof with the slain
therefore thus saith the lord god your slain whom you have laid
in the midst thereof they are the flesh all this is the caldron and i
will bring you forth out of the midst thereof
you have feared the sword and i will bring the sword upon you
saith the lord god
and i will cast you out of the midst thereof and i will deliver
you into the hand of the enemies and i will execute judgments upon you
you shall fall by the sword i will judge you in the borders of
in jerusalem god tells them it should not be so but that they should
be judged and condemned and fall by the sword in the borders of israel
viz in reblatha in the land of emath where all their chief men were
put to death by nabuchodonosor kings and jer
this shall not be as a caldron to you and you shall not be as
flesh in the midst thereof i will judge you in the borders of israel
and you shall know that i am the lord because you have not
walked in my commandments and have not done my judgments but you have
done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you
and it came to pass when i prophesied that pheltias the son of
voice and said alas alas alas o lord god wilt thou make an end of
all the remnant of israel
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man thy brethren thy brethren thy kinsmen and all the
house of israel all they to whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have
said get ye far from the lord the land is given in possession to us
captives before who were despised by them that remained in jerusalem
but as the prophet here declares to them from god should be in a more
happy condition than they and after some time return from their
captivity
therefore thus saith the lord god because i have removed them
far off among the gentiles and because i have scattered them among the
countries i will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries whither
they are come
therefore speak to them thus saith the lord god i will gather
you from among the peoples and assemble you out of the countries
wherein you are scattered and i will give you the land of israel
and they shall go in thither and shall take away all the
scandals and all the abominations thereof from thence
and i will give them one heart and will put a new spirit in
their bowels and i will take away the stony heart out of their flesh
and will give them a heart of flesh
that they may walk in my commandments and keep my judgments and
do them and that they may be my people and i may be their god
but as for them whose heart walketh after their scandals and
abominations i will lay their way upon their head saith the lord god
and the cherubims lifted up their wings and the wheels with
them and the glory of the god of israel was over them
and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city and
stood over the mount that is on the east side of the city
and the spirit lifted me up and brought me into chaldea to them
of the captivity in vision by the spirit of god and the vision which
and i spoke to them of the captivity all the words of the lord
which he had shewn me
desolation of the people all which shall quickly come to pass
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man thou dwellest in the midst of a provoking house who
have eyes to see and see not and ears to hear and hear not for they
are a provoking house
thou therefore o son of man prepare thee all necessaries for
removing and remove by day into their sight and thou shalt remove out
of thy place to another place in their sight if so be they will regard
it for they are a provoking house
and thou shalt bring forth thy furniture as the furniture of one
that is removing by day in their sight and thou shalt go forth in the
evening in their presence as one goeth forth that removeth his
dwelling
dig thee a way through the wall before their eyes and thou shalt
go forth through it
in their sight thou shalt be carried out upon mens shoulders
thou shalt be carried out in the dark thou shalt cover thy face and
shalt not see the ground for i have set thee for a sign of things to
come to the house of israel
i did therefore as he had commanded me i brought forth my goods
by day as the goods of one that removeth and in the evening i digged
through the wall with my hand and i went forth in the dark and was
carried on mens shoulders in their sight
and the word of the lord came to me in the morning saying
son of man hath not the house of israel the provoking house
said to thee what art thou doing
say to them thus saith the lord god this burden concerneth my
prince that is in jerusalem and all the house of israel that are among
them
say i am a sign of things to come to you as i have done so
shall it be done to them they shall be removed from their dwellings
and go into captivity
and the prince that is in the midst of them shall be carried on
shoulders he shall go forth in the dark they shall dig through the
wall to bring him out his face shall be covered that he may not see
the ground with his eyes
and i will spread my net over him and he shall be taken in my
net and i will bring him into babylon into the land of the chaldeans
and he shall not see it and there he shall die
and all that are about him his guards and his troops i will
scatter into every wind and i will draw out the sword after them
and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall have
dispersed them among the nations and scattered them in the countries
and i will leave a few men of them from the sword and from the
famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their wicked
deeds among the nations whither they shall go and they shall know that
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man eat thy bread in trouble and drink thy water in hurry
and sorrow
and say to the people of the land thus saith the lord god to
them that dwell in jerusalem in the land of israel they shall eat their
bread in care and drink their water in desolation that the land may
become desolate from the multitude that is therein for the iniquity of
all that dwell therein
and the cities that are now inhabited shall be laid waste and
the land shall be desolate and you shall know that i am the lord
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man what is this proverb that you have in the land of
fail
say to them therefore thus saith the lord god i will make this
proverb to cease neither shall it be any more a common saying in
vision
for there shall be no more any vain visions nor doubtful
divination in the midst of the children of israel
for i the lord will speak and what word soever i shall speak it
shall come to pass and shall not be prolonged any more but in your
days ye provoking house i will speak the word and will do it saith
the lord god
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man behold the house of israel they that say the
visions that this man seeth is for many days to come and this man
prophesieth of times afar off
therefore say to them thus saith the lord god not one word of
mine shall be prolonged any more the word that i shall speak shall be
accomplished saith the lord god
people with lies
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man prophesy thou against the prophets of israel that
prophesy and thou shalt say to them that prophesy out of their own
heart hear ye the word of the lord
thus saith the lord god woe to the foolish prophets that follow
their own spirit and see nothing
thy prophets o israel were like foxes in the deserts
you have not gone up to face the enemy nor have you set up a wall
for the house of israel to stand in battle in the day of the lord
they see vain things and they foretell lies saying the lord
saith whereas the lord hath not sent them and they have persisted to
confirm what they have said
have you not seen a vain vision and spoken a lying divination and
you say the lord saith whereas i have not spoken
therefore thus saith the lord god because you have spoken vain
things and have seen lies therefore behold i come against you saith
the lord god
and my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vain things and
that divine lies they shall not be in the council of my people nor
shall they be written in the writing of the house of israel neither
shall they enter into the land of israel and you shall know that i am
the lord god
because they have deceived my people saying peace and there is
no peace and the people built up a wall and they daubed it with dirt
without straw
say to them that daub without tempering that it shall fall for
there shall be an overflowing shower and i will cause great hailstones
to fall violently from above and a stormy wind to throw it down
behold when the wall is fallen shall it not be said to you
therefore thus saith the lord god lo i will cause a stormy wind
to break forth in my indignation and there shall be an overflowing
shower in my anger and great hailstones in my wrath to consume
and i will break down the wall that you have daubed with
untempered mortar and i will make it even with the ground and the
foundation thereof shall be laid bare and it shall fall and shall be
consumed in the midst thereof and you shall know that i am the lord
and i will accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that
daub it without tempering the mortar and i will say to you the wall is
no more and they that daub it are no more
even the prophets of israel that prophesy to jerusalem and that
see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord god
and thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy
people that prophesy out of their own heart and do thou prophesy
against them
and say thus saith the lord god woe to them that sew cushions
under every elbow and make pillows for the heads of persons of every
age to catch souls and when they caught the souls of my people they
gave life to their souls
promising them impunityibid they gave life to their souls that is
they flattered them with promises of life peace and security
and they violated me among my people for a handful of barley
and a piece of bread to kill souls which should not die and to save
souls alive which should not live telling lies to my people that
believe lies
souls etc that is to sentence souls to death which are not to die
and to promise life to them who are not to live
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i declare against your
cushions wherewith you catch flying souls and i will tear them off
from your arms and i will let go the soul that you catch the souls
that should fly
and i will tear your pillows and will deliver my people out of
your hand neither shall they be any more in your hands to be a prey
and you shall know that i am the lord
because with lies you have made the heart of the just to mourn
whom i have not made sorrowful and have strengthened the hands of the
wicked that he should not return from his evil way and live
therefore you shall not see vain things nor divine divinations
any more and i will deliver my people out of your hand and you shall
know that i am the lord
not be delivered by the prayers of noe daniel and job but a remnant
shall be preserved
and some of the ancients of israel came to me and sat before me
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man these men have placed their uncleannesses in their
hearts and have set up before their face the stumblingblock of their
iniquity and shall i answer when they inquire of me
their hearts and which are a stumblingblock to their souls
therefore speak to them and say to them thus saith the lord god
his heart and set up the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his
face and shall come to the prophet inquiring of me by him i the lord
will answer him according to the multitude of his uncleannesses
that the house of israel may be caught in their own heart with
which they have departed from me through all their idols
therefore say to the house of israel thus saith the lord god be
converted and depart from your idols and turn away your faces from all
your abominations
for every man of the house of israel and every stranger among the
proselytes in israel if he separate himself from me and place his
idols in his heart and set the stumblingblock of his iniquity before
his face and come to the prophet to inquire of me by him i the lord
will answer him by myself
and i will set my face against that man and will make him an
example and a proverb and will cut him off from the midst of my
people and you shall know that i am the lord
and when the prophet shall err and speak a word i the lord have
deceived that prophet and i will stretch forth my hand upon him and
will cut him off from the midst of my people israel
of their own heads and according to their own corrupt inclinations
prophets partly by withdrawing his light from them and abandoning them
to their own corrupt inclinations which push them on to prophesy such
things as are agreeable to those who consult them and partly by
disappointing them and causing all thing to happen contrary to what
they have said
and they shall bear their iniquity according to the iniquity of
him that inquireth so shall the iniquity of the prophet be
that the house of israel may go no more astray from me nor be
polluted with all their transgressions but may be my people and i may
be their god saith the lord of hosts
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man when a land shall sin against me so as to transgress
grievously i will stretch forth my hand upon it and will break the
staff of the bread thereof and i will send famine upon it and will
destroy man and beast out of it
and if these three men noe daniel and job shall be in it
they shall deliver their own souls by their justice saith the lord of
hosts
and if i shall bring mischievous beasts also upon the land to
waste it and it be desolate so that there is none that can pass
because of the beasts
if these three men shall be in it as i live saith the lord
they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be
delivered and the land shall be made desolate
or if i bring the sword upon that land and say to the sword
and these three men be in the midst thereof as i live saith the
themselves alone shall be delivered
or if i also send the pestilence upon that land and pour out my
indignation upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast
and noe and daniel and job be in the midst thereof as i live
saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter but
they shall only deliver their own souls by their justice
for thus saith the lord although i shall send in upon jerusalem
my four grievous judgments the sword and the famine and the
mischievous beasts and the pestilence to destroy out of it man and
beast
yet there shall be left in it some that shall be saved who shall
bring away their sons and daughters behold they shall come among you
and you shall see their way and their doings and you shall be
comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem in all
things that i have brought upon it
and they shall comfort you when you shall see their ways and
their doings and you shall know that i have not done without cause all
that i have done in it saith the lord god
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man what shall be made of the wood of the vine out of all
the trees of the woods that are among the trees of the forests
shall wood be taken of it to do any work or shall a pin be made
of it for any vessel to hang thereon
behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire hath consumed
both ends thereof and the midst thereof is reduced to ashes shall it
be useful for any work
even when it was whole it was not fit for work how much less
when the fire hath devoured and consumed it shall any work be made of
it
therefore thus saith the lord god as the vine tree among the
trees of the forests which i have given to the fire to be consumed so
will i deliver up the inhabitants of jerusalem
and i will set my face against them they shall go out from fire
and fire shall consume them and you shall know that i am the lord when
and i shall have made their land a wilderness and desolate
because they have been transgressors saith the lord god
ingratitude and manifold disloyalties but promiseth mercy by a new
covenant
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man make known to jerusalem her abominations
in babylon
and thou shalt say thus saith the lord god to jerusalem thy
root and thy nativity is of the land of chanaan thy father was an
and when thou wast born in the day of thy nativity thy navel was
not cut neither wast thou washed with water for thy health nor salted
with salt nor swaddled with clouts
no eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee out of
compassion to thee but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in
the abjection of thy soul in the day that thou wast born
and passing by thee i saw that thou wast trodden under foot in
thy own blood and i said to thee when thou wast in thy blood live i
have said to thee live in thy blood
i caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thou didst
increase and grow great and advancedst and camest to womans ornament
thy breasts were fashioned and thy hair grew and thou was naked and
full of confusion
and i passed by thee and saw thee and behold thy time was the
time of lovers and i spread my garment over thee and covered thy
ignominy and i swore to thee and i entered into a covenant with thee
saith the lord god and thou becamest mine
and i washed thee with water and cleansed away thy blood from
thee and i anointed thee with oil
and i clothed thee with embroidery and shod thee with violet
coloured shoes and i girded thee about with fine linen and clothed
thee with fine garments
i decked thee also with ornaments and put bracelets on thy
hands and a chain about thy neck
benefits giving you a law with sacrifices sacraments and other holy
rites
and i put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears and
a beautiful crown upon thy head
and thou wast adorned with gold and silver and wast clothed
with fine linen and embroidered work and many colours thou didst eat
fine flour and honey and oil and wast made exceeding beautiful and
wast advanced to be a queen
and thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty for
thou wast perfect through my beauty which i had put upon thee saith
the lord god
but trusting in thy beauty thou playedst the harlot because of
thy renown and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger to be
his
and taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sewed
together on each side and hast played the harlot upon them as hath not
been done before nor shall be hereafter
and thou tookest thy beautiful vessels of my gold and my
silver which i gave thee and thou madest thee images of men and hast
committed fornication with them
and thou tookest thy garments of divers colours and coveredst
them and settest my oil and my sweet incense before them
and my bread which i gave thee the fine flour and oil and
honey wherewith i fed thee thou hast set before them for a sweet
odour and it was done saith the lord god
and thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast
borne to me and hast sacrificed the same to them to be devoured is thy
fornication small
thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them consecrating
them by fire
abominable than the crimes mentioned throughout this chapter so the
infidelities of the israelites in forsaking god and sacrificing even
their children to idols are strongly figured by these allegories
and after all thy abominations and fornications thou hast not
remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and full of
confusion trodden under foot in thy own blood
and it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe to thee
saith the lord god
that thou didst also build thee a common stew and madest thee a
brothel house in every street
at every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy
prostitution and hast made thy beauty to be abominable and hast
prostituted thyself to every one that passed by and hast multiplied thy
fornications
and thou hast committed fornication with the egyptians thy
neighbours men of large bodies and hast multiplied thy fornications to
provoke me
behold i will stretch out my hand upon thee and will take away
thy justification and i will deliver thee up to the will of the
daughters of the philistines that hate thee that are ashamed of thy
wicked way
thou hast also committed fornication with the assyrians because
thou wast not yet satisfied and after thou hadst played the harlot with
them even so thou wast not contented
thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of chanaan
with the chaldeans and neither so wast thou satisfied
wherein shall i cleanse thy heart saith lord god seeing thou
dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute
because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every
way and thou hast made thy high place in every street and wast not as
a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price
but is an adulteress that bringeth in strangers over her
husband
gifts are given to all harlots but thou hast given hire to all
thy lovers and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every
side to commit fornication with thee
and it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in
thy fornications and after thee there shall be no such fornication for
in that thou gavest rewards and didst not take rewards the contrary
hath been done in thee
therefore o harlot hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord god because thy money hath been poured out
and thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers and
with the idols of thy abominations by the blood of thy children whom
thou gavest them
behold i will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou hast
taken pleasure and all whom thou hast loved with all whom thou hast
hated and i will gather them together against thee on every side and
will discover thy shame in their sight and they shall see all thy
nakedness
and i will judge thee as adulteresses and they that shed blood
are judged and i will give thee blood in fury and jealousy
and i will deliver thee into their hands and they shall destroy
thy brothel house and throw down thy stews and they shall strip thee
of thy garments and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty and
leave thee naked and full of disgrace
and they shall bring upon thee a multitude and they shall stone
thee with stones and shall slay thee with their swords
and they shall burn thy houses with fire and shall execute
judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and thou shalt cease
from fornication and shalt give no hire any more
and my indignation shall rest in thee and my jealousy shall
depart from thee and i will cease and be angry no more
because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast
provoked me in all these things wherefore i also have turned all thy
ways upon thy head saith the lord god and i have not done according to
thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations
behold every one that useth a common proverb shall use this
against thee saying as the mother was so also is her daughter
thou art thy mothers daughter that cast off her husband and
her children and thou art the sister of thy sisters who cast off their
husbands and their children your mother was a cethite and your father
an amorrhite
and thy elder sister is samaria she and her daughters that dwell
at thy left hand and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand
is sodom and her daughters
but neither hast thou walked in their ways nor hast thou done a
little less than they according to their wickednesses thou hast done
almost more wicked things than they in all thy ways
as i live saith the lord god thy sister sodom herself and her
daughters have not done as thou hast done and thy daughters
behold this was the iniquity of sodom thy sister pride fulness
of bread and abundance and the idleness of her and of her daughters
and they did not put forth their hand to the needy and the poor
which the sodomites came to fall into those abominations for which they
were destroyed for pride gluttony and idleness are the highroad to
all kinds of lust especially when they are accompanied with a neglect
of the works of mercy
and they were lifted up and committed abominations before me
and i took them away as thou hast seen
and samaria committed not half thy sins but thou hast surpassed
them with thy crimes and hast justified thy sisters by all thy
abominations which thou hast done
therefore do thou also bear thy confusion thou that hast
surpassed thy sisters with thy sins doing more wickedly than they for
they are justified above thee therefore be thou also confounded and
bear thy shame thou that hast justified thy sisters
and i will bring back and restore them by bringing back sodom
with her daughters and by bringing back samaria and her daughters and
out of all nations and of many of the jews to the church of christ
that thou mayest bear thy shame and mayest be confounded in all
that thou hast done comforting them
and thy sister sodom and her daughters shall return to their
ancient state and samaria and her daughters shall return to their
ancient state and thou and thy daughters shall return to your ancient
state
ancient possessions in the spiritual sense to the true liberty and
the happy inheritance of the children of god through faith in christ
and sodom thy sister was not heard of in thy mouth in the day of
thy pride
before thy malice was laid open as it is at this time making
thee a reproach of the daughters of syria and of all the daughters of
thou hast borne thy wickedness and thy disgrace saith the lord
for thus saith the lord god i will deal with thee as thou hast
despised the oath in breaking the covenant
and i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy
youth and i will establish with thee an everlasting covenant
and thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou shalt
receive thy sisters thy elder and thy younger and i will give them to
thee for daughters but not by thy covenant
and i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know
that i am the lord
that thou mayest remember and be confounded and mayest no more
open thy mouth because of thy confusion when i shall be pacified toward
thee for all that thou hast done saith the lord god
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable to the house
of israel
and say thus saith the lord god a large eagle with great wings
longlimbed full of feathers and of variety came to libanus and took
away the marrow of the cedar
cedar king jechonias
he cropped off the top of the twigs thereof and carried it away
into the land of chanaan and he set it in a city of merchants
and he took of the seed of the land and put it in the ground for
seed that it might take a firm root over many waters he planted it on
the surface of the earth
and it sprung up and grew into a spreading vine of low stature
and the branches thereof looked towards him and the roots thereof were
under him so it became a vine and grew into branches and shot forth
sprigs
and there was another large eagle with great wings and many
feathers and behold this vine bending as it were her roots towards
him stretched forth her branches to him that he might water it by the
furrows of her plantation
it was planted in a good ground upon many waters that it might
bring forth branches and bear fruit that it might become a large vine
say thou thus saith the lord god shall it prosper then shall
he not pull up the roots thereof and strip off its fruit and dry up
all the branches it hath shot forth and make it wither and this
without a strong arm or many people to pluck it up by the root
behold it is planted shall it prosper then shall it not be
dried up when the burning wind shall touch it and shall it not wither
in the furrows where it grew
and the word of the lord came to me saying
say to the provoking house know you not what these things mean
take away the king and the princes thereof and carry them with him to
and he shall take one of the kings seed and make a covenant
with him and take an oath of him yea and he shall take away the
mighty men of the land
that it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up but keep his
covenant and observe it
but he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to egypt that
it might give him horses and much people and shall he that hath done
thus prosper or be saved and shall he escape that hath broken the
covenant
as i live saith the lord god in the place where the king
dwelleth that made him king whose oath he hath made void and whose
covenant he broke even in the midst of babylon shall he die
and not with a great army nor with much people shall pharao
fight against him when he shall cast up mounts and build forts to cut
off many souls
for he had despised the oath breaking his covenant and behold
he hath given his hand and having done all these things he shall not
escape
therefore thus saith the lord god as i live i will lay upon his
head the oath he hath despised and the covenant he hath broken
and i will spread my net over him and he shall be taken in my
net and i will bring him into babylon and will judge him there for the
transgression by which he hath despised me
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword
and the residue shall be scattered into every wind and you shall know
that i the lord have spoken
thus saith the lord god i myself will take of the marrow of the
high cedar and will set it i will crop off a tender twig from the top
of the branches thereof and i will plant it on a mountain high and
eminent
mount sion that is the high mountain of his church to which all
nations flow
on the high mountains of israel will i plant it and it shall
shoot forth into branches and shall bear fruit and it shall become a
great cedar and all birds shall dwell under it and every fowl shall
make its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof
and all the trees of the country shall know that i the lord have
brought down the high tree and exalted the low tree and have dried up
the green tree and have caused the dry tree to flourish i the lord
have spoken and have done it
wicked man truly repent he shall be saved and if a just man leave his
justice he shall perish
and the word of the lord came to me saying what is the meaning
that you use among you this parable as a proverb in the land of
children are set on edge
as i live saith the lord god this parable shall be no more to
you a proverb in israel
behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the
soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth the same shall die
and if a man be just and do judgment and justice
and hath not eaten upon the mountains nor lifted up his eyes to
the idols of the house of israel and hath not defiled his neighbours
wife nor come near to a menstruous woman
to idols
and hath not wronged any man but hath restored the pledge to the
debtor hath taken nothing away by violence hath given his bread to the
hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment
hath not lent upon usury nor taken any increase hath withdrawn
his hand from iniquity and hath executed true judgment between man and
man
hath walked in my commandments and kept my judgments to do
truth he is just he shall surely live saith the lord god
called everything that was just truth
and if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and
that hath done some one of these things
though he doth not all these things but that eateth upon the
mountains and that defileth his neighbours wife
that grieveth the needy and the poor that taketh away by
violence that restoreth not the pledge and that lifteth up his eyes to
idols that comitteth abomination
that giveth upon usury and that taketh an increase shall such a
one live he shall not live seeing he hath done all these detestable
things he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him
but if he beget a son who seeing all his fathers sins which
he hath done is afraid and shall not do the like to them
that hath not eaten upon the mountains nor lifted up his eyes to
the idols of the house of israel and hath not defiled his neighbours
wife
and hath not grieved any man nor withholden the pledge nor
taken away with violence but hath given his bread to the hungry and
covered the naked with a garment
that hath turned away his hand from injuring the poor hath not
taken usury and increase but hath executed my judgments and hath
walked in my commandments this man shall not die for the iniquity of
his father but living he shall live
as for his father because he oppressed and offered violence to
his brother and wrought evil in the midst of his people behold he is
dead in his own iniquity
and you say why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his
father verily because the son hath wrought judgment and justice hath
kept all my commandments and done them living he shall live
the soul that sinneth the same shall die the son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father and the father shall not bear the iniquity
of the son the justice of the just shall be upon him and the
wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him
but if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath
committed and keep all my commandments and do judgment and justice
living he shall live and shall not die
i will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done in his
justice which he hath wrought he shall live
is it my will that a sinner should die saith the lord god and
not that he should be converted from his ways and live
but if the just man turn himself away from his justice and do
iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth to
work shall he live all his justices which he hath done shall not be
remembered in the prevarication by which he hath prevaricated and in
his sin which he hath committed in them he shall die
and you have said the way of the lord is not right hear ye
therefore o house of israel is it my way that is not right and are
not rather your ways perverse
for when the just turneth himself away from his justice and
comitteth iniquity he shall die therein in the injustice that he hath
wrought he shall die
and when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness
which he hath wrought and doeth judgment and justice he shall save
his soul alive
because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his
iniquities which he hath wrought he shall surely live and not die
and the children of israel say the way of the lord is not right
perverse
therefore will i judge every man according to his ways o house
of israel saith the lord god be converted and do penance for all your
iniquities and iniquity shall not be your ruin
cast away from you all your transgressions by which you have
transgressed and make to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit and
why will you die o house of israel
for i desire not the death of him that dieth saith the lord god
return ye and live
moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel
and say why did thy mother the lioness lie down among the lions
and bring up her whelps in the midst of young lions
and she brought out one of her whelps and he became a lion and
he learned to catch the prey and to devour men
and the nations heard of him and took him but not without
receiving wounds and they brought him in chains into the land of egypt
but she seeing herself weakened and that her hope was lost took
one of her young lions and set him up for a lion
and he went up and down among the lions and became a lion and he
learned to catch the prey and to devour men
he learned to make widows and to lay waste their cities and the
land became desolate and the fulness thereof by the noise of his
roaring
and the nations came together against him on every side out of the
provinces and they spread their net over him in their wounds he was
taken
and they put him into a cage they brought him in chains to the
king of babylon and they cast him into prison that his voice should no
more be heard upon the mountains of israel
thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the water her
fruit and her branches have grown out of many waters
and she hath strong rods to make sceptres for them that bear
rule and her stature was exalted among the branches and she saw her
height in the multitude of her branches
but she was plucked up in wrath and cast on the ground and the
burning wind dried up her fruit her strong rods are withered and dried
up the fire hath devoured her
and now she is transplanted into the desert in a land not
passable and dry
and a fire is gone out from a rod of her branches which hath
devoured her fruit so that she now hath no strong rod to be a sceptre
of rulers this is a lamentation and it shall be for a lamentation
but by him setteth his benefits before their eyes and their heinous
sins threatening yet greater punishments but still mixed with mercy
and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the
tenth day of the month there came men of the ancients of israel to
inquire of the lord and they sat before me
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man speak to the ancients of israel and say to them thus
saith the lord god are you come to inquire of me as i live i will not
answer you saith the lord god
if thou judgest them if thou judgest o son of man declare to
them the abominations of their fathers
against them
and say to them thus saith the lord god in the day when i chose
appeared to them in the land of egypt and lifted up my hand for them
saying i am the lord your god
in that day i lifted up my hand for them to bring them out of the
land of egypt into a land which i had provided for them flowing with
milk and honey which excelled amongst all lands
and i said to them let every man cast away the scandals of his
eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord
your god
worship of which they were allured by their eyes
but they provoked me and would not hearken to me they did not
every man cast away the abominations of his eyes neither did they
forsake the idols of egypt and i said i would pour out my indignation
upon them and accomplish my wrath against them in the midst of the land
of egypt
but i did otherwise for my names sake that it might not be
violated before the nations in the midst of whom they were and among
whom i made myself known to them to bring them out of the land of
therefore i brought them out from the land of egypt and brought
them into the desert
and i gave them my statutes and i shewed them my judgments
which if a man do he shall live in them
moreover i gave them also my sabbaths to be a sign between me
and them and that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify
them
but the house of israel provoked me in the desert they walked
not in my statutes and they cast away my judgments which if a man do
he shall live in them and they grievously violated my sabbaths i said
therefore that i would pour out my indignation upon them in the desert
and would consume them
but i spared them for the sake of my name lest it should be
profaned before the nations from which i brought them out in their
sight
so i lifted up my hand over them in the desert not to bring them
into the land which i had given them flowing with milk and honey the
best of all lands
because they cast off my judgments and walked not in my
statutes and violated my sabbaths for their heart went after idols
yet my eye spared them so that i destroyed them not neither did
and i said to their children in the wilderness walk not in the
statutes of your fathers and observe not their judgments nor be ye
defiled with their idols
i am the lord your god walk ye in my statutes and observe my
judgments and do them
and sanctify my sabbaths that they may be a sign between me and
you and that you may know that i am the lord your god
but their children provoked me they walked not in my
commandments nor observed my judgments to do them which if a man do
he shall live in them and they violated my sabbaths and i threatened
to pour out my indignation upon them and to accomplish my wrath in them
in the desert
but i turned away my hand and wrought for my names sake that
it might not be violated before the nations out of which i brought them
forth in their sight
again i lifted up my hand upon them in the wilderness to
disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries
because they had not done my judgments and had cast off my
statutes and had violated my sabbaths and their eyes had been after
the idols of their fathers
therefore i also gave them statutes that were not good and
judgments in which they shall not live
their enemies or those imposes upon them by that cruel tyrant the
devil to whose power they were delivered up for their sins
and i polluted them in their own gifts when they offered all
that opened the womb for their offences and they shall know that i am
the lord
punishment of their offences as to pollute themselves with the blood of
all their firstborn whom they offered up to their idols in compliance
with their wicked devices
wherefore speak to the house of israel o son of man and say to
them thus saith the lord god moreover in this also your fathers
blaspheme me when they had despised and contemned me
and i had brought them into the land for which i lifted up my
hand to give it them they saw every high hill and every shady tree
and there they sacrificed their victims and there they presented the
provocation of their offerings and there they set their sweet odours
and poured forth their libations
and i said to them what meaneth the high place to which you go
and the name thereof was called highplace even to this day
wherefore say to the house of israel thus saith the lord god
fornication with their abominations
and you defile yourselves with all your idols unto this day in
the offering of your gifts when you make your children pass through the
fire and shall i answer you o house of israel as i live saith the
neither shall the thought of your mind come to pass by which you
say we will be as the gentiles and as the families of the earth to
worship stocks and stones
as i live saith the lord god i will reign over you with a
strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out
and i will bring you out from the people and i will gather you
out of the countries in which you are scattered i will reign over you
with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured
out
and i will bring you into the wilderness of people and there
will i plead with you face to face
people
as i pleaded against your fathers in the desert of the land of
and i will make you subject to my sceptre and will bring you
into the bands of the covenant
and i will pick out from among you the transgressors and the
wicked and will bring them out of the land where they sojourn and they
shall not enter into the land of israel and you shall know that i am
the lord
and as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord god walk
ye every one after your idols and serve them but if in this also you
hear me not but defile my holy name any more with your gifts and with
your idols
commandment to serve idols but a figure of speech by which god would
have them to understand that if they would walk after their idols they
must not pretend to serve him at the same time for that he would by no
means suffer such a mixture of worship
in my holy mountain in the high mountain of israel saith the
say in the land in which they shall please me and there will i require
your firstfruits and the chief of your tithes with all your
sanctifications
complete must be understood so as to condemn and reject that mixture of
worship which the jews then followed in this verse god promises to the
true israelites especially to those of the christian church that they
shall serve him in another manner in his holy mountain the spiritual
i will accept of you for an odour of sweetness when i shall have
brought you out from the people and shall have gathered you out of the
lands into which you are scattered and i will be sanctified in you in
the sight of the nations
and you shall know that i am the lord when i shall have brought
you into the land of israel into the land for which i lifted up my hand
to give it to your fathers
and there you shall remember your ways and all your wicked
doings with which you have been defiled and you shall be displeased
with yourselves in your own sight for all your wicked deeds which you
committed
and you shall know that i am the lord when i shall have done
well by you for my own names sake and not according to your evil ways
nor according to your wicked deeds o house of israel saith the lord
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man set thy face against the way of the south and drop
towards the south and prophesy against the forest of the south field
prohet then was and is here called the forest of the south field and
is threatened with utter desolation
and say to the south forest hear the word of the lord thus
saith the lord god behold i will kindle a fire in thee and will burn
in thee every green tree and every dry tree the flame of the fire
shall not be quenched and every face shall be burned in it from the
south even to the north
and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindled it and it
shall not be quenched
and i said ah ah ah o lord god they say of me doth not this
man speak by parables
also of the ammonites is forshewn and finally babylon the destroyer of
others shall be destroyed
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man set thy face toward jerusalem and let thy speech flow
towards the holy places and prophesy against the land of israel
and say to the land of israel thus saith the lord god behold i
come against thee and i will draw forth my sword out of its sheath and
will cut off in thee the just and the wicked
and forasmuch as i have cut off in thee the just and the wicked
therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh
from the south even to the north
that all flesh may know that i the lord have drawn my sword out of
its sheath not to be turned back
and thou son of man mourn with the breaking of thy loins and
with bitterness sigh before them
and when they shall say to thee why mournest thou thou shalt
say for that which i hear because it cometh and every heart shall
melt and all hands shall be made feeble and every spirit shall faint
and water shall run down every knee behold it cometh and it shall be
done saith the lord god
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god say the
sword the sword is sharpened and furbished
it is sharpened to kill victims it is furbished that it may
glitter thou removest the sceptre of my son thou hast cut down every
tree
sceptre of israel whom god here calls his son
and i have given it to be furbished that it may be handled this
sword is sharpened and it is furbished that it may be in the hand of
the slayer
cry and howl o son of man for this sword is upon my people it
is upon all the princes of israel that are fled they are delivered up
to the sword with my people strike therefore upon thy thigh
because it is tried and that when it shall overthrow the
sceptre and it shall not be saith the lord god
thou therefore o son of man prophesy and strike thy hands
together and let the sword be doubled and let the sword of the slain
be tripled this is the sword of a great slaughter that maketh them
stand amazed
and languish in heart and that multiplieth ruins in all their
gates i have set the dread of the sharp sword the sword that is
furbished to glitter that is made ready for slaughter
be thou sharpened go to the right hand or to the left which
way soever thou hast a mind to set thy face
and i will clap my hands together and will satisfy my
indignation i the lord have spoken
and the word of the lord came to me saying
and thou son of man set thee two ways for the sword of the king
of babylon to come both shall come forth out of one land and with his
hand he shall draw lots he shall consult at the head of the way of the
city
thou shalt make a way that the sword may come to rabbath of the
children of ammon and to juda unto jerusalem the strong city
for the king of babylon stood in the highway at the head of two
ways seeking divination shuffling arrows he inquired of the idols
and consulted entrails
on his right hand was the divination for jerusalem to set
battering rams to open the mouth in slaughter to lift up the voice in
howling to set engines against the gates to cast up a mount to build
forts
and he shall be in their eyes as one consulting the oracle in
vain and imitating the leisure of sabbaths but he will call to
remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken
therefore thus saith the lord god because you have remembered
your iniquity and have discovered your prevarications and your sins
have appeared in all your devices because i say you have remembered
you shall be taken with the hand
but thou profane wicked prince of israel whose day is come that
hath been appointed in the time of iniquity
oath and was otherwise a wicked prince
thus saith the lord god remove the diadem take off the crown
is it not this that hath exalted the low one and brought down him that
was high
had exalted sedecias from a private state and condition to the sovereign
power as the loss of it had brought down jechonias etc
i will shew it to be iniquity iniquity iniquity but this was
not done till he came to whom judgment belongeth and i will give it
him
crown of juda for the manifold iniquities of the kings but it shall not
be utterly removed till christ come whose right it is and who shall
reign in the spiritual house of jacob that is in his church for
evermore
and thou son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god
concerning the children of ammon and concerning their reproach and
thou shalt say o sword o sword come out of the scabbard to kill be
furbished to destroy and to glitter
over the jews at the time of the destruction of jerusalem
whilst they see vain things in thy regard and they divine lies
to bring thee upon the necks of the wicked that are wounded whose
appointed day is come in the time of iniquity
return into thy sheath i will judge thee in the place wherein
thou wast created in the land of thy nativity
against many nations was shortly to be judged and destroyed at home by
the medes and persians
and i will pour out upon thee my indignation in the fire of my
rage will i blow upon thee and will give thee into the hands of men
that are brutish and contrive thy destruction
thou shalt be fuel for the fire thy blood shall be in the midst
of the land thou shalt be forgotten for i the lord have spoken it
will consume them as dross in his furnace
and the word of the lord came to me saying
and thou son of man dost thou not judge dost thou not judge the
city of blood
and thou shalt shew her all her abominations and shalt say thus
saith the lord god this is the city that sheddeth blood in the midst of
her that her time may come and that hath made idols against herself
to defile herself
thou art become guilty in thy blood which thou hast shed and thou
art defiled in thy idols which thou hast made and thou hast made thy
days to draw near and hast brought on the time of thy years therefore
have i made thee a reproach to the gentiles and a mockery to all
countries
those that are near and those that are far from thee shall
triumph over thee thou filthy one infamous great in destruction
behold the princes of israel every one hath employed his arm in
thee to shed blood
they have abused father and mother in thee they have oppressed
the stranger in the midst of thee they have grieved the fatherless and
widow in thee
thou hast despised my sanctuaries and profaned my sabbaths
slanderers have been in thee to shed blood and they have eaten
upon the mountains in thee they have committed wickedness in the midst
of thee
they have discovered the nakedness of their father in thee they
have humbled the uncleanness of the menstruous woman in thee
and every one hath committed abomination with his neighbours
wife and the fatherinlaw hath wickedly defiled his daughterinlaw
the brother hath oppressed his sister the daughter of his father in
thee
they have taken gifts in thee to shed blood thou hast taken
usury and increase and hast covetously oppressed thy neighbours and
thou hast forgotten me saith the lord god
behold i have clapped my hands at thy covetousness which thou
hast exercised and at the blood that hath been shed in the midst of
thee
shall thy heart endure or shall thy hands prevail in the days
which i will bring upon thee i the lord have spoken and will do it
and i will disperse thee in the nations and will scatter thee
among the countries and i will put an end to thy uncleanness in thee
and i will possess thee in the sight of the gentiles and thou
shalt know that i am the lord
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man the house of israel is become dross to me all these
are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace
they are become the dross of silver
therefore thus saith the lord god because you are all turned
into dross therefore behold i will gather you together in the midst of
as they gather silver and brass and tin and iron and lead in
the midst of the furnace that i may kindle a fire in it to melt it so
will i gather you together in my fury and in my wrath and will take my
rest and i will melt you down
and will gather you together and will burn you in the fire of my
wrath and you shall be melted in the midst thereof
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall you be
in the midst thereof and you shall know that i am the lord when i have
poured out my indignation upon you
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man say to her thou art a land that is unclean and not
rained upon in the day of wrath
there is a conspiracy of prophets in the midst thereof like a
lion that roareth and catcheth the prey they have devoured souls they
have taken riches and hire they have made many widows in the midst
thereof
her priests have despised my law and have defiled my
sanctuaries they have put no difference between holy and profane nor
have distinguished between the polluted and the clean and they have
turned away their eyes from my sabbaths and i was profaned in the midst
of them
her princes in the midst of her are like wolves ravening the
prey to shed blood and to destroy souls and to run after gains through
covetousness
and her prophets have daubed them without tempering the mortar
seeing vain things and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the
the people of the land have used oppression and committed
robbery they afflicted the needy and poor and they oppressed the
stranger by calumny without judgment
and i sought among them for a man that might set up a hedge and
stand in the gap before me in favour of the land that i might not
destroy it and i found none
and i poured out my indignation upon them in the fire of my
wrath i consumed them i have rendered their way upon their own head
saith the lord god
manifold disloyalties of samaria and jerusalem with the punishment of
them both
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man there were two women daughters of one mother
and they committed fornication in egypt in their youth they
committed fornication there were their breasts pressed down and the
teats of their virginity were bruised
and their names were oolla the elder and ooliba her younger
sister and i took them and they bore sons and daughters now for their
names samaria is oolla and jerusalem is ooliba
signifies their own habitation because they separated themselves from
his temple and the kingdom of juda ooliba which signifies his
habitation in her because of his temple among them in jerusalem
and oolla committed fornication against me and doted on her
lovers on the assyrians that came to her
that is said in this chapter of the fornications of israel and juda is
to be understood in a spiritual sense of their disloyalty to the lord
by worshipping strange gods
who were clothed with blue princes and rulers beautiful youths
all horsemen mounted upon horses
and she committed her fornications with those chosen men all sons
of the assyrians and she defiled herself with the uncleanness of all
them on whom she doted
moreover also she did not forsake her fornications which she had
committed in egypt for they also lay with her in her youth and they
bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured out their fornication
upon her
therefore have i delivered her into the hands of her lovers into
the hands of the sons of the assyrians upon whose lust she doted
they discovered her disgrace took away her sons and daughters
and slew her with the sword and they became infamous women and they
executed judgments in her
and when her sister ooliba saw this she was mad with lust more
than she and she carried her fornication beyond the fornication of her
sister
impudently prostituting herself to the children of the assyrians
the princes and rulers that came to her clothed with divers colours
to the horsemen that rode upon horses and to young men all of great
beauty
and i saw that she was defiled and that they both took one way
and she increased her fornications and when she had seen men
painted on the wall the images of the chaldeans set forth in colours
and girded with girdles about their reins and with dyed turbans
on their heads the resemblance of all the captains the likeness of the
sons of babylon and of the land of the chaldeans wherein they were
born
she doted upon them with the lust of her eyes and she sent
messengers to them into chaldea
and when the sons of babylon were come to her to the bed of love
they defiled her with their fornications and she was polluted by them
and her soul was glutted with them
and she discovered her fornications and discovered her disgrace
and my soul was alienated from her as my soul was alienated from her
sister
for she multiplied her fornications remembering the days of her
youth in which she played the harlot in the land of egypt
and she was mad with lust after lying with them whose flesh is as
the flesh of asses and whose issue as the issue of horses
and thou hast renewed the wickedness of thy youth when thy
breasts were pressed in egypt and the paps of thy virginity broken
therefore ooliba thus saith the lord god behold i will raise
up against thee all thy lovers with whom thy soul hath been glutted and
the children of babylon and all the chaldeans the nobles and
the kings and princes all the sons of the assyrians beautiful young
men all the captains and rulers the princes of princes and the
renowned horsemen
and they shall come upon thee well appointed with chariot and
wheel a multitude of people they shall be armed against thee on every
side with breastplate and buckler and helmet and i will set judgment
before them and they shall judge thee by their judgments
and i will set my jealousy against thee which they shall execute
upon thee with fury they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears and what
remains shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thy
daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by fire
and they shall strip thee of thy garments and take away the
instruments of thy glory
and i will put an end to thy wickedness in thee and thy
fornication brought out of the land of egypt neither shalt thou lift up
thy eyes to them nor remember egypt any more
for thus saith the lord god behold i will deliver thee into the
hands of them whom thou hatest into their hands with whom thy soul hath
been glutted
and they shall deal with thee in hatred and they shall take away
all thy labours and shall let thee go naked and full of disgrace and
the disgrace of thy fornication shall be discovered thy wickedness and
thy fornications
they have done these things to thee because thou hast played the
harlot with the nations among which thou wast defiled with their idols
thou hast walked in the way of thy sister and i will give her cup
into thy hand
thus saith the lord god thou shalt drink thy sisters cup deep
and wide thou shalt be had in derision and scorn which containeth very
much
thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup
of grief and sadness with the cup of thy sister samaria
and thou shalt drink it and shalt drink it up even to the dregs
and thou shalt devour the fragments thereof thou shalt rend thy
breasts because i have spoken it saith the lord god
therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast forgotten
me and hast cast me off behind thy back bear thou also thy wickedness
and thy fornications
and the lord spoke to me saying son of man dost thou judge
because they have committed adultery and blood is in their
hands and they have committed fornication with their idols moreover
also their children whom they bore to me they have offered to them to
be devoured
yea and they have done this to me they polluted my sanctuary on
the same day and profaned my sabbaths
and when they sacrificed their children to their idols and went
into my sanctuary the same day to profane it they did these things even
in the midst of my house
they sent for men coming from afar to whom they had sent a
messenger and behold they came for whom thou didst wash thyself and
didst paint thy eyes and wast adorned with womens ornaments
thou sattest on a very fine bed and a table was decked before
thee whereupon thou didst set my incense and my ointment
and there was in her the voice of a multitude rejoicing and to
some that were brought of the multitude of men and that came from the
desert they put bracelets on their hands and beautiful crowns on their
heads
and i said to her that was worn out in her adulteries now will
this woman still continue in her fornication
and they went in to her as to a harlot so went they in unto
they therefore are just men these shall judge them as
adulteresses are judged and as shedders of blood are judged because
they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands
for thus saith the lord god bring a multitude upon them and
deliver them over to tumult and rapine
and let the people stone them with stone and let them be stabbed
with their swords they shall kill their sons and daughters and their
houses they shall burn with fire
and i will take away wickedness out of the land and all women
shall learn not to do according to the wickedness of them
and they shall render your wickedness upon you and you shall
bear the sins of your idols and you shall know that i am the lord god
and the word of the lord came to me in the ninth year in the
tenth month the tenth day of the month saying
son of man write thee the name of this day on which the king of
and thou shalt speak by a figure a parable to the provoking house
and say to them thus saith the lord god set on a pot set it on i
say and put water in it
heap together into it the pieces thereof every good piece the
thigh and the shoulder choice pieces and full of bones
take the fattest of the flock and lay together piles of bones
under it the seething thereof is boiling hot and the bones thereof are
thoroughly sodden in the midst of it
therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to the
pot whose rust is in it and its rust is not gone out of it cast it out
piece by piece there hath no lot fallen upon it
for her blood is in the midst of her she hath shed it upon the
smooth rock she hath not shed it upon the ground that it might be
covered with dust
and that i might bring my indignation upon her and take my
vengeance i have shed her blood upon the smooth rock that it should
not be covered
therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city of
which i will make a great bonfire
heap together the bones which i will burn with fire the flesh
shall be consumed and the whole composition shall be sodden and the
bones shall be consumed
then set it empty upon burning coals that it may be hot and the
brass thereof may be melted and let the filth of it be melted in the
midst thereof and let the rust of it be consumed
great pains have been taken and the great rust thereof is not
gone out not even by fire
thy uncleanness is execrable because i desired to cleanse thee
and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness neither shalt thou be
cleansed before i cause my indignation to rest in thee
i the lord have spoken it shall come to pass and i will do it
according to thy ways and according to thy doings saith the lord
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man behold i take from thee the desire of thy eyes with a
stroke and thou shall not lament nor weep neither shall thy tears run
down
sigh in silence make no mourning for the dead let the tire of
thy head be upon thee and thy shoes on thy feet and cover not thy
face nor eat the meat of mourners
so i spoke to the people in the morning and my wife died in the
evening and i did in the morning as he had commanded me
and the people said to me why dost thou not tell us what these
things mean that thou doest
and i said to them the word of the lord came to me saying
speak to the house of israel thus saith the lord god behold i
will profane my sanctuary the glory of your realm and the thing that
your eyes desire and for which your soul feareth your sons and your
daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword
and you shall do as i have done you shall not cover your faces
nor shall you eat the meat of mourners
you shall have crowns on your heads and shoes on your feet you
shall not lament nor weep but you shall pine away for your iniquities
and every one shall sigh with his brother
and ezechiel shall be unto you for a sign of things to come
according to all that he hath done so shall you do when this shall
come to pass and you shall know that i am the lord god
and thou o son of man behold in the day wherein i will take
away from them their strength and the joy of their glory and the
desire of their eyes upon which their souls rest their sons and their
daughters
in that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee to tell
thee
in that day i say shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath
escaped and thou shalt speak and shalt be silent no more and thou
shalt be unto them for a sign of things to come and you shall know that
for their malice against the israelites
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man set thy face against the children of ammon and thou
shalt prophesy of them
and thou shalt say to the children of ammon hear ye the word of
the lord god thus saith the lord god because thou hast said ha ha
upon my sanctuary because it was profaned and upon the land of israel
because it was laid waste and upon the house of juda because they are
led into captivity
therefore will i deliver thee to the men of the east for an
inheritance and they shall place their sheepcotes in thee and shall
set up their tents in thee they shall eat thy fruits and they shall
drink thy milk
and i will make rabbath a stable for camels and the children of
for thus saith the lord god because thou hast clapped thy hands
and stamped with thy foot and hast rejoiced with all thy heart against
the land of israel
therefore behold i will stretch forth my hand upon thee and will
deliver thee to be the spoil of nations and will cut thee off from
among the people and destroy thee out of the lands and break thee in
pieces and thou shalt know that i am the lord
thus saith the lord god because moab and seir have said behold
the house of juda is like all other nations
therefore behold i will open the shoulder of moab from the cities
from his cities i say and his borders the noble cities of the land of
to the people of the east with the children of ammon and i will
give it them for an inheritance that there may be no more any
remembrance of the children of ammon among the nations
and i will execute judgments in moab and they shall know that i
am the lord
thus saith the lord god because edom hath taken vengeance to
revenge herself of the children of juda and hath greatly offended and
hath sought revenge of them
therefore thus saith the lord god i will stretch forth my hand
upon edom and will take away out of it man and beast and will make it
desolate from the south and they that are in dedan shall fall by the
sword
and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people
and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord god
thus saith the lord god because the philistines have taken
vengeance and have revenged themselves with all their mind destroying
and satisfying old enmities
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will stretch forth my
hand upon the philistines and will kill the killers and will destroy
the remnant of the sea coast
and i will execute great vengeance upon them rebuking them in
fury and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my
vengeance upon them
and it came to pass in the eleventh year the first day of the
month that the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man because tyre hath said of jerusalem aha the gates of
the people are broken she is turned to me i shall be filled now she
is laid waste
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i come against thee o
the sea rise up
and they shall break down the walls of tyre and destroy the
towers thereof and i will scrape her dust from her and make her like a
smooth rock
she shall be a drying place for nets in the midst of the sea
because i have spoken it saith the lord god and she shall be a spoil
to the nations
her daughters also that are in the field shall be slain by the
sword and they shall know that i am the lord
for thus saith the lord god behold i will bring against tyre
horses and chariots and horsemen and companies and much people
thy daughters that are in the field he shall kill with the sword
and he shall compass thee with forts and shall cast up a mount round
about and he shall lift up the buckler against thee
and he shall set engines of war and battering rams against thy
walls and shall destroy thy towers with his arms
by reason of the multitude of his horses their dust shall cover
thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and wheels
and chariots when they shall go in at thy gates as by the entrance of
a city that is destroyed
with the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy streets
thy people he shall kill with the sword and thy famous statues shall
fall to the ground
they shall waste thy riches they shall make a spoil of thy
merchandise and they shall destroy thy walls and pull down thy fine
houses and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in
the midst of the waters
and i will make the multitude of thy songs to cease and the
sound of thy harps shall be heard no more
and i will make thee like a naked rock thou shalt be a drying
place for nets neither shalt thou be built any more for i have spoken
it saith the lord god
thus saith the lord god to tyre shall not the islands shake at
the sound of thy fall and the groans of thy slain when they shall be
killed in the midst of thee
then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their
thrones and take off their robes and cast away their broidered
garments and be clothed with astonishment they shall sit on the
ground and with amazement shall wonder at thy sudden fall
and taking up a lamentation over thee they shall say to thee
strong in the sea with thy inhabitants whom all did dread
now shall the ships be astonished in the day of thy terror and
the islands in the sea shall be troubled because no one cometh out of
thee
for thus saith the lord god when i shall make thee a desolate
city like the cities that are not inhabited and shall bring the deep
upon thee and many waters shall cover thee
and when i shall bring thee down with those that descend into the
pit to the everlasting people and shall set thee in the lowest parts of
the earth as places desolate of old with them that are brought down
into the pit that thou be not inhabited and when i shall give glory in
the land of the living
i will bring thee to nothing and thou shalt not be and if thou
be sought for thou shalt not be found any more for ever saith the lord
fall
and the word of the lord came to me saying

and say to tyre that dwelleth at the entry of the sea being the
mart of the people for many islands thus saith the lord god o tyre

and they shall mourn over thee with a loud voice and shall cry
bitterly and they shall cast up dust upon their heads and shall be

son of man say to the prince of tyre thus saith the lord god
in the chair of god in the heart of the sea whereas thou art a man and
not god and hast set thy heart as if it were the heart of god
behold thou art wiser than daniel no secret is hid from thee
amongst the chaldeans when any one would express an extraordinary
wisdom to say he was as wise as daniel
in thy wisdom and thy understanding thou hast made thyself strong
and hast gotten gold an silver into thy treasures
by the greatness of thy wisdom and by thy traffic thou hast
increased thy strength and thy heart is lifted up with thy strength
therefore thus saith the lord god because thy heart is lifted up
as the heart of god
therefore behold i will bring upon thee strangers the strongest
of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of
thy wisdom and they shall defile thy beauty
they shall kill thee and bring thee down and thou shalt die the
death of them that are slain in the heart of the sea
wilt thou yet say before them that slay thee i am god whereas
thou art a man and not god in the hand of them that slay thee
thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of
strangers for i have spoken it saith the lord god
and the word of the lord came to me saying son of man take up
a lamentation upon the king of tyre
and say to him thus saith the lord god thou wast the seal of
resemblance full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
and his natural perfections bore in himself a certain resemblance to
over all the children of pride
thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of god every precious
stone was thy covering the sardius the topaz and the jasper the
chrysolite and the onyx and the beryl the sapphire and the
carbuncle and the emerald gold the work of thy beauty and thy pipes
were prepared in the day that thou wast created
thou a cherub stretched out and protecting and i set thee in
the holy mountain of god thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of
fire
the figure of the cherubims in the sanctuary which with stretched out
wings covered the arkibid the stones of fire that is bright and
precious stones which sparkle like fire
thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation until
iniquity was found in thee
by the multitude of thy merchandise thy inner parts were filled
with iniquity and thou hast sinned and i cast thee out from the
mountain of god and destroyed thee o covering cherub out of the midst
of the stones of fire
and thy heart was lifted up with thy beauty thou hast lost thy
wisdom in thy beauty i have cast thee to the ground i have set thee
before the face of kings that they might behold thee
thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy
iniquities and by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore i will bring
forth a fire from the midst of thee to devour thee and i will make
thee as ashes upon the earth in the sight of all that see thee
all that shall see thee among the nations shall be astonished at
thee thou art brought to nothing and thou shalt never be any more
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man set thy face against sidon and thou shalt prophesy
of it
and shalt say thus saith the lord god behold i come against
thee sidon and i will be glorified in the midst of thee and they
shall know that i am the lord when i shall execute judgments in her
and shall be sanctified in her
and i will send into her pestilence and blood in her streets
and they shall fall being slain by the sword on all sides in the midst
thereof and they shall know that i am the lord
and the house of israel shall have no more a stumblingblock of
bitterness nor a thorn causing pain on every side round about them of
them that are against them and they shall know that i am the lord god
thus saith the lord god when i shall have gathered together the
house of israel out of the people among whom they are scattered i will
be sanctified in them before the gentiles and they shall dwell in their
own land which i gave to my servant jacob
and they shall dwell therein secure and they shall build houses
and shall plant vineyards and shall dwell with confidence when i shall
have executed judgments upon all that are their enemies round about and
they shall know that i am the lord their god
be given to nabuchodonosor for his service against tyre
in the tenth year the tenth month the eleventh day of the month
the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man set thy face against pharao king of egypt and thou
shalt prophesy of him and of all egypt
speak and say thus saith the lord god behold i come against
thee pharao king of egypt thou great dragon that liest in the midst of
thy rivers and sayest the river is mine and i made myself
but i will put a bridle in thy jaws and i will cause the fish of
thy rivers to stick to thy scales and i will draw thee out of the midst
of thy rivers and all thy fish shall stick to thy scales
and i will cast thee forth into the desert and all the fish of
thy river thou shalt fall upon the face of the earth thou shalt not be
taken up nor gathered together i have given thee for meat to the
beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the air
and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am the lord
because thou hast been a staff of a reed to the house of israel
when they took hold of thee with the hand thou didst break and
rent all their shoulder and when they leaned upon thee thou brokest
and weakenest all their loins
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will bring the sword
upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee
and the land of egypt shall become a desert and a wilderness and
they shall know that i am the lord because thou hast said the river is
mine and i made it
therefore behold i come against thee and thy rivers and i will
make the land of egypt utterly desolate and wasted by the sword from
the tower of syene even to the borders of ethiopia
the foot of man shall not pass through it neither shall the foot
of beasts go through it nor shall it be inhabited during forty years
and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the
lands that are desolate and the cities thereof in the midst of the
cites that are destroyed and they shall be desolate for forty years
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse
them through the countries
for thus saith the lord god at the end of forty years i will
gather the egyptians from the people among whom they had been scattered
and i will bring back the captivity of egypt and will place them
in the land of phatures in the land of their nativity and they shall
be there a low kingdom
it shall be the lowest among other kingdoms and it shall no more
be exalted over the nations and i will diminish them that they shall
rule no more over the nations
and they shall be no more a confidence to the house of israel
teaching iniquity that they may flee and follow them and they shall
know that i am the lord god
and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first
month in the first of the month that the word of the lord came to me
saying
son of man nabuchodonosor king of babylon hath made his army to
undergo hard service against tyre every head was made bald and every
shoulder was peeled and there hath been no reward given him nor his
army for tyre for the service that he rendered me against it
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will set
take her multitude and take the booty thereof for a prey and rifle the
spoils thereof and it shall be wages for his army
and for the service that he hath done me against it i have given
him the land of egypt because he hath laboured for me saith the lord
in that day a horn shall bud forth to the house of israel and i
will give thee an open mouth in the midst of them and they shall know
that i am the lord
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god howl ye
for the day is near yea the day of the lord is near a cloudy
day it shall be the time of the nations
and the sword shall come upon egypt and there shall be dread in
thereof shall be taken away and the foundations thereof shall be
destroyed
ethiopia and libya and lydia and all the rest of the crowd and
by the sword
thus saith the lord god they also that uphold egypt shall fall
and the pride of her empire shall be brought down from the tower of
hosts
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the lands that are
desolate and the cities thereof shall be in the midst of the cities
that are wasted
and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall have set a
fire in egypt and all the helpers thereof shall be destroyed
in that day shall messengers go forth from my face in ships to
destroy the confidence of ethiopia and there shall be dread among them
in the day of egypt because it shall certainly come
thus saith the lord god i will make the multitude of egypt to
cease by the hand of nabuchodonosor the king of babylon
he and his people with him the strongest of nations shall be
brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords upon
and i will make the channels of the rivers dry and will deliver
the land into the hand of the wicked and will lay waste the land and
all that is therein by the hands of strangers i the lord have spoken
it
thus saith the lord god i will also destroy the idols and i
will make an end of the idols of memphis and there shall be no more a
prince of the land of egypt and i will cause a terror in the land of
and i will destroy the land of phatures and will make a fire in
city which was afterwards rebuilt by alexander the great and from his
name called alexandria
and i will pour out my indignation upon pelusium the strength of
and i will make a fire in egypt pelusium shall be in pain like a
woman in labour and alexandria shall be laid waste and in memphis
there shall be daily distresses
the young men of heliopolis and of bubastus shall fall by the
sword and they themselves shall go into captivity
and in taphnis the day shall be darkened when i shall break
there the sceptres of egypt and the pride of her power shall cease in
her a cloud shall cover her and her daughters shall be led into
captivity
and i will execute judgments in egypt and they shall know that i
am the lord
and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month in
the seventh day of the month that the word of the lord came me
saying
son of man i have broken the arm of pharao king of egypt and
behold it is not bound up to be healed to be tied up with clothes and
swathed with linen that it might recover strength and hold the sword
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i come against pharao
king of egypt and i will break into pieces his strong arm which is
already broken and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand
and i will disperse egypt among the nations and scatter them
through the countries
and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and will
put my sword in his hand and i will break the arms of pharao and they
shall groan bitterly being slain before his face
and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and the
arms of pharao shall fall and they shall know that i am the lord when
shall have stretched it forth upon the land of egypt
and i will disperse egypt among the nations and will scatter
them through the countries and they shall know that i am the lord
like manner
and it came to pass in the eleventh year the third month the
first day of the month that the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man speak to pharao king of egypt and to his people to
whom art thou like in thy greatness
behold the assyrian like a cedar in libanus with fair branches
and full of leaves of a high stature and his top was elevated among
the thick boughs
the waters nourished him the deep set him tip on high the
streams thereof ran round about his roots and it sent forth its
rivulets to all the trees of the country
therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the
country and his branches were multiplied and his boughs were elevated
because of many waters
and when he had spread forth his shadow all the fowls of the air
made their nests in his boughs and all the beasts of the forest brought
forth their young under his branches and the assembly of many nations
dwelt under his shadow
and he was most beautiful for his greatness and for the spreading
of his branches for his root was near great waters
the cedars in the paradise of god were not higher than he the fir
trees did not equal his top neither were the planetrees to be compared
with him for branches no tree in the paradise of god was like him in
his beauty
for i made him beautiful and thick set with many branches and all
the trees of pleasure that were in the paradise of god envied him
therefore thus saith the lord god because he was exalted in
height and shot up his top green and thick and his heart was lifted up
in his height
i have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the
nations he shall deal with him i have cast him out according to his
wickedness
conquered both the assyrians and egyptians
and strangers and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him
down and cast him away upon the mountains and his boughs shall fall in
every valley and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the
country and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow
and leave him
all the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins and all the beasts
of the field were among his branches
for which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt
themselves for their height nor shoot up their tops among the thick
branches and leaves neither shall any of them that are watered stand up
in their height for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest
parts of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that
go down into the pit
thus saith the lord god in the day when he went down to hell i
brought in mourning i covered him with the deep and i withheld its
rivers and restrained the many waters libanus grieved for him and all
the trees of the field trembled
i shook the nations with the sound of his fall when i brought
him down to hell with them that descend into the pit and all the trees
of pleasure the choice and best in libanus all that were moistened
with waters were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth
for they also shall go down with him to hell to them that are
slain by the sword and the arm of every one shall sit down under his
shadow in the midst of the nations
to whom art thou like o thou that art famous and lofty among the
trees of pleasure behold thou art brought down with the trees of
pleasure to the lowest parts of the earth thou shalt sleep in the midst
of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword this is
and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in
the first day of the month that the word of the lord came to me
saying
son of man take up a lamentation for pharao the king of egypt
and say to him thou art like the lion of the nations and the dragon
that is in the sea and thou didst push with the horn in thy rivers and
didst trouble the waters with thy feet and didst trample upon their
streams
therefore thus saith the lord god i will spread out my net over
thee with the multitude of many people and i will draw thee up in my
net
and i will throw thee out on the land i will cast thee away into
the open field and i will cause all the fowls of the air to dwell upon
thee and i will fill the beasts of all the earth with thee
and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and will fill thy
hills with thy corruption
and i will water the earth with thy stinking blood upon the
mountains and the valleys shall be filled with thee
and i will cover the heavens when thou shalt be put out and i
will make the stars thereof dark i will cover the sun with a cloud and
the moon shall not give her light
i will make all the lights of heaven to mourn over thee and i will
cause darkness upon thy land saith the lord god when thy wounded shall
fall in the midst of the land saith the lord god
and i shall provoke to anger the heart of many people when i
shall have brought in thy destruction among the nations upon the lands
which thou knowest not
and i will make many people to be amazed at thee and their kings
shall be horribly afraid for thee when my sword shall begin to fly upon
their faces and they shall be astonished on a sudden every one for his
own life in the day of their ruin
for thus saith the lord god the sword of the king of babylon
shall come upon thee
by the swords of the mighty i will overthrow thy multitude all
these nations are invincible and they shall waste the pride of egypt
and the multitude thereof shall be destroyed
i will destroy also all the beasts thereof that were beside the
great waters and the foot of man shall trouble them no more neither
shall the hoof of beasts trouble them
then will i make their waters clear and cause their rivers to
run like oil saith the lord god
when i shall have made the land of egypt desolate and the land
shall be destitute of her fulness when i shall have struck all the
inhabitants thereof and they shall know that i am the lord
this is the lamentation and they shall lament therewith the
daughters of the nations shall lament therewith for egypt and for the
multitude thereof they shall lament therewith saith the lord god
and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the fifteenth day of
the month that the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man sing a mournful song for the multitude of egypt and
cast her down both her and the daughters of the mighty nations to the
lowest part of the earth with them that go down into the pit
whom dost thou excel in beauty go down and sleep with the
uncircumcised
they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain with the
sword the sword is given they have drawn her down and all her people
the most mighty among the strong ones shall speak to him from the
midst of hell they that went down with his helpers and slept
uncircumcised slain by the sword
assur is there and all his multitude their graves are round
about him all of them slain and that fell by the sword
whose graves are set in the lowest parts of the pit and his
multitude lay round about his grave all of them slain and fallen by
the sword they that heretofore spread terror in the land of the living
there is elam and all his multitude round about his grave all of
them slain and fallen by the sword that went down uncircumcised to the
lowest parts of the earth that caused their terror in the land of the
living and they have borne their shame with them that go down into the
pit
in the midst of the slain they have set him a bed among all his
people their graves are round about him all these are uncircumcised
and slain by the sword for they spread their terror in the land of the
living and have borne their shame with them that descend into the pit
they are laid in the midst of the slain
there is mosoch and thubal and all their multitude their
graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised and slain and
fallen by the sword though they spread their terror in the land of the
living
and they shall not sleep with the brave and with them that fell
uncircumcised that went down to hell with their weapons and laid their
swords under their heads and their iniquities were in their bones
because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living
so thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised
and shalt sleep with them that are slain by the sword
there is edom and her kings and all her princes who with their
army are joined with them that are slain by the sword and have slept
with the uncircumcised and with them that go down into the pit
there are all the princes of the north and all the hunters who
were brought down with the slain fearing and confounded in their
strength who slept uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword
and have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit
pharao saw them and he was comforted concerning all his
multitude which was slain by the sword pharao and all his army saith
the lord god
because i have spread my terror in the land of the living and he
hath slept in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by
the sword pharao and all his multitude saith the lord god
his judgments upon the jews
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man speak to the children of thy people and say to them
man one of their meanest and make him a watchman over them
and he sees the sword coming upon the land and sound the trumpet
and tell the people
then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet whosoever he be
and doth not look to himself if the sword come and cut him off his
blood shall be upon his own head
he heard the sound of the trumpet and did not look to himself
his blood shall be upon him but if he look to himself he shall save
his life
and if the watchman see the sword coming and sound not the
trumpet and the people look not to themselves and the sword come and
cut off a soul from among them he indeed is taken away in his iniquity
but i will require his blood at the hand of the watchman
so thou o son of man i have made thee a watchman to the house of
it them from me
when i say to the wicked o wicked man thou shalt surely die if
thou dost not speak to warn the wicked man from his way that wicked man
shall die in his iniquity but i will require his blood at thy hand
but if thou tell the wicked man that he may be converted from his
ways and he be not converted from his way he shall die in his iniquity
but thou hast delivered thy soul
thou therefore o son of man say to the house of israel thus
you have spoken saying our iniquities and our sins are upon us and
we pine away in them how then can we live
say to them as i live saith the lord god i desire not the
death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live
thou therefore o son of man say to the children of thy people
shall sin and the wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him in what
day soever he shall turn from his wickedness and the just shall not be
able to live in his justice in what day soever he shall sin
yea if i shall say to the just that he shall surely live and
he trusting in his justice commit iniquity all his justices shall be
forgotten and his iniquity which he hath committed in the same shall
he die
and it i shall say to the wicked thou shalt surely die and he
do penance for his sin and do judgment and justice
and if that wicked man restore the pledge and render what he had
robbed and walk in the commandments of life and do no unjust thing he
shall surely live and shall not die
none of his sins which he hath committed shall be imputed to
him he hath done judgment and justice he shall surely live
and the children of thy people have said the way of the lord is
not equitable whereas their own way is unjust
for when the just shall depart from his justice and commit
iniquities he shall die in them
and when the wicked shall depart from his wickedness and shall
do judgments and justice he shall live in them
and you say the way of the lord is not right i will judge every
one of you according to his ways o house of israel
and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the
tenth month in the fifth day of the month that there came to me one
that was fled from jerusalem saying the city is laid waste
and the hand of the lord had been upon me in the evening before
he that was fled came and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the
morning and my mouth being opened i was silent no more
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man they that dwell in these ruinous places in the land
of israel speak saying abraham was one and he inherited the land
but we are many the land is given us in possession
therefore say to them thus saith the lord god you that eat with
the blood and lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses and that shed
blood shall you possess the land by inheritance
you stood on your swords you have committed abominations and
every one hath defiled his neighbours wife and shall you possess the
land by inheritance
say thou thus to them thus saith the lord god as i live they
that dwell in the ruinous places shall fall by the sword and he that
is in the field shall be given to the beasts to be devoured and they
that are in holds and caves shall die of the pestilence
and i will make the land a wilderness and a desert and the
proud strength thereof shall fail and the mountains of israel shall be
desolate because there is none to pass by them
and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall have made
their land waste and desolate for all their abominations which they
have committed
and thou son of man the children of thy people that talk of
thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to
another each man to his neighbour saying come and let us hear what is
the word that cometh forth from the lord
and they come to thee as if people were coming in and my people
sit before thee and hear thy words and do them not for they turn them
into a song of their mouth and their heart goeth after their
covetousness
and thou art to them as a musical song which is sung with a sweet
and agreeable voice and they hear thy words and do them not
and when that which was foretold shall come to pass for behold
it is coming then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them
together his flock from all parts of the earth and preserve it for
ever
and the word of the lord came to me it saying
son of man prophesy concerning the shepherds of israel prophesy
and say to the shepherds thus saith the lord god woe to the shepherds
of israel that fed themselves should not the flocks be fed by the
shepherds
you ate the milk and you clothed yourselves with the wool and
you killed that which was fat but my flock you did not feed
the weak you have not strengthened and that which was sick you
have not healed that which was broken you have not bound up and that
which was driven away you have not brought again neither have you
sought that which was lost but you ruled over them with rigour and
with a high hand
and my sheep were scattered because there was no shepherd and
they became the prey of all the beasts of the field and were scattered
my sheep have wandered in every mountain and in every high hill
and my flocks were scattered upon the face of the earth and there was
none that sought them there was none i say that sought them
therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord
as i live saith the lord god forasmuch as my flocks have been
made a spoil and my sheep are become a prey to all the beasts of the
field because there was no shepherd for my shepherds did not seek
after my flock but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flocks
therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord god behold i myself come upon the shepherds
from feeding the flock any more neither shall the shepherds feed
themselves any more and i will deliver my flock from their mouth and
it shall no more be meat for them
for thus saith the lord god behold i myself will seek my sheep
and will visit them
as the shepherd visiteth his flock in the day when he shall be in
the midst of his sheep that were scattered so will i visit my sheep
and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been
scattered in the cloudy and dark day
and i will bring them out from the peoples and will gather them
out of the countries and will bring them to their own land and i will
feed them in the mountains of israel by the rivers and in all the
habitations of the land
i will feed them in the most fruitful pastures and their
pastures shall be in the high mountains of israel there shall they rest
on the green grass and be fed in fat pastures upon the mountains of
i will feed my sheep and i will cause them to lie down saith
the lord god
i will seek that which was lost and that which was driven away
strengthen that which was weak and that which was fat and strong i will
preserve and i will feed them in judgment
and as for you o my flocks thus saith the lord god behold i
judge between cattle and cattle of rams and of hegoats
was it not enough for you to feed upon good pastures but you
must also tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures and
when you drank the clearest water you troubled the rest with your feet
and my sheep were fed with that which you had trodden with your
feet and they drank what your feet had troubled
therefore thus saith the lord god to you behold i myself will
judge between the fat cattle and the lean
because you thrusted with sides and shoulders and struck all the
weak cattle with your horns till they were scattered abroad
i will save my flock and it shall be no more a spoil and i will
judge between cattle and cattle
and i will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed them
even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be their
shepherd
and i the lord will be their god and my servant david the prince
in the midst of them i the lord have spoken it
and i will make a covenant of peace with them and will cause the
evil beasts to cease out of the land and they that dwell in the
wilderness shall sleep secure in the forests
and i will make them a blessing round about my hill and i will
send down the rain in its season there shall be showers of blessing
and the tree of the field shall yield its fruit and the earth
shall yield her increase and they shall be in their land without fear
and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall have broken the
bonds of their yoke and shall have delivered them out of the hand of
those that rule over them
and they shall be no more for a spoil to the nations neither
shall the beasts of the earth devour them but they shall dwell securely
without any terror
and i will raise up for them a bud of renown and they shall be
no more consumed with famine in the land neither shall they bear any
more the reproach of the gentiles
illustrious bud of the house of david renowned over all the earth see
and they shall know that i the lord their god am with them and
that they are my people the house of israel saith the lord god
and you my flocks the flocks of my pasture are men and i am the
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man set thy face against mount seir and prophesy
concerning it and say to it
thus saith the lord god behold i come against thee mount seir
and i will stretch forth my hand upon thee and i will make thee
desolate and waste
i will destroy thy cities and thou shalt be desolate and thou
shalt know that i am the lord
because thou hast been an everlasting enemy and hast shut up the
children of israel in the hands of the sword in the time of their
affliction in the time of their last iniquity
therefore as i live saith the lord god i will deliver thee up to
blood and blood shall pursue thee and whereas thou hast hated blood
blood shall pursue thee
and i will make mount seir waste and desolate and i will take
away from it him that goeth and him that returneth
and i will fill his mountains with his men that are slain in thy
hills and in thy valleys and in thy torrents they shall fall that are
slain with the sword
i will make thee everlasting desolations and thy cities shall not
be inhabited and thou shalt know that i am the lord god
because thou hast said the two nations and the two lands shall
be mine and i will possess them by inheritance whereas the lord was
there
therefore as i live saith the lord god i will do according to
thy wrath and according to thy envy which thou hast exercised in
hatred to them and i will be made known by them when i shall have
judged thee
and thou shalt know that i the lord have heard all thy
reproaches that thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel
saying they are desolate they are given to us to consume
and you rose up against me with your mouth and have derogated
from me by your words i have heard them
thus saith the lord god when the whole earth shall rejoice i
will make thee a wilderness
as thou hast rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of
laid waste o mount seir and all idumea and they shall know that i am
the lord
grace christs baptism
and thou son of man prophesy to the mountains of israel and say
thus saith the lord god because the enemy hath said to you aha
the everlasting heights are given to us for an inheritance
therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord god because you
have been desolate and trodden under foot on every side and made an
inheritance to the rest of the nations and are become the subject of
the talk and the reproach of the people
therefore ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god
brooks and to the valleys and to desolate places and ruinous walls
and to the cities that are forsaken that are spoiled and derided by
the rest of the nations round about
therefore thus saith the lord god in the fire of my zeal i have
spoken of the rest of the nations and of all edom who have taken my
land to themselves for an inheritance with joy and with all the heart
and with the mind and have cast it out to lay it waste
prophesy therefore concerning the land of israel and say to the
mountains and to the hills to the ridges and to the valleys thus
saith the lord god behold i have spoken in my zeal and in my
indignation because you have borne the shame of the gentiles
therefore thus saith the lord god i have lifted up my hand that
the gentiles who are round about you shall themselves bear their shame
but as for you o mountains of israel shoot ye forth your
branches and yield your fruit to my people of israel for they are at
hand to come
for i i am for you and i will turn to you and you shall be
ploughed and sown
and i will multiply men upon you and all the house of israel
and the cities ball be inhabited and the ruinous places shall be
repaired
and i will make you abound with men and with beasts and they
shall be multiplied and increased and i will settle you as from the
beginning and will give you greater gifts than you had from the
beginning and you shall know that i am the lord
and i will bring men upon you my people israel and they shall
possess thee for their inheritance and thou shalt be their inheritance
and shalt no more henceforth be without them
thus saith the lord god because thy say of you thou art a
devourer of men and one that suffocatest thy nation
therefore thou shalt devour men no more nor destroy thy nation
any more saith the lord god
neither will i cause men to hear in thee the shame of the nations
any more nor shalt thou bear the reproach of the people nor lose thy
nation any more saith the lord god
to the church of christ and gods perpetual protection of her for as
to the carnal jews they have been removed out of their land these
sixteen hundred years
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man when the house of israel dwelt in their own land
they defiled it with their ways and with their doings their way was
before me like the uncleanness of a menstruous woman
and i poured out my indignation upon them for the blood which
they had shed upon the land and with their idols they defiled it
and i scattered them among the nations and they are dispersed
through the countries i have judged them according to their ways and
their devices
and when they entered among the nations whither they went they
profaned my holy name when it was said of them this is the people of
the lord and they are come forth out of his land
and i have regarded my own holy name which the house of israel
hath profaned among the nations to which they went in
therefore thou shalt say to the house of israel thus saith the
nations whither you went
and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the
shall be sanctified in you before their eyes
for i will take you from among the gentiles and will gather you
together out of all the countries and will bring you into your own
land
and i will pour upon you clean water and you shall be cleansed
from all your filthiness and i will cleanse you from all your idols
and i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you
and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and will give
you a heart of flesh
and i will put my spirit in the midst of you and i will cause
you to walk in my commandments and to keep my judgments and do them
and you shall dwell in the land which i gave to your fathers and
you shall be my people and i will be your god
and i will save you from all your uncleannesses and i will call
for corn and will multiply it and will lay no famine upon you
and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of
the field that you bear no more the reproach of famine among the
nations
and you shall remember your wicked ways and your doings that
were not good and your iniquities and your wicked deeds shall
displease you
it is not for your sakes that i will do this saith the lord god
be it known to you be confounded and ashamed at your own ways o house
of israel
thus saith the lord god in the day that i shall cleanse you from
all your iniquities and shall cause the cities to be inhabited and
shall repair the ruinous places
and the desolate land shall be tilled which before was waste in
the sight of all that passed by
they shall say this land that was untilled is become as a garden
of pleasure and the cities that were abandoned and desolate and
destroyed are peopled and fenced
and the nations that shall be left round about you shall know
that i the lord have built up what was destroyed and planted what was
desolate that i the lord have spoken and done it
thus saith the lord god moreover in this shall the house of
flock of men
as a holy flock as the flock of jerusalem in her solemn feasts
so shall the waste cities be full of flocks of men and they shall know
that i am the lord
of the people from their captivity juda and israel shall be all one
kingdom under christ gods everlasting covenant with the church
the hand of the lord was upon me and brought me forth in the
spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of a plain that was
full of bones
and he led me about through them on every side now they were very
many upon the face of the plain and they were exceeding dry
and he said to me son of man dost thou think these bones shall
live and i answered o lord god thou knowest
and he said to me prophesy concerning these bones and say to
them ye dry bones hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord god to these bones behold i will send spirit
into you and you shall live
and i will lay sinews upon you and will cause flesh to grow over
you and will cover you with skin and i will give you spirit and you
shall live and you shall know that i am the lord
and i prophesied as he had commanded me and as i prophesied there
was a noise and behold a commotion and the bones came together each
one its joint
and i saw and behold the sinews and the flesh came up upon them
and the skin was stretched out over them but there was no spirit in
them
and he said to me prophesy to the spirit prophesy o son of man
and say to the spirit thus saith the lord god come spirit from the
four winds and blow upon these slain and let them live again
and i prophesied as he had commanded me and the spirit came into
them and they lived and they stood up upon their feet an exceeding
great army
and he said to me son of man all these bones are the house of
are cut off
therefore prophesy and say to them thus saith the lord god
sepulchres o my people and will bring you into the land of israel
and you shall know that i am the lord when i shall have opened
your sepulchres and shall have brought you out of your graves o my
people
and shall have put my spirit in you and you shall live and i
shall make you rest upon your own land and you shall know that i the
and the word of the lord came to me saying
and thou son of man take thee a stick and write upon it of
stick and write upon it for joseph the stick of ephraim and for all
the house of israel and of his associates
and join them one to the other into one stick and they shall
become one in thy hand
and when the children of thy people shall speak to thee saying
say to them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the
stick of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of
the stick of juda and will make them one stick and they shall be one
in his hand
and the sticks whereon thou hast written shall be in thy hand
before their eyes
and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord god behold i
will take of the children of israel from the midst of the nations
whither they are gone and i will gather them on every side and will
bring them to their own land
and i will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of
be two nations neither shall they be divided any more into two
kingdoms
nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols nor with
their abominations nor with all their iniquities and i will save them
out of all the places in which they have sinned and i will cleanse
them and they shall be my people and i will be their god
and my servant david shall be king over them and they shall have
one shepherd they shall walk in my judgments and shall keep my
commandments and shall do them
and they shall dwell in the land which i gave to my servant
their children and their childrens children for ever and david my
servant shall be their prince for ever
and i will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an
everlasting covenant with them and i will establish them and will
multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever
and my tabernacle shall be with them and i will be their god
and they shall be my people
and the nations shall know that i am the lord the sanctifier of
overthrown
and the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man set thy face against gog the land of magog the chief
prince of mosoch and thubal and prophesy of him
place either for the persecutors of the church of god in general or
some archpersecutor in particular such as antichrist shall be in the
latter days see apoc and what is said of the punishment of gog
is verified by the unhappy ends of persecutorsibid magog scythia
or tartary from whence the turks and other enemies of the church of
and say to him thus saith the lord god behold i come against
thee o gog the chief prince of mosoch and thubal
and i will turn thee about and i will put a bit in thy jaws and
clothed with coats of mail a great multitude armed with spears and
shields and swords
the persians ethiopians and libyans with them all with shields
and helmets
gomer and all his bands the house of thogorma the northern
parts and all his strength and many peoples with thee
prepare and make thyself ready and all thy multitude that is
assembled about thee and be thou commander over them
after many days thou shalt be visited at the end of years thou
shalt come to the land that is returned from the sword and is gathered
out of many nations to the mountains of israel which have been
continually waste but it hath been brought forth out of the nations
and they shall all of them dwell securely in it
and thou shalt go up and come like a storm and like a cloud to
cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with thee
thus saith the lord god in that day projects shall enter into
thy heart and thou shalt conceive a mischievous design
and thou shalt say i will go up to the land which is without a
wall i will come to them that are at rest and dwell securely all
these dwell without a wall they have no bars nor gates
to take spoils and lay hold on the prey to lay thy hand upon
them that had been wasted and afterwards restored and upon the people
that is gathered together out of the nations which hath begun to
possess and to dwell in the midst of the earth
saba and dedan and the merchants of tharsis and all the lions
thereof shall say to thee art thou come to take spoils behold thou
hast gathered thy multitude to take a prey to take silver and gold
and to carry away goods and substance and to take rich spoils
therefore thou son of man prophesy and say to gog thus saith
the lord god shalt thou not know in that day when my people of israel
shall dwell securely
and thou shalt come out of thy place from the northern parts
thou and many people with thee all of them riding upon horses a great
company and a mighty army
and thou shalt come upon my people of israel like a cloud to
cover the earth thou shalt be in the latter days and i will bring thee
upon my land that the nations may know me when i shall be sanctified
in thee o gog before their eyes
thus saith the lord god thou then art he of whom i have spoken
in the days of old by my servants the prophets of israel who
prophesied in the days of those times that i would bring thee upon them
and it shall come to pass in that day in the day of the coming
of gog upon the land of israel saith the lord god that my indignation
shall come up in my wrath
and i have spoken in my zeal and in the fire of my anger that
in that day there shall be a great commotion upon the land of israel
so that the fishes of the sea and the birds of the air and the
beasts of the field and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
ground and all men that are upon the face of the earth shall be moved
at my presence and the mountains shall be thrown down and the hedges
shall fall and every wall shall fall to the ground
and i will call in the sword against him in all my mountains
saith the lord god every mans sword shall be pointed against his
brother
and i will judge him with pestilence and with blood and with
violent rain and vast hailstones i will rain fire and brimstone upon
him and upon his army and upon the many nations that are with him
and i will be magnified and i will be sanctified and i will be
known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that i am the
shall be favoured with everlasting kindness
and thou son of man prophesy against gog and say thus saith
the lord god behold i come against thee o gog the chief prince of
and i will turn thee round and i will lead thee out and will
make thee go up from the northern parts and will bring thee upon the
mountains of israel
and i will break thy bow in thy left hand and i will cause thy
arrows to fall out of thy right hand
thou shalt fall upon the mountains of israel thou and all thy
bands and thy nations that are with thee i have given thee to the wild
beasts to the birds and to every fowl and to the beasts of the earth
to be devoured
thou shalt fall upon the face of the field for i have spoken it
saith the lord god
and i will send a fire on magog and on them that dwell
confidently in the islands and they shall know that i am the lord
and i will make my holy name known in the midst of my people
shall know that i am the lord the holy one of israel
behold it cometh and it is done saith the lord god this is the
day whereof i have spoken
and the inhabitants shall go forth of the cities of israel and
shall set on fire and burn the weapons the shields and the spears the
bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the pikes and they shall
burn them with fire seven years
and they shall not bring wood out of the countries nor cut down
out of the forests for they shall burn the weapons with fire and shall
make a prey of them to whom they had been a prey and they shall rob
those that robbed them saith the lord god
and it shall come to pass in that day that i will give gog a
noted place for a sepulchre in israel the valley of the passengers on
the east of the sea which shall cause astonishment in them that pass
by and there shall they bury gog and all his multitude and it shall
be called the valley of the multitude of gog
and the house of israel shall bury them for seven months to
cleanse the land
and all the people of the land shall bury him and it shall be
unto them a noted day wherein i was glorified saith the lord god
and they shall appoint men to go continually about the land to
bury and to seek out them that were remaining upon the face of the
earth that they may cleanse it and after seven months they shall begin
to seek
and they shall go about passing through the land and when they
shall see the bone of a man they shall set up sign by it till the
buriers bury it in the valley of the multitude of gog
and the name of the city shall be amona and they shall cleanse
the land
and thou o son of man saith the lord god say to every fowl
and to all the birds and to all the beasts of the field assemble
yourselves make haste come together from every side to my victim
which i slay for you a great victim upon the mountains of israel to
eat flesh and drink blood
you shall eat the flesh of the mighty and you shall drink the
blood of the princes of the earth of rams and of lambs and of he
goats and bullocks and of all that are well fed and fat
and you shall eat the fat till you be full and shall drink blood
till you be drunk of the victim which i shall slay for you
and you shall be filled at my table with horses and mighty
horsemen and all the men of war saith the lord god
and i will set my glory among the nations and all nations shall
see my judgment that i have executed and my hand that i have laid upon
them
and the house of israel shall know that i am the lord their god
from that day and forward
and the nations shall know that the house of israel were made
captives for their iniquity because they forsook me and i hid my face
from them and i delivered them into the hands of their enemies and
they fell all by the sword
i have dealt with them according to their uncleanness and
wickedness and hid my face from them
therefore thus saith the lord god now will i bring back the
captivity of jacob and will have mercy on all the house of israel and i
will be jealous for my holy name
and they shall bear their confusion and all the transgressions
wherewith they have transgressed against me when they shall dwell in
their land securely fearing no man
and i shall have brought them back from among the nations and
shall have gathered them together out of the lands of their enemies and
shall be sanctified in them in the sight of many nations
and they shall know that i am the lord their god because i
caused them to be carried away among the nations and i have gathered
them together unto their own land and have not left any of them there
and i will hide my face no more from them for i have poured out
my spirit upon all the house of israel saith the lord god

and the side chambers one by another were twice thirtythree and
they bore outwards that they might enter in through the wall of the
house in the sides round about to hold in and not to touch the wall of
the temple
upon side
and there was a broad passage round about going up by winding
stairs and it led into the upper loft of the temple all round
therefore was the temple broader in the higher parts and so from the
lower parts they went to the higher by the midst
and i saw in the house the height round about the foundations of
the side chambers which were the measure of a reed the space of six
cubits
and the thickness of the wall for the side chamber without which
was five cubits and the inner house was within the side chambers of the
house
these side chambers were in the very walls of the temple all round or

the thresholds and the oblique windows and the galleries round
about on three sides over against the threshold of every one and

the lord
and there were two doors in the temple and in the sanctuary
and in the two doors on both sides were two little doors which
were folded within each other for there were two wickets on both sides
of the doors
and there were cherubims also wrought in the doors of the temple
and the figures of palm trees like as were made on the walls for which

and the breadth of fifty cubits
over against the twenty cubits of the inner court and over
against the pavement of the outward court that was paved with stone
where there was a gallery joined to a triple gallery
and before the chambers was a walk ten cubits broad looking to
the inner parts of a way of one cubit and their doors were toward the
north
where were the store chambers lower above because they bore up
the galleries which appeared above out of them from he lower parts and
from the midst of the building
for they were of three stories and had not pillars as the
pillars of the courts therefore did they appear above out of the lower
places and out of the middle places fifty cubits from the ground
and the outward wall that went about by the chambers which were
towards the outward court on the forepart of the chambers was fifty
cubits long

the north they were as long as they and as broad as they and all the
going in to them and their fashions and their doors were alike
according to the doors of the chambers that were towards the
south there was a door in the head of the way which way was before the
porch separated towards the east as one entereth in
and he said to me the chambers of the north and the chambers of
the south which are before the separate building they are holy
chambers in which the priests shall eat that approach to the lord into
the holy of holies there they shall lay the most holy things and the
offering for sin and for trespass for it is a holy place
and when the priests shall have entered in they shall not go out
of the holy places into the outward court but there they shall lay
their vestments wherein they minister for they are holy and they
shall put on other garments and so they shall go forth to the people
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house he
brought me out by the way of the gate that looked toward the east and
he measured it on every side round about
and he measured toward the east with the measuring reed five
hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about
and he measured toward the north five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed round about
and towards the south he measured five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed round about
and toward the west he measured five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed
by the four winds he measured the wall thereof on every side
round about five hundred cubits and five hundred cubits broad making a
separation between the sanctuary and the place of the people
profane gods name by idolatry the prophet is commanded to shew them
the dimensions and form of the temple and of the altar with the
sacrifices to be offered thereon
and he brought me to the gate that looked towards the east
and behold the glory of the god of israel came in by the way of
the east and his voice was like the noise of many waters and the earth
shone with his majesty
and i saw the vision according to the appearance which i had seen
when he came to destroy the city and the appearance was according to
the vision which i had seen by the river chobar and i fell upon my
face
and the majesty of the lord went into the temple by the way of the
gate that looked to the east
and the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court
and behold the house was filled with the glory of the lord
and i heard one speaking to me out of the house and the man that
stood by me
said to me son of man the place of my throne and the place of
the soles of my feet where i dwell in the midst of the children of
name they and their kings by their fornications and by the carcasses
of their kings and by the high places
they who have set their threshold by my threshold and their posts
by my posts and there was but a wall between me and them and they
profaned my holy name by the abominations which they committed for
which reason i consumed them in my wrath
now therefore let them put away their fornications and the
carcasses of their kings far from me and i will dwell in the midst of
them for ever
but thou son of man shew to the house of israel the temple and
let them be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the
building
and be ashamed of all that they have done shew them the form of
the house and of the fashion thereof the goings out and the comings
in and the whole plan thereof and all its ordinances and all its
order and all its laws and thou shalt write it in their sight that
they may keep the whole form thereof and its ordinances and do them
this is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain all
its border round about most holy this then is the law of the house
and these are the measures of the altar by the truest cubit
which is a cubit and a handbreadth the bottom thereof was a cubit and
the breadth a cubit and the border thereof unto its edge and round
about one handbreadth and this was the trench of the altar
and from the bottom of the ground to the lowest brim two cubits
and the breadth of one cubit and from the lesser brim to the greater
brim four cubits and the breadth of one cubit
and the ariel itself was four cubits and from the ariel upward
were four horns
it upon which the burnt offerings were laid in the hebrew it is harel
that is the mountain of god but in the following verse haariel that
is the lion of god a figure from its consuming and as it were
devouring the sacrifices as a lion devours its prey
and the ariel was twelve cubits long and twelve cubits broad
foursquare with equal sides
and the brim was fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits broad
in the four corners thereof and the crown round about it was half a
cubit and the bottom of it one cubit round about and its steps turned
toward the east
and he said to me son of man thus saith the lord god these are
the ceremonies of the altar in what day soever it shall be made that
holocausts may be offered upon it and blood poured out
and thou shalt give to the priests and the levites that are of
the race of sadoc who approach to me saith the lord god to offer to
me a calf of the herd for sin
and thou shalt take of his blood and shalt put it upon the four
horns thereof and upon the four corners of the brim and upon the crown
round about and thou shalt cleanse and expiate it
and thou shalt take the calf that is offered for sin and thou
shalt burn him in a separate place of the house without the sanctuary
and in the second day thou shalt offer a hegoat without blemish
for sin and they shall expiate the altar as they expiated it with the
calf
and when thou shalt have made an end of the expiation thereof
thou shalt offer a calf of the herd without blemish and a ram of the
flock without blemish
and thou shalt offer them in the sight of the lord and the
priests shall put salt upon them and shall offer them a holocaust to
the lord
seven days shalt thou offer a hegoat for sin daily they shall
offer also a calf of the herd and a ram of the flock without blemish
seven days shall they expiate the altar and shall cleanse it
and they shall consecrate it
it to holy service
and the days being expired on the eighth day and thenceforward
the priests shall offer your holocausts upon the altar and the peace
offerings and i will be pacified towards you saith the lord god
shall not enter into the sanctuary nor the levites that have served
idols but the sons of sadoc shall do the priestly functions who stood
firm in the worst of times
and he brought me back to the way of the gate of the outward
sanctuary which looked towards the east and it was shut
and the lord said to me this gate shall be shut it shall not be
opened and no man shall pass through it because the lord the god of
for the prince the prince himself shall sit in it to eat bread
before the lord he shall enter in by the way of the porch of the gate
and shall go out by the same way
and he brought me by the way of the north gate in the sight of
the house and i saw and behold the glory of the lord filled the house
of the lord and i fell on my face
and the lord said to me son of man attend with thy heart and
behold with thy eyes and hear with thy ears all that i say to thee
concerning all the ceremonies of the house of the lord and concerning
all the laws thereof and mark well the ways of the temple with all the
goings out of the sanctuary
and thou shalt say to the house of israel that provoketh me thus
saith the lord god let all your wicked doings suffice you o house of
in that you have brought in strangers uncircumcised in heart and
uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary and to defile my house
and you offer my bread the fat and the blood and you have broken my
covenant by all your wicked doings
and you have not kept the ordinances of my sanctuary but you have
set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves
thus saith the lord god no stranger uncircumcised in heart and
uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary no stranger that
is in the midst of the children of israel
moreover the levites that went away far from me when the
children of israel went astray and have wandered from me after their
idols and have borne their iniquity
they shall be officers in my sanctuary and doorkeepers of the
gates of the house and ministers to the house they shall slay the
holocausts and the victims of the people and they shall stand in their
sight to minister to them
because they ministered to them before their idols and were a
stumblingblock of iniquity to the house of israel therefore have i
lifted up my hand against them saith the lord god and they shall bear
their iniquity
and they shall not come near to me to do the office of priest to
me neither shall they come near to any of my holy things that are by
the holy of holies but they shall bear their shame and their
wickednesses which they have committed
and i will make them doorkeepers of the house for all the
service thereof and for all that shall be done therein
but the priests and levites the sons of sadoc who kept the
ceremonies of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from
me they shall come near to me to minister to me and they shall stand
before me to offer me the fat and the blood saith the lord god
they shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to
my table to minister unto me and to keep my ceremonies
and when they shall enter in at the gates of the inner court
they shall be clothed with linen garments neither shall any woollen
come upon them when they minister in the gates of the inner court and
within
they shall have linen mitres on their heads and linen breeches
on their loins and they shall not be girded with any thing that causeth
sweat
and when they shall go forth to the outward court to the people
they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered and lay them
up in the store chamber of the sanctuary and they shall clothe
themselves with other garments and they shall not sanctify the people
with their vestments
to the danger of touching the sacred vestments which none were to touch
but they that were sanctified
neither shall they shave their heads nor wear long hair but
they shall only poll their heads
and no priest shall drink wine when he is to go into the inner
court
neither shall they take to wife a widow nor one that is
divorced but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of
and they shall teach my people the difference between holy and
profane and shew them how to discern between clean and unclean
and when there shall be a controversy they shall stand in my
judgments and shall judge they shall keep my laws and my ordinances
in all my solemnities and sanctify my sabbaths
and they shall come near no dead person lest they be defiled
only their father and mother and son and daughter and brother and
sister that hath not had another husband for whom they may become
unclean
and after one is cleansed they shall reckon unto him seven days
and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary to the inner
court to minister unto me in the sanctuary he shall offer for his sin
saith the lord god
and they shall have no inheritance i am their inheritance
neither shall you give them any possession in israel for i am their
possession
they shall eat the victim both for sin and for trespass and
every vowed thing in israel shall be theirs
and the firstfruits of all the firstborn and all the libations of
all things that are offered shall be the priests and you shall give
the firstfruits of your meats to the priest that he may return a
blessing upon thy house
the priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself or
caught by a beast whether it be fowl or cattle
and when you shall begin to divide the land by lot separate ye
firstfruits to the lord a portion of the land to be holy in length
twentyfive thousand and in breadth ten thousand it shall be holy in
all the borders thereof round about
and there shall be for the sanctuary on every side five hundred by
five hundred foursquare round about and fifty cubits for the suburbs
thereof round about
and with this measure thou shalt measure the length of five and
twenty thousand and the breadth of ten thousand and in it shall be the
temple and the holy of holies
the holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
ministers of the sanctuary who come near to the ministry of the lord
and it shall be a place for their houses and for the holy place of the
sanctuary
and five and twenty thousand of length and ten thousand of
breadth shall be for the levites that minister in the house they shall
possess twenty store chambers
and you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
broad and five and twenty thousand long according to the separation of
the sanctuary for the whole house of israel
for the prince also on the one side and on the other side
according to the separation of the sanctuary and according to the
possession of the city over against the separation of the sanctuary
and over against the possession of the city from the side of the sea
even to the sea and from the side of the east even to the east and the
length according to every part from the west border to the east border
he shall have a portion of the land in israel and the princes
shall no more rob my people but they shall give the land to the house
of israel according to their tribes
thus saith the lord god let it suffice you o princes of israel
cease from iniquity and robberies and execute judgment and justice
separate your confines from my people saith the lord god
you shall have just balances and a just ephi and a just bate
the ephi and the bate shall be equal and of one measure that
the bate may contain the tenth part of a core and the ephi the tenth
part of a core their weight shall be equal according to the measure of
a core
bate served for liquids and the ephi for dry things
and the sicle hath twenty obols now twenty sicles and five and
twenty sicles and fifteen sicles make a mna
and these are the firstfruits which you shall take the sixth
part of an ephi of a core of wheat and the sixth part of an ephi of a
core of barley
the measure of oil also a bate of oil is the tenth part of a
core and ten bates make a core for ten bates fill a core
and one ram out of a flock of two hundred of those that israel
feedeth for sacrifice and for holocausts and for peace offerings to
make atonement for them saith the lord god
all the people of the land shall be bound to these firstfruits
for the prince in israel
and the prince shall give the holocaust and the sacrifice and
the libations on the feasts and on the new moons and on the sabbaths
and on all the solemnities of the house of israel he shall offer the
sacrifice for sin and the holocaust and the peace offerings to make
expiation for the house of israel
thus saith the lord god in the first month the first of the
month thou shalt take a calf of the herd without blemish and thou
shalt expiate the sanctuary
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering and
he shall put it on the posts of the house and on the four corners of
the brim of the altar and oil the posts of the gate of the inner court
and so shalt thou do in the seventh day of the month for every
one that hath been ignorant and hath been deceived by error and thou
shalt make expiation for the house
in the first month the fourteenth day of the month you shall
observe the solemnity of the pasch seven days unleavened bread shall be
eaten
and the prince on that day shall offer for himself and for all
the people of the land a calf for sin
and in the solemnity of the seven days he shall offer for a
holocaust to the lord seven calves and seven rams without blemish
daily for seven days and for sin a hegoat daily
and he shall offer the sacrifice of an ephi for every calf and
an ephi for every ram and a hin of oil for every ephi
in the seventh month in the fifteenth day of the month in the
solemn feast he shall do the like for the seven days as well in regard
to the sin offering as to the holocaust and the sacrifice and the
oil
thus saith the lord god the gate of the inner court that looketh
toward the east shall be shut the six days on which work is done but
on the sabbath day it shall be opened yea and on the day of the new
moon it shall be opened
and the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate
from without and he shall stand at the threshold of the gate and the
priests shall offer his holocaust and his peace offerings and he shall
adore upon the threshold of the gate and shall go out but the gate
shall not be shut till the evening
and the people of the land shall adore at the door of that gate
before the lord on the sabbaths and on the new moons
and the holocaust that the prince shall offer to the lord on the
sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without
blemish
and the sacrifice of all ephi for a ram but for the lambs what
sacrifice his hand shall allow and a hin of oil for every ephi
and on the day of the new moon a calf of the herd without blemish
and the six lambs and the rams shall be without blemish
and he shall offer in sacrifice an ephi for calf an ephi also for
a ram but for the lambs as his hand shall find and a hin of oil for
every ephi
and when the prince is to go in let him go in by the way of the
porch of the gate and let him go out the same way
but when the people of the land shall go in before the lord in the
solemn feasts he that goeth in by the north gate to adore shall go out
by the way of the south gate and he that goeth in by the way of the
south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate he shall not
return by the way of the gate whereby he came in but shall go out at
that over against it
and the prince in the midst of them shall go in when they go in
and go out when they go out
and in the fairs and in the solemnities there shall be the
sacrifice of an ephi to a calf and an ephi to a ram and to the lambs
the sacrifice shall be as his hand shall find and a hin of oil to every
ephi
but when the prince shall offer a voluntary holocaust or
voluntary peace offering to the lord the gate that looketh towards the
east shall be opened to him and he shall offer his holocaust and his
peace offerings as it is wont to be done on the sabbath day and he
shall go out and the gate shall be shut after he is gone forth
and he shall offer every day for a holocaust to the lord a lamb
of the same year without blemish he shall offer it always in the
morning
and he shall offer the sacrifice for it morning by morning the
sixth part of an ephi and the third part of a hin of oil to be mingled
with the fine flour a sacrifice to the lord by ordinance continual and
everlasting
he shall offer the lamb and the sacrifice and the oil morning
by morning an everlasting holocaust
thus saith the lord god if the prince give a gift to any of his
sons the inheritance of it shall go to his children they shall possess
it by inheritance
but if he give a legacy out of his inheritance to one of his
servants it shall be his until the year of release and it shall return
to the prince but his inheritance shall go to his sons
and the prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance by
violence nor of their possession but out of his own possession he
shall give an inheritance to his sons that my people be not dispersed
every man from his possession
and he brought me in by the entry that was at the side of the
gate into the chambers of the sanctuary that were for the priests
which looked toward the north and there was a place bending to the
west
and he said to me this is the place where the priests shall boil
the sin offering and the trespass offering where they shall dress the
sacrifice that they may not bring it out into the outward court and
the people be sanctified
and he brought me into the outward court and he led me about by
the four corners of the court and behold there was a little court in
the corner of the court to every corner of the court there was a little
court
in the four corners of the court were little courts disposed
forty cubits long and thirty broad all the four were of one measure
and there was a wall round about compassing the four little
courts and there were kitchens built under the rows round about
and he said to me this is the house of the kitchens wherein the
ministers of the house of the lord shall boil the victims of the people
borders of the land to be divided among the twelve tribes
and he brought me again to the gate of the house and behold
waters issued out from under the threshold of the house toward the east
for the forefront of the house looked toward the east but the waters
came down to the right side of the temple to the south part of the
altar
were none such that flowed from the temple but mystically of the
baptism of christ and of his doctrine and his grace the trees that
grow on the banks are christian virtues the fishes are christians that
spiritually live in and by these holy waters the fishermen are the
apostles and apostolic preachers the fenny places where there is no
health are such as by being out of the church are separated from these
waters of life
and he led me out by the way of the north gate and he caused me
to turn to the way without the outward gate to the way that looked
toward the east and behold there ran out waters on the right side
and when the man that had the line in his hand went out towards
the east he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the
water up to the ankles
and again he measured a thousand and he brought me through the
water up to the knees
and he measured a thousand and he brought me through the water up
to the loins and he measured a thousand and it was a torrent which i
could not pass over for the waters were risen so as to make a deep
torrent which could not be passed over
and he said to me surely thou hast seen o son of man and he
brought me out and he caused me to turn to the bank of the torrent
and when i had turned myself behold on the bank of the torrent
were very many trees on both sides
and he said to me these waters that issue forth toward the
hillocks of sand to the east and go down to the plains of the desert
shall go into the sea and shall go out and the waters shall be healed
and every living creature that creepeth whithersoever the torrent
shall come shall live and there shall be fishes in abundance after
these waters shall come thither and they shall be healed and all
things shall live to which the torrent shall come
and the fishers shall stand over these waters from engaddi even
to engallim there shall be drying of nets there shall be many sorts of
the fishes thereof as the fishes of the great sea a very great
multitude
but on the shore thereof and in the fenny places they shall not
be healed because they shall be turned into saltpits
and by the torrent on the banks thereof on both sides shall grow
all trees that bear fruit their leaf shall not fall off and their
fruit shall not fail every month shall they bring forth firstfruits
because the waters thereof shall issue out of the sanctuary and the
fruits thereof shall be for food and the leaves thereof for medicine
thus saith the lord god this is the border by which you shall
possess the land according to the twelve tribes of israel for joseph
hath a double portion

brother concerning which i lifted up my hand to give it to your

of god with noe and job as three persons most eminent for virtue and
