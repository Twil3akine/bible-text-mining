tolerated in many places
after the death of josue the children of israel consulted the
shall be the leader of the war
and the lord said juda shall go up behold i have delivered the
land into his hands
and juda said to simeon his brother come up with me into my lot
and fight against the chanaanite that i also may go along with thee
into thy lot and simeon went with him
and juda went up and the lord delivered the chanaanite and the
men
and they found adonibezec in bezec and fought against him and
they defeated the chanaanite and the pherezite
and adonibezec fled and they pursued after him and took him and
cut off his fingers and toes
and adonibezec said seventy kings having their fingers and toes
cut off gathered up the leavings of the meat under my table as i have
done so hath god requited me and they brought him to jerusalem and
he died there
and the children of juda besieging jerusalem took it and put it
to the sword and set the whole city on fire
the other salem the one was in the tribe of juda the other in the
tribe of benjamin after it was taken and burnt by the men of juda it
was quickly rebuilt again by the jebusites as we may gather from ver
and continued in their possession till it was taken by king david
and afterwards they went down and fought against the chanaanite
who dwelt in the mountains and in the south and in the plains
and juda going forward against the chanaanite that dwelt in
and ahiman and tholmai
related jos it is here repeated to give the reader at once a
short sketch of all the achievements of the tribe of juda against the
and departing from thence he went to the inhabitants of dabir
the ancient name of which was cariathsepher that is the city of
letters
library kept there
and caleb said he that shall take cariathsepher and lay it
waste to him will i give my daughter axa to wife
and othoniel the son of cenez the younger brother of caleb
having taken it he gave him axa his daughter to wife
and as she was going on her way her husband admonished her to ask
a field of her father and as she sighed sitting on her ass caleb said
to her what aileth thee
but she answered give me a blessing for thou hast given me a dry
land give me also a watery land so caleb gave her the upper and the
nether watery ground
and the children of the cinite the kinsman of moses went up from
the city of palms with the children of juda into the wilderness of his
lot which is at the south side of arad and they dwelt with him
the cinite and his children who came along with the children of israel
settled themselves among them in the land of chanaan embracing their
worship and religion from these the rechabites sprung of whom see jer
ibid the city of palms jericho so called from the abundance of
palm trees
and juda went with simeon his brother and they together defeated
the chanaanites that dwelt in sephaath and slew them and the name of
the city was called horma that is anathema
and juda took gaza with its confines and ascalon and accaron
with their confines
at this time by the israelites but as they took no care to put
garrisons in them the philistines soon recovered them
and the lord was with juda and he possessed the hill country but
was not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley because they had
many chariots armed with scythes
with hooks and scythes and for want of confidence in god
and they gave hebron to caleb as moses had said who destroyed
out of it the three sons of enac
but the sons of benjamin did not destroy the jebusites that
inhabited jerusalem and the jebusite hath dwelt with the sons of
the house of joseph also went up against bethel and the lord was
with them
for when they were besieging the city which before was called
they saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him shew
us the entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy
and when he had shewed them they smote the city with the edge of
the sword but that man and all his kindred they let go
who being sent away went into the land of hetthim and built
there a city and called it luza which is so called until this day
manasses also did not destroy bethsan and thanac with their
villages nor the inhabitants of dor and jeblaam and mageddo with
their villages and the chanaanite began to dwell with them
but after israel was grown strong he made them tributaries and
would not destroy them
ephraim also did not slay the chanaanite that dwelt in gazer but
dwelt with him
zabulon destroyed not the inhabitants of cetron and naalol but
the chanaanite dwelt among them and became their tributary
aser also destroyed not the inhabitants of accho and of sidon of
and he dwelt in the midst of the chanaanites the inhabitants of
that land and did not slay them
nephthali also destroyed not the inhabitants of bethsames and of
of the land and the bethsamites and bethanites were tributaries to him
and the amorrhite straitened the children of dan in the mountain
and gave them not a place to go down to the plain
and he dwelt in the mountain hares that is of potsherds in
him and he became tributary to him
and the border of the amorrhite was from the ascent of the
scorpion the rock and the higher places
afflictions but still fall worse and worse
and an angel of the lord went up from galgal to the place of
weepers and said i made you go out of egypt and have brought you into
the land for which i swore to your fathers and i promised that i would
not make void my covenant with you for ever
on condition that you should not make a league with the inhabitants
of this land but should throw down their altars and you would not hear
my voice why have you done this
wherefore i would not destroy them from before your face that you
may have enemies and their gods may be your ruin
and when the angel of the lord spoke these words to all the
children of israel they lifted up their voice and wept
and the name of that place was called the place of weepers or of
tears and there they offered sacrifices to the lord
and josue sent away the people and the children of israel went
every one to his own possession to hold it
recapitulation of what had happened before and by way of an
introduction to that which follows
and they served the lord all his days and the days of the
ancients that lived a long time after him and who knew all the works
of the lord which he had done for israel
and josue the son of nun the servant of the lord died being a
hundred and ten years old
and they buried him in the borders of his possession in
and all that generation was gathered to their fathers and there
arose others that knew not the lord and the works which he had done for
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and
they served baalim
and they left the lord the god of their fathers who had brought
them out of the land of egypt and they followed strange gods and the
gods of the people that dwelt round about them and they adored them
and they provoked the lord to anger
of a great part of them but not so universally as if the true worship
of god was ever quite abolished among them for the succession of the
true church and religion was kept up all this time by the priests and
forsaking him and serving baal and astaroth
and the lord being angry against israel delivered them into the
hands of plunderers who took them and sold them to their enemies that
dwelt round about neither could they stand against their enemies
but whithersoever they meant to go the hand of the lord was upon
them as he had said and as he had sworn to them and they were greatly
distressed
and the lord raised up judges to deliver them from the hands of
those that oppressed them but they would not hearken to them
committing fornication with strange gods and adoring them they
quickly forsook the way in which their fathers had walked and hearing
the commandments of the lord they did all things contrary
and when the lord raised them up judges in their days he was
moved to mercy and heard the groanings of the afflicted and delivered
them from the slaughter of the oppressors
but after the judge was dead they returned and did much worse
things than their fathers had done following strange gods serving
them and adoring them they left not their own inventions and the
stubborn way by which they were accustomed to walk
and the wrath of the lord was kindled against israel and he said
their fathers and hath despised to hearken to my voice
i also will not destroy the nations which josue left when he died
that through them i may try israel whether they will keep the way
of the lord and walk in it as their fathers kept it or not
the lord therefore left all these nations and would not quickly
destroy them neither did he deliver them into the hands of josue
repenting are delivered by othoniel aod and samgar
these are the nations which the lord left that by them he might
instruct israel and all that had not known the wars of the chanaanites
that afterwards their children might learn to fight with their
enemies and to be trained up to war
the five princes of the philistines and all the chanaanites and
the sidonians and the hevites that dwelt in mount libanus from mount
and he left them that he might try israel by them whether they
would hear the commandments of the lord which he had commanded their
fathers by the hand of moses or not
so the children of israel dwelt in the midst of the chanaanite and
the hethite and the amorrhite and the pherezite and the hevite and
the jebusite
and they took their daughters to wives and they gave their own
daughters to their sons and they served their gods
and they did evil in the sight of the lord and they forgot their
and the lord being angry with israel delivered them into the hands
of chusan rasathaim king of mesopotamia and they served him eight
years
because it lies between the euphrates and the tigris it is absolutely
called syria ver
and they cried to the lord who raised them up a saviour and
delivered them to wit othoniel the son of cenez the younger brother
of caleb
and the spirit of the lord was in him and he judged israel and
he went out to fight and the lord delivered chusan rasathaim king of
and the land rested forty years and othoniel the son of cenez
died
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the
did evil in his sight
and he joined to him the children of ammon and amalec and he
went and overthrew israel and possessed the city of palm trees
and the children of israel served eglon king of moab eighteen
years
and afterwards they cried to the lord who raised them up a
saviour called aod the son of cera the son of jemini who used the
left hand as well as the right and the children of israel sent
presents to eglon king of moab by him
and he made himself a twoedged sword with a haft in the midst of
the length of the palm of the hand and was girded therewith under his
garment on the right thigh
and he presented the gifts to eglon king of moab now eglon was
exceeding fat
and when he had presented the gifts unto him he followed his
companions that came along with him
then returning from galgal where the idols were he said to the
king i have a secret message to thee o king and he commanded silence
and all being gone out that were about him
aod went in to him now he was sitting in a summer parlour alone
and he said i have a word from god to thee and he forthwith rose up
from his throne
such things are not to be imitated by private men
and aod put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his
right thigh and thrust it into his belly
with such force that the haft went in after the blade into the
wound and was closed up with the abundance of fat so that he did not
draw out the dagger but left it in the body as he had struck it in and
forthwith by the secret parts of nature the excrements of the belly
came out
and aod carefully shutting the doors of the parlour and locking
them
went out by a postern door and the kings servants going in saw
the doors of the parlour shut and they said perhaps he is easing
nature in his summer parlour
and waiting a long time till they were ashamed and seeing that
no man opened the door they took a key and opening they found their
lord lying dead on the ground
but aod while they were in confusion escaped and passed by the
place of the idols from whence he had returned and he came to seirath
and forthwith he sounded the trumpet in mount ephraim and the
children of israel went down with him he himself going in the front
and he said to them follow me for the lord hath delivered our
enemies the moabites into our hands and they went down after him and
seized upon the fords of the jordan which are in the way to moab and
they suffered no man to pass over
but they slew of the moabites at that time about ten thousand
all strong and valiant men none of them could escape
and moab was humbled that day under the hand of israel and the
land rested eighty years
after him was samgar the son of anath who slew of the
and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord
after the death of aod
and the lord delivered them up into the hands of jabin king of
and the children of israel cried to the lord for he had nine
hundred chariots set with scythes and for twenty years had grievously
oppressed them
and there was at that time debbora a prophetess the wife of
and she sat under a palm tree which was called by her name
between rama and bethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel
came up to her for all judgment
and she sent and called barac the son of abinoem out of cedes in
thee go and lead an army to mount thabor and thou shalt take with
thee ten thousand fighting men of the children of nephthali and of the
children of zabulon
and i will bring unto thee in the place of the torrent cison
multitude and will deliver them into thy hand
and barac said to her if thou wilt come with me i will go if
thou wilt not come with me i will not go
she said to him i will go indeed with thee but at this time the
victory shall not be attributed to thee because sisara shall be
delivered into the hand of a woman debbora therefore arose and went
with barac to cedes
and he called unto him zabulon and nephthali and went up with ten
thousand fighting men having debbora in his company
now haber the cinite had some time before departed from the rest
of the cinites his brethren the sons of hobab the kinsman of moses
and had pitched his tents unto the valley which is called sennim and
was near cedes
and it was told sisara that barac the son of abinoem was gone
up to mount thabor
and he gathered together his nine hundred chariots armed with
scythes and all his army from haroseth of the gentiles to the torrent
and debbora said to barac arise for this is the day wherein the
him
and the lord struck a terror into sisara and all his chariots
and all his multitude with the edge of the sword at the sight of
away on foot
and barac pursued after the fleeing chariots and the army unto
utterly destroyed
but sisara fleeing came to the tent of jahel the wife of haber
the cinite for there was peace between jabin the king of asor and the
house of haber the cinite
and jahel went forth to meet sisara and said to him come in to
me my lord come in fear not he went into her tent and being covered
by her with a cloak
said to her give me i beseech thee a little water for i am
very thirsty she opened a bottle of milk and gave him to drink and
covered him
and sisara said to her stand before the door of the tent and
when any shall come and inquire of thee saying is there any man here
thou shalt say there is none
so jahel habers wife took a nail of the tent and taking also a
hammer and going in softly and with silence she put the nail upon the
temples of his head and striking it with the hammer drove it through
his brain fast into the ground and so passing from deep sleep to death
he fainted away and died
and behold barac came pursuing after sisara and jahel went out
to meet him and said to him come and i will shew thee the man whom
thou seekest and when he came into her tent he saw sisara lying dead
and the nail fastened in his temples
so god that day humbled jabin the king of chanaan before the
children of israel
who grew daily stronger and with a mighty hand overpowered jabin
king of chanaan till they quite destroyed him
in that day debbora and barac son of abinoem sung and said
o you of israel that have willingly offered your lives to danger
bless the lord
hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes it is i it is i that
will sing to the lord i will sing to the lord the god of israel
o lord when thou wentest out of seir and passedst by the regions
of edom the earth trembled and the heavens and clouds dropped water
the mountains melted before the face of the lord and sinai before
the face of the lord the god of israel
in the days of samgar the son of anath in the days of jahel the
paths rested and they that went by them walked through byeways
and men walked in the byways of error and sin
the valiant men ceased and rested in israel until debbora arose
a mother arose in israel
the lord chose new wars and he himself overthrew the gates of the
enemies a shield and spear was not seen among forty thousand of israel
my heart loveth the princes of israel o you that of your own good
will offered yourselves to danger bless the lord
speak you that ride upon fair asses and you that sit in
judgment and walk in the way
where the chariots were dashed together and the army of the
enemies was choked there let the justices of the lord be rehearsed and
his clemency towards the brave men of israel then the people of the
arise arise o debbora arise arise and utter a canticle
the remnants of the people are saved the lord hath fought among
the valiant ones
out of ephraim he destroyed them into amalec and after him out of
princes and out of zabulon they that led the army to fight
destroyed as they were running through the land of ephraim and of
very confines of amalec or it alludes to former victories of the
people of god particularly that which was freshest in memory when the
men of ephraim and benjamin with aod at their head overthrew their
enemies the moabites with the amalecites their allies see chap
the captains of issachar were with debbora and followed the steps
of barac who exposed himself to danger as one going headlong and into
a pit ruben being divided against himself there was found a strife of
courageous men
the tribe of ruben were divided in their sentiments with relation to
this war which division kept them at home within their own borders to
hear the bleating of their flocks
why dwellest thou between two borders that thou mayst hear the
bleatings of the flocks ruben being divided against himself there was
found a strife of courageous men
galaad rested beyond the jordan and dan applied himself to ships
but zabulon and nephthali offered their lives to death in the
region of merome
the kings came and fought the kings of chanaan fought in thanac
by the waters of mageddo and yet they took no spoils
there was war made against them from heaven the stars remaining
in their order and courses fought against sisara
the torrent of cison dragged their carcasses the torrent of
ones
the hoofs of the horses were broken whilst the stoutest of the
enemies fled amain and fell headlong down
curse ye the land of meroz said the angel of the lord curse the
inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the lord to
help his most valiant men
we cannot find nor is there mention of it anywhere else in holy writ
of god in their warfare against their spiritual enemies
blessed among women be jahel the wife of haber the cinite and
blessed be she in her tent
he asked her water and she gave him milk and offered him butter
in a dish fit for princes
she put her left hand to the nail and her right hand to the
workmans hammer and she struck sisara seeking in his head a place for
the wound and strongly piercing through his temples
between her feet he fell he fainted and he died he rolled
before her feet and there he lay lifeless and wretched
his mother looked out at a window and howled and she spoke from
the dining room why is his chariot so long in coming back why are the
feet of his horses so slow
one that was wiser than the rest of his wives returned this
answer to her motherinlaw
perhaps he is now dividing the spoils and the fairest of the
women is chosen out for him garments of divers colours are given to
to adorn necks
so let all thy enemies perish o lord but let them that love thee
shine as the sun shineth in his rising
and the land rested for forty years
called to deliver them
and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord
and he delivered them into the hand of madian seven years
and they were grievously oppressed by them and they made
themselves dens and caves in the mountains and strong holds to resist
and when israel had sown madian and amalec and the rest of the
eastern nations came up
and pitching their tents among them wasted all things as they were
in the blade even to the entrance of gaza and they left nothing at all
in israel for sustenance of life nor sheep nor oxen nor asses
for they and all their flocks came with their tents and like
locusts filled all places an innumerable multitude of men and of
camels wasting whatsoever they touched
and israel was humbled exceedingly in the sight of madian
and he cried to the lord desiring help against the madianites
and he sent unto them a prophet and he spoke thus saith the lord
the god of israel i made you to come up out of egypt and brought you
out of the house of bondage
and delivered you out of the hands of the egyptians and of all the
enemies that afflicted you and i cast them out at your coming in and
gave you their land
and i said i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the
and an angel of the lord came and sat under an oak that was in
flee from madian
the angel of the lord appeared to him and said the lord is with
thee o most valiant of men
and gedeon said to him i beseech thee my lord if the lord be
with us why have these evils fallen upon us where are his miracles
which our fathers have told us of saying the lord brought us out of
of madian
and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy strength
and thou shalt deliver israel out of the hand of madian know that i
have sent thee
he answered and said i beseech thee my lord wherewith shall i
deliver israel behold my family is the meanest in manasses and i am
the least in my fathers house
who are mean and little in their own eyes for the greatest
enterprises
and the lord said to him i will be with thee and thou shalt cut
off madian as one man
and he said if i have found grace before thee give me a sign
that it is thou that speakest to me
and depart not hence till i return to thee and bring a
sacrifice and offer it to thee and he answered i will wait thy
coming
so gedeon went in and boiled a kid and made unleavened loaves of
a measure of flour and putting the flesh in a basket and the broth of
the flesh into a pot he carried all under the oak and presented to
him
and the angel of the lord said to him take the flesh and the
unleavened loaves and lay them upon that rock and pour out the broth
thereon and when he had done so
the angel of the lord put forth the tip of the rod which he held
in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened loaves and there
arose a fire from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened
loaves and the angel of the lord vanished out of his sight
and gedeon seeing that it was the angel of the lord said alas
my lord god for i have seen the angel of the lord face to face
and the lord said to him peace be with thee fear not thou shalt
not die
and gedeon built there an altar to the lord and called it the
which is of the family of ezri
that night the lord said to him take a bullock of thy fathers
and another bullock of seven years and thou shalt destroy the altar of
altar
and thou shalt build un altar to the lord thy god in the top of
this rock whereupon thou didst lay the sacrifice before and thou shalt
take the second bullock and shalt offer a holocaust upon a pile of the
wood which thou shalt cut down out of the grove
then gedeon taking ten men of his servants did as the lord had
commanded him but fearing his fathers house and the men of that city
he would not do it by day but did all by night
and when the men of that town were risen in the morning they saw
the altar of baal destroyed and the grove cut down and the second
bullock laid upon the altar which then was built
and they said one to another who hath done this and when they
inquired for the author of the fact it was said gedeon the son of
and they said to joas bring out thy son hither that he may die
because he hath destroyed the altar of baal and hath cut down his
grove
he answered them are you the avengers of baal that you fight for
him he that is his adversary let him die before to morrow light
appear if he be a god let him revenge himself on him that hath cast
down his altar
from that day gedeon was called jerobaal because joas had said
now all madian and amalec and the eastern people were gathered
together and passing over the jordan camped in the valley of jezrael
but the spirit of the lord came upon gedeon and he sounded the
trumpet and called together the house of abiezer to follow him
and he sent messengers into all manasses and they also followed
him and other messengers into aser and zabulon and nephthali and
they came to meet him
and gedeon said to god if thou wilt save israel by my hand as
thou hast said
i will put this fleece of wool on the floor if there be dew in
the fleece only and it be dry on all the ground beside i shall know
that by my hand as thou hast said thou wilt deliver israel
and it was so and rising before day wringing the fleece he
filled a vessel with the dew
and he said again to god let not thy wrath be kindled against me
if i try once more seeking a sign in the fleece i pray that the fleece
only may be dry and all the ground wet with dew
and god did that night as he had requested and it was dry on the
fleece only and there was dew on all the ground
then jerobaal who is the same as gedeon rising up early and all
the people with him came to the fountain that is called harad now the
camp of madian was in the valley on the north side of the high hill
and the lord said to gedeon the people that are with thee are
many and madian shall not be delivered into their hands lest israel
should glory against me and say i was delivered by my own strength
instruments in great achievements which depend purely on his grace
such as through pride and self conceit will take the glory to
themselves
speak to the people and proclaim in the hearing of all whosoever
is fearful and timorous let him return so two and twenty thousand men
went away from mount galaad and returned home and only ten thousand
remained
and the lord said to gedeon the people are still too many bring
them to the waters and there i will try them and of whom i shall say
to thee this shall go with thee let him go whom i shall forbid to go
let him return
and when the people were come down to the waters the lord said to
wont to lap thou shalt set apart by themselves but they that shall
drink bowing down their knees shall be on the other side
and the number of them that had lapped water casting it with the
hand to their mouth was three hundred men and all the rest of the
multitude had drunk kneeling
and the lord said to gedeon by the three hundred men that lapped
water i will save you and deliver madian into thy hand but let all
the rest of the people return to their place
their hands and so lapped it before them who laid themselves quite
down to the waters to drink which argued a more eager and sensual
disposition
so taking victuals and trumpets according to their number he
ordered all the rest of the multitude to depart to their tents and he
with the three hundred gave himself to the battle now the camp of madia
was beneath him in the valley
the same night the lord said to him arise and go down into the
camp because i have delivered them into thy hand
but if thou be afraid to go alone let phara thy servant go down
with thee
and when thou shalt hear what they are saying then shall thy
hands be strengthened and thou shalt go down more secure to the
enemies camp and he went down with phara his servant into part of the
camp where was the watch of men in arms
but madian and amalec and all the eastern people lay scattered
in the valley as a multitude of locusts their camels also were
innumerable as the sand that lieth on the sea shore
and when gedeon was come one told his neighbour a dream and in
this manner related what he had seen i dreamt a dream and it seemed to
me as if a hearth cake of barley bread rolled and came down into the
camp of madian and when it was come to a tent it struck it and beat
it down flat to the ground
is condemned in the word of god but in some extraordinary cases as we
here see god is pleased by dreams to foretell what he is about to do
he to whom he spoke answered this is nothing else but the sword
of gedeon the son of joas a man of israel for the lord hath delivered
and when gedeon had heard the dream and the interpretation
thereof he adored and returned to the camp of israel and said arise
for the lord hath delivered the camp of madian into our hands
and he divided the three hundred men into three parts and gave
them trumpets in their hands and empty pitchers and lamps within the
pitchers
and he said to them what you shall see me do do you the same i
will go into one part of the camp and do you as i shall do
when the trumpet shall sound in my hand do you also blow the
trumpets on every side of the camp and shout together to the lord and
to gedeon
and gedeon and the three hundred men that were with him went
into part of the camp at the beginning of the midnight watch and the
watchmen being alarmed they began to sound their trumpets and to clap
the pitchers one against another
in order to spiritual conquests must not only sound with the trumpet of
the word of god but must also break their earthen pitchers by the
mortification of the flesh and its passions and carry lamps in their
hands by the light of their virtues
and when they sounded their trumpets in three places round about
the camp and had broken their pitchers they held their lamps in their
left hands and with their right hands the trumpets which they blew and
they cried out the sword of the lord and of gedeon
standing every man in his place round about the enemies camp so
all the camp was troubled and crying out and howling they fled away
and the three hundred men nevertheless persisted sounding the
trumpets and the lord sent the sword into all the camp and they killed
one another
fleeing as far as bethsetta and the border of abelmahula in
from all manasses pursued after madian
and gedeon sent messengers into all mount ephraim saying come
down to meet madian and take the waters before them to bethbera and the
the jordan as far as bethbera
and having taken two men of madian oreb and zeb oreb they slew
in the rock of oreb and zeb in the winepress of zeb and they pursued
of the jordan
the prey and dieth in a good old age the people return to idolatry
and the men of ephraim said to him what is this that thou meanest
to do that thou wouldst not call us when thou wentest to fight against
and he answered them what could i have done like to that which you
have done is not one bunch of grapes of ephraim better than the
vintages of abiezer
otherwise might have come to extremities so great is the power of
humility both with god and man
the lord hath delivered into your hands the princes of madian oreb
and zeb what could i have done like to what you have done and when he
had said this their spirit was appeased with which they swelled
against him
and when gedeon was come to the jordan he passed over it with the
three hundred men that were with him who were so weary that they could
not pursue after them that fled
and he said to the men of soccoth give i beseech you bread to
the people that is with me for they are faint that we may pursue
the princes of soccoth answered peradventure the palms of the
hands of zebee and salmana are in thy hand and therefore thou demandest
that we should give bread to thy army
and he said to them when the lord therefore shall have delivered
thorns and briers of the desert
and going up from thence he came to phanuel and he spoke the like
things to the men of that place and they also answered him as the men
of soccoth had answered
he said therefore to them also when i shall return a conqueror
in peace i will destroy this tower
but zebee and salmana were resting with all their army for
fifteen thousand men were left of all the troops of the eastern people
and one hundred and twenty thousand warriors that drew the sword were
slain
and gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the
east of nobe and jegbaa and smote the camp of the enemies who were
secure and suspected no hurt
and zebee and salmana fled and gedeon pursued and took them all
their host being put in confusion
and returning from the battle before the sun rising
he took a boy of the men of soccoth and he asked him the names of
the princes and ancients of soccoth and he described unto him seventy
seven men
and he came to soccoth and said to them behold zebee and
hands of zebee and salmana are in thy hands and therefore thou
demandest that we should give bread to the men that are weary and faint
so he took the ancients of the city and thorns and briers of the
desert and tore them with the same and cut in pieces the men of
and he demolished the tower of phanuel and slew the men of the
city
and he said to zebee and salmana what manner of men were they
whom you slew in thabor they answered they were like thee and one of
them as the son of a king
he answered them they were my brethren the sons of my mother as
the lord liveth if you had saved them i would not kill you
and he said to jether his eldest son arise and slay them but
he drew not his sword for he was afraid being but yet a boy
and zebee and salmana said do thou rise and run upon us because
the strength of a man is according to his age gedeon rose up and slew
necks of the camels of kings are wont to be adorned
and all the men of israel said to gedeon rule thou over us and
thy son and thy sons son because thou hast delivered us from the hand
of madian
and he said to them i will not rule over you neither shall my
son rule over you but the lord shall rule over you
and he said to them i desire one request of you give me the
earlets of your spoils for the ismaelites were accustomed to wear
golden earlets
they answered we will give them most willingly and spreading a
mantle on the ground they cast upon it the earlets of the spoils
and the weight of the earlets that he requested was a thousand
seven hundred sicles of gold besides the ornaments and jewels and
purple raiment which the kings of madian were wont to use and besides
the golden chains that were about the camels necks
and gedeon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city ephra
the israelites after his death abused it by making it an instrument of
their idolatrous worship
but madian was humbled before the children of israel neither
could they any more lift up their heads but the land rested for forty
years while gedeon presided
so jerobaal the son of joas went and dwelt in his own house
and he had seventy sons who came out of his thigh for he had
many wives
and his concubine that he had in sichem bore him a son whose
name was abimelech
his concubine as wives of an inferior degree are commonly called in the
and gedeon the son of joas died in a good old age and was buried
in the sepulchre of his father in ephra of the family of ezri
but after gedeon was dead the children of israel turned again
and committed fornication with baalim and they made a covenant with
and they remembered not the lord their god who delivered them out
of the hands of all their enemies round about
neither did they shew mercy to the house of jerobaal gedeon
according to all the good things he had done to israel
the sichemites against abimelech but is overcome abimelech destroyeth
and abimelech the son of jerobaal went to sichem to his mothers
brethren and spoke to them and to all the kindred of his mothers
father saying
speak to all the men of sichem whether is better for you that
seventy men all the sons of jerobaal should rule over you or that one
man should rule over you and withal consider that i am your bone and
your flesh
and his mothers brethren spoke of him to all the men of sichem
all these words and they inclined their hearts after abimelech saying
and they gave him seventy weight of silver out of the temple of
vagabonds and they followed him
they had made with baal chap
and he came to his fathers house in ephra and slew his brethren
the sons of jerobaal seventy men upon one stone and there remained
only joatham the youngest son of jerobaal who was hidden
and all the men of sichem were gathered together and all the
families of the city of mello and they went and made abimelech king by
the oak that stood in sichem
this being told to joatham he went and stood on the top of mount
of sichem so may god hear you
the trees went to anoint a king over them and they said to the
olive tree reign thou over us
and it answered can i leave my fatness which both gods and men
make use of to come to be promoted among the trees
in this manner because oil was used both in the worship of the true
and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and reign over us
and it answered them can i leave my sweetness and my delicious
fruits and go to be promoted among the other trees
and the trees said to the vine come thou and reign over us
and it answered them can i forsake my wine that cheereth god and
men and be promoted among the other trees
because he had appointed it to be offered up with his sacrifices but we
are not obliged to take these words spoken by the trees in joathams
parable according to the strict literal sense but only in a sense
accomodated to the design of the parable expressed in the conclusion of
it
and all the trees said to the bramble come thou and reign over
us
and it answered them if indeed you mean to make me king come
ye and rest under my shadow but if you mean it not let fire come out
from the bramble and devour the cedars of libanus
now therefore if you have done well and without sin in
appointing abimelech king over you and have dealt well with jerobaal
and with his house and have made a suitable return for the benefits of
him who fought for you
and exposed his life to dangers to deliver you from the hand of
and you are now risen up against my fathers house and have
killed his sons seventy men upon one stone and have made abimelech
the son of his handmaid king over the inhabitants of sichem because he
is your brother
if therefore you have dealt well and without fault with jerobaal
and his house rejoice ye this day in abimelech and may he rejoice in
you
but if unjustly let fire come out from him and consume the
inhabitants of sichem and the town of mello and let fire come out from
the men of sichem and from the town of mello and devour abimelech
and when he had said thus he fled and went into bera and dwelt
there for fear of abimelech his brother
so abimelech reigned over israel three years
and the lord sent a very evil spirit between abimelech and the
inhabitants of sichem who began to detest him
and to lay the crime of the murder of the seventy sons of
brother and upon the rest of the princes of the sichemites who aided
him
and they set an ambush against him on the top of the mountains
and while they waited for his coming they committed robberies taking
spoils of all that passed by and it was told abimelech
and gaal the son of obed came with his brethren and went over
to sichem and the inhabitants of sichem taking courage at his coming
went out into the fields wasting the vineyards and treading down
the grapes and singing and dancing they went into the temple of their
god and in their banquets and cups they cursed abimelech
and gaal the son of obed cried who is abimelech and what is
hath made zebul his servant ruler over the men of emor the father of
would to god that some man would put this people under my hand
that i might remove abimelech out of the way and it was said to
for zebul the ruler of the city hearing the words of gaal the
son of obed was very angry
and sent messengers privately to abimelech saying behold gaal
the son of obed is come into sichem with his brethren and endeavoureth
to set the city against thee
arise therefore in the night with the people that is with thee
and lie hid in the field
and betimes in the morning at sun rising set upon the city and
when he shall come out against thee with his people do to him what
thou shalt be able
abimelech therefore arose with all his army by night and laid
ambushes near sichem in four places
and gaal the son of obed went out and stood in the entrance of
the gate of the city and abimelech rose up and all his army with him
from the places of the ambushes
and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul behold a
multitude cometh down from the mountains and he answered him thou
seest the shadows of the mountains as if they were the heads of men and
this is thy mistake
again gaal said behold there cometh people down from the midst
of the land and one troop cometh by the way that looketh towards the
oak
and zebul said to him where is now thy mouth wherewith thou
saidst who is abimelech that we should serve him is not this the
people which thou didst despise go out and fight against him
so gaal went out in the sight of the people of sichem and fought
against abimelech
who chased and put him to flight and drove him to the city and
many were slain of his people even to the gate of the city
and abimelech sat down in ruma but zebul drove gaal and his
companions out of the city and would not suffer them to abide in it
so the day following the people went out into the field and it
was told to abimelech
and he took his army and divided it into three companies and
laid ambushes in the fields and seeing that the people came out of the
city he arose and set upon them
with his own company assaulting and besieging the city whilst
the two other companies chased the enemies that were scattered about the
field
and abimelech assaulted the city all that day and took it and
killed the inhabitants thereof and demolished it so that he sowed salt
in it
and when they who dwelt in the tower of sichem had heard this
they went into the temple of their god berith where they had made a
covenant with him and from thence the place had taken its name and it
was exceeding strong
abimelech also hearing that the men of the tower of sichem were
gathered together
went up into mount selmon he and all his people with him and
taking an axe he cut down the bough of a tree and laying it on his
shoulder and carrying it he said to his companions what you see me
do do ye out of hand
so they cut down boughs from the trees every man as fast as he
could and followed their leader and surrounding the fort they set it
on fire and so it came to pass that with the smoke and with the fire a
thousand persons were killed men and women together of the inhabitants
of the town of sichem
then abimelech departing from thence came to the town of thebes
which he surrounded and besieged with his army
and there was in the midst of the city a high tower to which both
the men and the women were fled together and all the princes of the
city and having shut and strongly barred the gate they stood upon the
battlements of the tower to defend themselves
and abimelech coming near the tower fought stoutly and
approaching to the gate endeavoured to set fire to it
and behold a certain woman casting a piece of a millstone from
above dashed it against the head of abimelech and broke his skull
and he called hastily to his armourbearer and said to him draw
thy sword and kill me lest it should be said that i was slain by a
woman he did as he was commanded and slew him
and when he was dead all the men of israel that were with him
returned to their homes
and god repaid the evil that abimelech had done against his
father killing his seventy brethren
the sichemites also were rewarded for what they had done and the
curse of joatham the son of jerobaal came upon them
fall again into idolatry and are afflicted again by the philistines and
compassion on them
after abimelech there arose a ruler in israel thola son of
mount ephraim
the same mother but by a different father and of a different tribe
and he judged israel three and twenty years and he died and was
buried in samir
to him succeeded jair the galaadite who judged israel for two
and twenty years
having thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and were
princes of thirty cities which from his name were called havoth jair
that is the towns of jair until this present day in the land of
had formerly received from another jair num
and jair died and was buried in the place which is called camon
but the children of israel adding new sins to their old ones did
evil in the sight of the lord and served idols baalim and astaroth
and the gods of syria and of sidon and of moab and of the children of
him
and the lord being angry with them delivered them into the hands
of the philistines and of the children of ammon
and they were afflicted and grievously oppressed for eighteen
years all they that dwelt beyond the jordan in the land of the
insomuch that the children of ammon passing over the jordan
wasted juda and benjamin and ephraim and israel was distressed
exceedingly
and they cried to the lord and said we have sinned against
thee because we have forsaken the lord our god and have served baalim
and the lord said to them did not the egyptians and the
the sidonians also and amalec and chanaan oppress you and you
cried to me and i delivered you out of their hand
and yet you have forsaken me and have worshipped strange gods
therefore i will deliver you no more
go and call upon the gods which you have chosen let them
deliver you in the time of distress
and the children of israel said to the lord we have sinned do
thou unto us whatsoever pleaseth thee only deliver us this time
and saying these things they cast away out of their coasts all
the idols of strange gods and served the lord their god and he was
touched with their miseries
and the children of ammon shouting together pitched their tents
in galaad against whom the children of israel assembled themselves
together and camped in maspha
and the princes of galaad said one to another whosoever of us
shall first begin to fight against the children of ammon he shall be
the leader of the people of galaad
cause against the ammonites then making a vow obtains a signal victory
he performs his vow
there was at that time jephte the galaadite a most valiant man
and a warrior the son of a woman that was a harlot and his father was
now galaad had a wife of whom he had sons who after they were
grown up thrust out jephte saying thou canst not inherit in the house
of our father because thou art born of another mother
then he fled and avoided them and dwelt in the land of tob and
there were gathered to him needy men and robbers and they followed him
as their prince
in those days the children of ammon made war against israel
and as they pressed hard upon them the ancients of galaad went to
fetch jephte out of the land of tob to help them
and they said to him come thou and be our prince and fight
against the children of ammon
and he answered them are not you the men that hated me and cast
me out of my fathers house and now you are come to me constrained by
necessity
and the princes of galaad said to jephte for this cause we are
now come to thee that thou mayst go with us and fight against the
children of ammon and be head over all the inhabitants of galaad
jephte also said to them if you be come to me sincerely that i
should fight for you against the children of ammon and the lord shall
deliver them into my hand shall i be your prince
they answered him the lord who heareth these things he himself
is mediator and witness that we will do as we have promised
jephte therefore went with the princes of galaad and all the
people made him their prince and jephte spoke all his words before the
and he sent messengers to the king of the children of ammon to
say in his name what hast thou to do with me that thou art come
against me to waste my land
and he answered them because israel took away my land when he
came up out of egypt from the confines of the arnon unto the jaboc and
the jordan now therefore restore the same peaceably to me
and jephte again sent word by them and commanded them to say to
the king of ammon
thus saith jephte israel did not take away the land of moab nor
the land of the children of ammon
but when they came up out of egypt he walked through the desert
to the red sea and came into cades
and he sent messengers to the king of edom saying suffer me to
pass through thy land but he would not condescend to his request he
sent also to the king of moab who likewise refused to give him
passage he abode therefore in cades
and went round the land of edom at the side and the land of
camped on the other side of the arnon and he would not enter the bounds
of moab
so israel sent messengers to sehon king of the amorrhites who
dwelt in hesebon and they said to him suffer me to pass through thy
land to the river
but he also despising the words of israel suffered him not to
pass through his borders but gathering an infinite multitude went out
against him to jasa and made strong opposition
and the lord delivered him with all his army into the hands of
the inhabitant of that country
and all the coasts thereof from the arnon to the jaboc and from
the wilderness to the jordan
so the lord the god of israel destroyed the amorrhite his
people of israel fighting against him and wilt thou now possess his
land
are not those things which thy god chamos possesseth due to thee
by right but what the lord our god hath obtained by conquest shall be
our possession
opinion who thought they had a just title to the countries which they
imagined they had conquered by the help of their gods how much more
then had israel in indisputable title to the countries which god by
visible miracles had conquered for them
unless perhaps thou art better than balac the son of sephor
king of moab or canst shew that he strove against israel and fought
against him
whereas he hath dwelt in hesebon and the villages thereof and
in aroer and its villages and in all the cities near the jordan for
three hundred years why have you for so long a time attempted nothing
about this claim
therefore i do not trespass against thee but thou wrongest me by
declaring an unjust war against me the lord be judge and decide this
day between israel and the children of ammon
and the king of the children of ammon would not hearken to the
words of jephte which he sent him by the messengers
therefore the spirit of the lord came upon jephte and going
round galaad and manasses and maspha of galaad and passing over from
thence to the children of ammon
he made a vow to the lord saying if thou wilt deliver the
children of ammon into my hands
whosoever shall first come forth out of the doors of my house
and shall meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon
the same will i offer a holocaust to the lord
according to the condition of the thing so as to offer it up as a
holocaust if it were such a thing as might be offered by the law or to
devote it otherwise to god if it were not such as the law allowed to be
offered in sacrifice and therefore they think the daughter of jephte
was not slain by her father but only consecrated to perpetual
virginity but the common opinion followed by the generality of the holy
fathers and divines is that she was offered as a holocaust in
consequence of her fathers vow and that jephte did not sin at least
not mortally neither in making nor in keeping his vow since he is no
ways blamed for it in scripture and was even inspired by god himself to
make the vow as appears from ver in consequence of which he
obtained the victory and therefore he reasonably concluded that god
who is the master of life and death was pleased on this occasion to
dispense with his own law and that it was the divine will he should
fulfil his vow
and jephte passed over to the children of ammon to fight against
them and the lord delivered them into his hands
and he smote them from aroer till you come to mennith twenty
cities and as far as abel which is set with vineyards with a very
great slaughter and the children of ammon were humbled by the children
of israel
and when jephte returned into maspha to his house his only
daughter met him with timbrels and with dances for he had no other
children
and when he saw her he rent his garments and said alas my
daughter thou hast deceived me and thou thyself art deceived for i
have opened my mouth to the lord and i can do no other thing
and she answered him my father if thou hast opened thy mouth to
the lord do unto me whatsoever thou hast promised since the victory
hath been granted to thee and revenge of thy enemies
and she said to her father grant me only this which i desire
bewail my virginity with my companions
the old testament when women might hope that from some child of theirs
the saviour of the world might one day spring but under the new
and he answered her go and he sent her away for two months and
when she was gone with her comrades and companions she mourned her
virginity in the mountains
and the two months being expired she returned to her father and
he did to her as he had vowed and she knew no man from thence came a
fashion in israel and a custom has been kept
that from year to year the daughters of israel assemble
together and lament the daughter of jephte the galaadite for four
days
slain abeson ahialon and abdon are judges
but behold there arose a sedition in ephraim and passing towards
the north they said to jephte when thou wentest to fight against the
children of ammon why wouldst thou not call us that we might go with
thee therefore we will burn thy house
and he answered them i and my people were at great strife with
the children of ammon and i called you to assist me and you would not
do it
and when i saw this i put my life in my own hands and passed
over against the children of ammon and the lord delivered them into my
hands what have i deserved that you should rise up to fight against
me
then calling to him all the men of galaad he fought against
and manasses
and the galaadites secured the fords of the jordan by which
thither in the flight and said i beseech you let me pass the
not
they asked him say then scibboleth which is interpreted an ear
of corn but he answered sibboleth not being able to express an ear of
corn by the same letter then presently they took him and killed him in
the very passage of the jordan and there fell at that time of ephraim
two and forty thousand
and jephte the galaadite judged israel six years and he died
and was buried in his city of galaad
after him abesan of bethlehem judged israel
he had thirty sons and as many daughters whom he sent abroad
and gave to husbands and took wives for his sons of the same number
bringing them into his house and he judged israel seven years
and he died and was buried in bethlehem
to him succeeded ahialon a zabulonite and he judged israel ten
years
and he died and was buried in zabulon
after him abdon the son of illel a pharathonite judged
and he had forty sons and of them thirty grandsons mounted upon
seventy ass colts and he judged israel eight years
and he died and was buried in pharathon in the land of ephraim
in the mount of amalech
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the
years
now there was a certain man of saraa and of the race of dan
whose name was manue and his wife was barren
and an angel of the lord appeared to her and said thou art
barren and without children but thou shalt conceive and bear a son
now therefore beware and drink no wine nor strong drink and eat
not any unclean thing
because thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall
touch his head for he shall be a nazarite of god from his infancy and
from his mothers womb and he shall begin to deliver israel from the
hands of the philistines
and when she was come to her husband she said to him a man of
tell me
but he answered thus behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son
beware thou drink no wine nor strong drink nor eat any unclean thing
for the child shall be a nazarite of god from his infancy from his
mothers womb until the day of his death
then manue prayed to the lord and said i beseech thee o lord
that the man of god whom thou didst send may come again and teach us
what we ought to do concerning the child that shall be born
and the lord heard the prayer of manue and the angel of the lord
appeared again to his wife as she was sitting in the field but manue
her husband was not with her and when she saw the angel
she made haste and ran to her husband and told him saying
he rose up and followed his wife and coming to the man said to
him art thou he that spoke to the woman and he answered i am
and manue said to him when thy word shall come to pass what
wilt thou that the child should do or from what shall he keep himself
and the angel of the lord said to manue from all the things i
have spoken of to thy wife let her refrain herself
abstinence was prescribed to the mother or to the child but the hebrew
in which the verbs relating thereto are of the feminine gender
determineth it to the mother but then the child also was to refrain
from the like things because he was to be from his infancy a nazarite
of god ver that is one set aside in a particular manner and
consecrated to god now the nazarites by the law were to abstain from
all these things
and let her eat nothing that cometh of the vine neither let her
drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing and whatsoever i
have commanded her let her fulfil and observe
and manue said to the angel of the lord i beseech thee to
consent to my request and let us dress a kid for thee
and the angel answered him if thou press me i will not eat of
thy bread but if thou wilt offer a holocaust offer it to the lord and
and he said to him what is thy name that if thy word shall
come to pass we may honour thee
and he answered him why askest thou my name which is wonderful
then manue took a kid of the flocks and the libations and put
them upon a rock offering to the lord who doth wonderful things and
he and his wife looked on
and when the flame from the altar went up towards heaven the
angel of the lord ascended also in the same and when manue and his wife
saw this they fell flat on the ground
and the angel of the lord appeared to them no more and forthwith
and he said to his wife we shall certainly die because we have
seen god
angel taking occasion perhaps from those words spoken by the lord to
demonstrated that it was but a groundless imagination
and his wife answered him if the lord had a mind to kill us he
would not have received a holocaust and libations at our hands neither
would he have shewed us all these things nor have told us the things
that are to come
and she bore a son and called his name samson and the child
grew and the lord blessed him
and the spirit of the lord began to be with him in the camp of
mouth he afterwards findeth honey his marriage feast and riddle which
is discovered by his wife he killeth and strippeth thirty philistines
then samson went down to thamnatha and seeing there a woman of
the daughters of the philistines
he came up and told his father and his mother saying i saw a
woman in thamnatha of the daughters of the philistines i beseech you
take her for me to wife
and his father and mother said to him is there no woman among the
daughters of thy brethren or among all my people that thou wilt take a
wife of the philistines who are uncircumcised and samson said to his
father take this woman for me for she hath pleased my eyes
parents were at first against his marriage with a gentile it being
prohibited deut but afterwards they consented knowing it to be
by the dispensation of god which otherwise would have been sinful in
acting contrary to the law
now his parents knew not that the thing was done by the lord and
that he sought an occasion against the philistines for at that time the
then samson went down with his father and mother to thamnatha and
when they were come to the vineyards of the town behold a young lion
met him raging and roaring
and the spirit of the lord came upon samson and he tore the lion
as he would have torn a kid in pieces having nothing at all in his
hand and he would not tell this to his father and mother
and he went down and spoke to the woman that had pleased his
eyes
and after some days returning to take her he went aside to see
the carcass of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees in the
mouth of the lion and a honeycomb
and when he had taken it in his hands he went on eating and
coming to his father and mother he gave them of it and they ate but
he would not tell them that he had taken the honey from the body of the
lion
so his father went down to the woman and made a feast for his
son samson for so the young men used to do
and when the citizens of that place saw him they brought him
thirty companions to be with him
and samson said to them i will propose to you a riddle which if
you declare unto me within the seven days of the feast i will give you
thirty shirts and as many coats
but if you shall not be able to declare it you shall give me
thirty shirts and the same number of coats they answered him put forth
the riddle that we may hear it
and he said to them out of the eater came forth meat and out of
the strong came forth sweetness and they could not for three days
expound the riddle
and when the seventh day came they said to the wife of samson
meaneth but if thou wilt not do it we will burn thee and thy fathers
house have you called us to the wedding on purpose to strip us
so she wept before samson and complained saying thou hatest me
and dost not love me therefore thou wilt not expound to me the riddle
which thou hast proposed to the sons of my people but he answered i
would not tell it to my father and mother and how can i tell it to
thee
so she wept before him the seven days of the feast and at
length on the seventh day as she was troublesome to him he expounded
it and she immediately told her countrymen
and they on the seventh day before the sun went down said to
him what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion and
he said to them if you had not ploughed with my heifer you had not
found out my riddle
and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he went down to
to them that had declared the riddle and being exceeding angry he went
up to his fathers house
but his wife took one of his friends and bridal companions for
her husband
kills many of them
and a while after when the days of the wheat harvest were at
hand samson came meaning to visit his wife and he brought her a kid
of the flock and when he would have gone into her chamber as usual
her father would not suffer him saying
i thought thou hadst hated her and therefore i gave her to thy
friend but she hath a sister who is younger and fairer than she take
her to wife instead of her
and samson answered him from this day i shall be blameless in
what i do against the philistines for i will do you evils
and he went and caught three hundred foxes and coupled them tail
to tail and fastened torches between the tails
catch with nets or otherwise a number of these animals of which there
were great numbers in that country
and setting them on fire he let the foxes go that they might run
about hither and thither and they presently went into the standing corn
of the philistines which being set on fire both the corn that was
already carried together and that which was yet standing was all
burnt insomuch that the flame consumed also the vineyards and the
oliveyards
then the philistines said who hath done this thing and it was
answered samson the soninlaw of the thamnathite because he took
away his wife and gave her to another hath done these things and the
but samson said to them although you have done this yet will i
be revenged of you and then i will be quiet
and he made a great slaughter of them so that in astonishment
they laid the calf of the leg upon the thigh and going down he dwelt in
a cavern of the rock etam
then the philistines going up into the land of juda camped in the
place which afterwards was called lechi that is the jawbone where
their army was spread abroad
and the men of the tribe of juda said to them why are you come
up against us they answered we are come to bind samson and to pay him
for what he hath done against us
wherefore three thousand men of juda went down to the cave of the
rock etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines
rule over us why wouldst thou do thus and he said to them as they
did to me so have i done to them
and they said to him we are come to bind thee and to deliver
thee into the hands of the philistines and samson said to them swear
to me and promise me that you will not kill me
they said we will not kill thee but we will deliver thee up
bound and they bound him with two new cords and brought him from the
rock etam
now when he was come to the place of the jawbone and the
strongly upon him and as flax is wont to be consumed at the approach of
fire so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed
and finding a jawbone even the jawbone of an ass which lay
there catching it up he slew therewith a thousand men
and he said with the jawbone of an ass with the jaw of the colt
of asses i have destroyed them and have slain a thousand men
and when he had ended these words singing he threw the jawbone
out of his hand and called the name of that place ramathlechi which is
interpreted the lifting up of the jawbone
and being very thirsty he cried to the lord and said thou hast
given this very great deliverance and victory into the hand of thy
servant and behold i die for thirst and shall fall into the hands of
the uncircumcised
then the lord opened a great tooth in the jaw of the ass and
waters issued out of it and when he had drunk them he refreshed his
spirit and recovered his strength therefore the name of that place was
called the spring of him that invoked from the jawbone until this
present day
and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty
years
he went also into gaza and saw there a woman a harlot and went
in unto her
and when the philistines had heard this and it was noised about
among them that samson was come into the city they surrounded him
setting guards at the gate of the city and watching there all the night
in silence that in the morning they might kill him as he went out
but samson slept till midnight and then rising he took both the
doors of the gate with the posts thereof and the bolt and laying them
on his shoulders carried them up to the top of the hill which looketh
towards hebron
after this he loved a woman who dwelt in the valley of sorec and
she was called dalila
was his harlot if the latter opinion be true we cannot wonder that in
punishment of his lust the lord delivered him up by her means into
the hands of his enemies however if he was guilty it is not to be
doubted but that under his afflictions he heartily repented and returned
to god and so obtained forgiveness of his sins
and the princes of the philistines came to her and said deceive
him and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth and how we may
be able to overcome him to bind and afflict him which if thou shalt
do we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver
and dalila said to samson tell me i beseech thee wherein thy
greatest strength lieth and what it is wherewith if thou wert bound
thou couldst not break loose
and samson answered her if i shall be bound with seven cords
made of sinews not yet dry but still moist i shall be weak like other
men
and the princes of the philistines brought unto her seven cords
such as he spoke of with which she bound him
men lying privately in wait with her and in the chamber
expecting the event of the thing and she cried out to him the
would break a thread of tow twined with spittle when it smelleth the
fire so it was not known wherein his strength lay
and dalila said to him behold thou hast mocked me and hast told
me a false thing but now at least tell me wherewith thou mayest be
bound
and he answered her if i shall be bound with new ropes that
were never in work i shall be weak and like other men
dalila bound him again with these and cried out the philistines
are upon thee samson there being an ambush prepared for him in the
chamber but he broke the bands like threads of webs
and dalila said to him again how long dost thou deceive me and
tell me lies shew me wherewith thou mayest be bound and samson
answered her if thou plattest the seven locks of my head with a lace
and tying them round about a nail fastenest it in the ground i shall
be weak
and when dalila had done this she said to him the philistines
are upon thee samson and awaking out of his sleep he drew out the
nail with the hairs and the lace
and dalila said to him how dost thou say thou lovest me when
thy mind is not with me thou hast told me lies these three times and
wouldst not tell me wherein thy greatest strength lieth
and when she pressed him much and continually hung upon him for
many days giving him no time to rest his soul fainted away and was
wearied even unto death
then opening the truth of the thing he said to her the razor
hath never come upon my head for i am a nazarite that is to say
consecrated to god from my mothers womb if my head be shaven my
strength shall depart from me and i shall become weak and shall be
like other men
then seeing that he had discovered to her all his mind she sent
to the princes of the philistines saying come up this once more for
now he hath opened his heart to me and they went up taking with them
the money which they had promised
but she made him sleep upon her knees and lay his head in her
bosom and she called a barber and shaved his seven locks and began to
drive him away and thrust him from her for immediately his strength
departed from him
and she said the philistines are upon thee samson and awaking
from sleep he said in his mind i will go out as i did before and
shake myself not knowing that the lord was departed from him
then the philistines seized upon him and forthwith pulled out
his eyes and led him bound in chains to gaza and shutting him up in
prison made him grind
and now his hair began to grow again
and the princes of the philistines assembled together to offer
great sacrifices to dagon their god and to make merry saying our god
hath delivered our enemy samson into our hands
and the people also seeing this praised their god and said the
same our god hath delivered our adversary into our hands him that
destroyed our country and killed very many
and rejoicing in their feasts when they had now taken their good
cheer they commanded that samson should be called and should play
before them and being brought out of prison he played before them and
they made him stand between two pillars
and he said to the lad that guided his steps suffer me to touch
the pillars which support the whole house and let me lean upon them
and rest a little
now the house was full of men and women and all the princes of
the philistines were there moreover about three thousand persons of
both sexes from the roof and the higher part of the house were
beholding samsons play
but he called upon the lord saying o lord god remember me and
restore to me now my former strength o my god that i may revenge
myself on my enemies and for the loss of my two eyes i may take one
revenge
against the enemies of god and his people and not out of private
rancour and malice of heart
and laying hold on both the pillars on which the house rested
and holding the one with his right hand and the other with his left
he said let me die with the philistines and when he had
strongly shook the pillars the house fell upon all the princes and the
rest of the multitude that was there and he killed many more at his
death than he had killed before in his life
occasion though he was indirectly the cause of his own death because
he was moved to what he did by a particular inspiration of god who
also concurred with him by a miracle in restoring his strength upon the
spot in consequence of his prayer samson by dying in this manner was
a figure of christ who by his death overcame all his enemies
and his brethren and all his kindred going down took his body
and buried it between saraa and esthaol in the buryingplace of his
father manue and he judged israel twenty years
there was at that time a man of mount ephraim whose name was
who said to his mother the eleven hundred pieces of silver which
thou hadst put aside for thyself and concerning which thou didst swear
in my hearing behold i have and they are with me and she said to him
so he restored them to his mother who said to him i have
consecrated and vowed this silver to the lord that my son may receive
it at my hand and make a graven and a molten god so now i deliver it
to thee
and he restored them to his mother and she took two hundred
pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith to make of them a
graven and a molten god which was in the house of michas
and he separated also therein a little temple for the god and
made an ephod and theraphim that is to say a priestly garment and
idols and he filled the hand of one of his sons and he became his
priest
priestly office
in those days there was no king in israel but every one did that
which seemed right to himself
there was also another young man of bethlehem juda of the kindred
thereof and he was a levite and dwelt there
now he went out from the city of bethlehem and desired to sojourn
wheresoever he should find it convenient for him and when he was come
to mount ephraim as he was on his journey and had turned aside a
little into the house of michas
he was asked by him whence he came and he answered i am a levite
of bethlehem juda and i am going to dwell where i can and where i
shall find a place to my advantage
and michas said stay with me and be unto me a father and a
priest and i will give thee every year ten pieces of silver and a
double suit of apparel and thy victuals
he was content and abode with the man and was unto him as one
of his sons
and michas filled his hand and had the young man with him for
his priest saying
now i know god will do me good since i have a priest of the race
of the levites
in those days there was no king in israel and the tribe of dan
sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto that day they had not
received their lot among the other tribes
so the children of dan sent five most valiant men of their stock
and family from saraa and esthaol to spy out the land and to view it
diligently and they said to them go and view the land they went on
their way and when they came to mount ephraim they went into the house
of michas and rested there
and knowing the voice of the young man the levite and lodging
with him they said to him who brought thee hither what dost thou
here why wouldst thou come hither
he answered them michas hath done such and such things for me
and hath hired me to be his priest
then they desired him to consult the lord that they might know
whether their journey should be prosperous and the thing should have
effect
he answered them go in peace the lord looketh on your way and
the journey that you go
so the five men going on came to lais and they saw how the people
dwelt therein without any fear according to the custom of the
very rich and living separated at a distance from sidon and from all
men
and they returned to their brethren in saraa and esthaol who
asked them what they had done to whom they answered
arise and let us go up to them for we have seen the land which
is exceeding rich and fruitful neglect not lose no time let us go and
possess it there will be no difficulty
we shall come to a people that is secure into a spacious
country and the lord will deliver the place to us in which there is no
want of any thing that groweth on the earth
there went therefore of the kindred of dan to wit from saraa
and esthaol six hundred men furnished with arms for war
and going up they lodged in cariathiarim of juda which place
from that time is called the camp of dan and is behind cariathiarim
from thence they passed into mount ephraim and when they were
come to the house of michas
the five men that before had been sent to view the land of lais
said to the rest of their brethren you know that in these houses there
is an ephod and theraphim and a graven and a molten god see what you
are pleased to do
and when they had turned a little aside they went into the house
of the young man the levite who was in the house of michas and they
saluted him with words of peace
and the six hundred men stood before the door appointed with
their arms
but they that were gone into the house of the young man went
about to take away the graven god and the ephod and the theraphim and
the molten god and the priest stood before the door the six hundred
valiant men waiting not far off
so they that were gone in took away the graven thing the ephod
and the idols and the molten god and the priest said to them what are
you doing
and they said to him hold thy peace and put thy finger on thy
mouth and come with us that we may have thee for a father and a
priest whether is better for thee to be a priest in the house of one
man or in a tribe and family in israel
when he heard this he agreed to their words and took the ephod
and the idols and the graven god and departed with them
and when they were going forward and had put before them the
children and the cattle and all that was valuable
and were now at a distance from the house of michas the men that
dwelt in the houses of michas gathering together followed them
and began to shout out after them they looked back and said to
and he answered you have taken away my gods which i have made
me and the priest and all that i have and do you say what aileth
thee
and the children of dan said to him see thou say no more to us
lest men enraged come upon thee and thou perish with all thy house
and so they went on the journey they had begun but michas
seeing that they were stronger than he returned to his house
and the six hundred men took the priest and the things we spoke
of before and came to lais to a people that was quiet and secure and
smote them with the edge of the sword and the city they burnt with
fire
there being no man at all who brought them any succour because
they dwelt far from sidon and had no society or business with any man
therein
calling the name of the city dan after the name of their father
who was the son of israel which before was called lais
and they set up to themselves the graven idol and jonathan the
son of gersam the son of moses he and his sons were priests in the
tribe of dan until the day of their captivity
and the idol of michas remained with them all the time that the
house of god was in silo in those days there was no king in israel
tribe of benjamin his wife is there abused by wicked men and in the
morning found dead her husband cutteth her body in pieces and sendeth
to every tribe of israel requiring them to revenge the wicked fact
there was a certain levite who dwelt on the side of mount
and she left him and returned to her fathers house in bethlehem
and abode with him four months
and her husband followed her willing to be reconciled with her
and to speak kindly to her and to bring her back with him having with
him a servant and two asses and she received him and brought him into
her fathers house and when his fatherinlaw had heard this and had
seen him he met him with joy
and embraced the man and the soninlaw tarried in the house of
his fatherinlaw three days eating with him and drinking familiarly
but on the fourth day arising early in the morning he desired to
depart but his fatherinlaw kept him and said to him taste first a
little bread and strengthen thy stomach and so thou shalt depart
and they sat down together and ate and drank and the father of
the young woman said to his soninlaw i beseech thee to stay here to
day and let us make merry together
but he rising up began to be for departing and nevertheless his
fatherinlaw earnestly pressed him and made him stay with him
but when morning was come the levite prepared to go on his
journey and his fatherinlaw said to him again i beseech thee to take
a little meat and strengthening thyself till the day be farther
advanced afterwards thou mayest depart and they ate together
and the young man arose to set forward with his wife and servant
declining and draweth toward evening tarry with me to day also and
spend the day in mirth and to morrow thou shalt depart that thou
mayest go into thy house
his soninlaw would not consent to his words but forthwith went
forward and came over against jebus which by another name is called
frequently in scripture called concubines see above chap ver
ver jemini that is benjamin
and now they were come near jebus and the day was far spent and
the servant said to his master come i beseech thee let us turn into
the city of the jebusites and lodge there
his master answered him i will not go into the town of another
nation who are not of the children of israel but i will pass over to
and when i shall come thither we will lodge there or at least
in the city of rama
so they passed by jebus and went on their journey and the sun
went down upon them when they were by gabaa which is in the tribe of
and they turned into it to lodge there and when they were come
in they sat in the street of the city for no man would receive them to
lodge
and behold they saw an old man returning out of the field and
from his work in the evening and he also was of mount ephraim and
dwelt as a stranger in gabaa but the men of that country were the
children of jemini
and the old man lifting up his eyes saw the man sitting with his
bundles in the street of the city and said to him whence comest thou
and whither goest thou
he answered him we came out from bethlehem juda and we are
going to our home which is on the side of mount ephraim from whence we
went to bethlehem and now we go to the house of god and none will
receive us under his roof
we have straw and hay for provender of the asses and bread and
wine for the use of myself and of thy handmaid and of the servant that
is with me we want nothing but lodging
and the old man answered him peace be with thee i will furnish
all things that are necessary only i beseech thee stay not in the
street
and he brought him into his house and gave provender to his
asses and after they had washed their feet he entertained them with a
feast
while they were making merry and refreshing their bodies with
meat and drink after the labour of the journey the men of that city
sons of belial that is without yoke came and beset the old mans
house and began to knock at the door calling to the master of the
house and saying bring forth the man that came into thy house that we
may abuse him
and the old man went out to them and said do not so my
brethren do not so wickedly because this man is come into my lodging
and cease i pray you from this folly
i have a maiden daughter and this man hath a concubine i will
bring them out to you and you may humble them and satisfy your lust
only i beseech you commit not this crime against nature on the man
they would not be satisfied with his words which the man seeing
brought out his concubine to them and abandoned her to their
wickedness and when they had abused her all the night they let her go
in the morning
but the woman at the dawning of the day came to the door of the
house where her lord lodged and there fell down
and in the morning the man arose and opened the door that he
might end the journey he had begun and behold his concubine lay before
the door with her hands spread on the threshold
he thinking she was taking her rest said to her arise and let
us be going but as she made no answer perceiving she was dead he took
her up and laid her upon his ass and returned to his house
and when he was come home he took a sword and divided the dead
body of his wife with her bones into twelve parts and sent the pieces
into all the borders of israel
and when every one had seen this they all cried out there was
never such a thing done in israel from the day that our fathers came up
out of egypt until this day give sentence and decree in common what
ought to be done
third battle the benjamites are all slain saving six hundred men
then all the children of israel went out and gathered together as
one man from dan to bersabee with the land of galaad to the lord in
and all the chiefs of the people and all the tribes of israel
met together in the assembly of the people of god four hundred thousand
footmen fit for war
nor were the children of benjamin ignorant that the children of
that was killed being asked how so great a wickedness had been
committed
answered i came into gabaa of benjamin with my wife and there
and behold the men of that city in the night beset the house
wherein i was intending to kill me and abused my wife with an
incredible fury of lust so that at last she died
and i took her and cut her in pieces and sent the parts into all
the borders of your possession because there never was so heinous a
crime and so great an abomination committed in israel
you are all here o children of israel determine what you ought
to do
and all the people standing answered as by the voice of one man
own house
but this we will do in common against gabaa
we will take ten men of a hundred out of all the tribes of
thousand to bring victuals for the army that we may fight against
deserveth
and all israel were gathered together against the city as one
man with one mind and one counsel
and they sent messengers to all the tribe of benjamin to say to
them why hath so great an abomination been found among you
deliver up the men of gabaa that have committed this heinous
crime that they may die and the evil may be taken away out of israel
children of israel
but out of all the cities which were of their lot they gathered
themselves together into gabaa to aid them and to fight against the
whole people of israel
and there were found of benjamin five and twenty thousand men
that drew the sword besides the inhabitants of gabaa
who were seven hundred most valiant men fighting with the left
hand as well as with the right and slinging stones so sure that they
could hit even a hair and not miss by the stones going on either side
of the men of israel also beside the children of benjamin were
found four hundred thousand that drew swords and were prepared to fight
and they arose and came to the house of god that is to silo
and they consulted god and said who shall be in our army the first to
go to the battle against the children of benjamin and the lord answered
them let juda be your leader
and forthwith the children of israel rising in the morning
camped by gabaa
and going out from thence to fight against benjamin began to
assault the city
and the children of benjamin coming out of gabaa slew of the
children of israel that day two and twenty thousand men
again israel trusting in their strength and their number set
their army in array in the same place where they had fought before
and many of them to be slain though their cause was just partly in
punishment of the idolatry which they exercised or tolerated in the
tribe of dan and elsewhere and partly because they trusted in their
own strength and therefore though he bid them fight he would not give
them the victory till they were thoroughly humbled and had learned to
trust in him alone
yet so that they first went up and wept before the lord until
night and consulted him and said shall i go out any more to fight
against the children of benjamin my brethren or not and he answered
them go up against them and join battle
and when the children of israel went out the next day to fight
against the children of benjamin
the children of benjamin sallied forth out of the gates of gabaa
and meeting them made so great a slaughter of them as to kill eighteen
thousand men that drew the sword
wherefore all the children of israel came to the house of god
and sat and wept before the lord and they fasted that day till the
evening and offered to him holocausts and victims of peace offerings
and inquired of him concerning their state at that time the ark
of the covenant of the lord was there
and phinees the son of eleazar the son of aaron was over the
house so they consulted the lord and said shall we go out any more to
fight against the children of benjamin our brethren or shall we cease
your hands
and the children of israel set ambushes round about the city of
and they drew up their army against benjamin the third time as
they had done the first and second
and the children of benjamin boldly issued out of the city and
seeing their enemies flee pursued them a long way so as to wound and
kill some of them as they had done the first and second day whilst
they fled by two highways whereof one goeth up to bethel and the other
to gabaa and they slew about thirty men
for they thought to cut them off as they did before but they
artfully feigning a flight designed to draw them away from the city
and by their seeming to flee to bring them to the highways aforesaid
then all the children of israel rising up out of the places where
they were set their army in battle array in the place which is called
little and little to come forth
and to march from the west side of the city and other ten
thousand men chosen out of all israel attacked the inhabitants of the
city and the battle grew hot against the children of benjamin and they
understood not that present death threatened them on every side
and the lord defeated them before the children of israel and
they slew of them in that day five and twenty thousand and one hundred
all fighting men and that drew the sword
but the children of benjamin when they saw themselves to be too
weak began to flee which the children of israel seeing gave them
place to flee that they might come to the ambushes that were prepared
which they had set near the city
and they that were in ambush arose on a sudden out of their
coverts and whilst benjamin turned their backs to the slayers went
into the city and smote it with the edge of the sword
now the children of israel had given a sign to them whom they
had laid in ambushes that after they had taken the city they should
make a fire that by the smoke rising on high they might shew that the
city was taken
and when the children of israel saw this in the battle for the
children of benjamin thought they fled and pursued them vigorously
killing thirty men of their army
and perceived as it were a pillar of smoke rise up from the
city and benjamin looking back saw that the city was taken and that
the flames ascended on high
they that before had made as if they fled turning their faces
stood bravely against them which the children of benjamin seeing
turned their backs
and began to go towards the way of the desert the enemy pursuing
them thither also and they that fired the city came also out to meet
them
and so it was that they were slain on both sides by the enemies
and there was no rest of their men dying they fell and were beaten down
on the east side of the city of gabaa
and they that were slain in the same place were eighteen
thousand men all most valiant soldiers
and when they that remained of benjamin saw this they fled into
the wilderness and made towards the rock that is called remmon in that
flight also as they were straggling and going different ways they
slew of them five thousand men and as they went farther they still
pursued them and slew also other two thousand
and so it came to pass that all that were slain of benjamin in
divers places were five and twenty thousand fighting men most valiant
for war
and there remained of all the number of benjamin only six hundred
men that were able to escape and flee to the wilderness and they abode
in the rock remmon four months
but the children of israel returning put all the remains of the
city to the sword both men and beasts and all the cities and villages
of benjamin were consumed with devouring flames
wives for the six hundred that remained
now the children of israel had also sworn in maspha saying none
of us shall give of his daughters to the children of benjamin to wife
and they all came to the house of god in silo and sitting before
him till the evening lifted up their voices and began to lament and
weep saying
o lord god of israel why is so great an evil come to pass in thy
people that this day one tribe should be taken away from among us
and rising early the next day they built an altar and offered
there holocausts and victims of peace and they said
who is there among all the tribes of israel that came not up with
the army of the lord for they had bound themselves with a great oath
when they were in maspha that whosoever were wanting should be slain
and the children of israel being moved with repentance for their
brother benjamin began to say one tribe is taken away from israel
whence shall they take wives for we have all in general sworn
not to give our daughters to them
therefore they said who is there of all the tribes of israel
that came not up to the lord to maspha and behold the inhabitants of
at that time also when they were in silo no one of them was
found there
so they sent ten thousand of the most valiant men and commanded
them saying go and put the inhabitants of jabes galaad to the sword
with their wives and their children
and this is what you shall observe every male and all women
that have known men you shall kill but the virgins you shall save
and there were found of jabes galaad four hundred virgins that
had not known the bed of a man and they brought them to the camp in
and they sent messengers to the children of benjamin that were
in the rock remmon and commanded them to receive them in peace
and the children of benjamin came at that time and wives were
given them of jabes galaad but they found no others whom they might
give in like manner
and all israel was very sorry and repented for the destroying of
one tribe out of israel
and the ancients said what shall we do with the rest that have
not received wives for all the women in benjamin are dead
and we must use all care and provide with great diligence that
one tribe be not destroyed out of israel
for as to our own daughters we cannot give them being bound with
an oath and a curse whereby we said cursed be he that shall give
so they took counsel and said behold there is a yearly
solemnity of the lord in silo which is situate on the north of the city
of bethel and on the east side of the way that goeth from bethel to
and they commanded the children of benjamin and said go and lie
hid in the vineyards
and when you shall see the daughters of silo come out as the
custom is to dance come ye on a sudden out of the vineyards and catch
you every man his wife among them and go into the land of benjamin
and when their fathers and their brethren shall come and shall
begin to complain against you and to chide we will say to them have
pity on them for they took them not away as by the right of war or
conquest but when they asked to have them you gave them not and the
fault was committed on your part
and the children of benjamin did as they had been commanded and
according to their number they carried off for themselves every man his
wife of them that were dancing and they went into their possession and
built up their cities and dwelt in them
the children of israel also returned by their tribes and
families to their dwellings in those days there was no king in israel
but every one did that which seemed right to himself
here recorded who being a gentile became a convert to the true faith
and marrying booz the greatgrandfather of david was one of those from
whom christ sprung according to the flesh and an illustrious figure of
the gentile church it is thought this book was written by the prophet
