and they were found two thousand six hundred and thirty
this is the people of the gersonites whom moses and aaron
numbered according to the word of the lord
the sons of merari also were numbered by the kindreds and houses

reckoned up according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of
all that were reckoned up of the levites and whom moses and aaron
and the princes of israel took by name by the kindreds and houses of
their fathers
from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old that go
into the ministry of the tabernacle and to carry the burdens
were in all eight thousand five hundred and eighty
moses reckoned them up according to the word of the lord every
one according to their office and burdens as the lord had commanded
him
satisfaction firstfruits and oblations belonging to the priests trial
of jealousy
and the lord spoke to moses saying
command the children of israel that they cast out of the camp
every leper and whosoever hath an issue of seed or is defiled by the
dead
whether it be man or woman cast ye them out of the camp lest they
defile it when i shall dwell with you
and the children of israel did so and they cast them forth without
the camp as the lord had spoken to moses
and the lord spoke to moses saying
say to the children of israel when a man or woman shall have
committed any of all the sins that men are wont to commit and by
negligence shall have transgressed the commandment of the lord and
offended
they shall confess their sin and restore the principal itself and
the fifth part over and above to him against whom they have sinned
but if there be no one to receive it they shall give it to the
expiation to be an atoning sacrifice
all the firstfruits also which the children of israel offer
belong to the priest
and whatsoever is offered into the sanctuary by every one and is
delivered into the hands of the priest it shall be his
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say to them the
man whose wife shall have gone astray and contemning her husband
shall have slept with another man and her husband cannot discover
it but the adultery is secret and cannot be proved by witnesses
because she was not found in the adultery
if the spirit of jealousy stir up the husband against his wife
who either is defiled or is charged with false suspicion
innocent and to prevent jealous husbands from doing mischief to their
wives as likewise to give all a horror of adultery by punishing it in
so remarkable a manner
he shall bring her to the priest and shall offer an oblation for
her the tenth part of a measure of barley meal he shall not pour oil
thereon nor put frankincense upon it because it is a sacrifice of
jealousy and an oblation searching out adultery
the priest therefore shall offer it and set it before the lord
and he shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and he shall
cast a little earth of the pavement of the tabernacle into it
and when the woman shall stand before the lord he shall uncover
her head and shall put on her hands the sacrifice of remembrance and
the oblation of jealousy and he himself shall hold the most bitter
waters whereon he hath heaped curses with execration
and he shall adjure her and shall say if another man hath not
slept with thee and if thou be not defiled by forsaking thy husbands
bed these most bitter waters on which i have heaped curses shall not
hurt thee
but if thou hast gone aside from thy husband and art defiled and
hast lain with another man
these curses shall light upon thee the lord make thee a curse
and an example for all among his people may he make thy thigh to rot
and may thy belly swell and burst asunder
let the cursed waters enter into thy belly and may thy womb swell
and thy thigh rot and the woman shall answer amen amen
and the priest shall write these curses in a book and shall wash
them out with the most bitter waters upon which he hath heaped the
curses
and he shall give them her to drink and when she hath drunk them
up
the priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of jealousy and
shall elevate it before the lord and shall put it upon the altar yet
so as first
to take a handful of the sacrifice of that which is offered and
burn it upon the altar and so give the most bitter waters to the woman
to drink
and when she hath drunk them if she be defiled and having
despised her husband be guilty of adultery the malediction shall go
through her and her belly swelling her thigh shall rot and the woman
shall be a curse and an example to all the people
but if she be not defiled she shall not be hurt and shall bear
children
this is the law of jealousy if a woman hath gone aside from her
husband and be defiled
and the husband stirred up by the spirit of jealousy bring her
before the lord and the priest do to her according to all things that
are here written
the husband shall be blameless and she shall bear her iniquity
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say to them when a
man or woman shall make a vow to be sanctified and will consecrate
themselves to the lord
they shall abstain from wine and from every thing that may make a
man drunk they shall not drink vinegar of wine or of any other drink
nor any thing that is pressed out of the grape nor shall they eat
grapes either fresh or dried
all the days that they are consecrated to the lord by vow they
shall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard from the raisin even to
the kernel
all the time of his separation no razor shall pass over his head
until the day be fulfilled of his consecration to the lord he shall be
holy and shall let the hair of his head grow
all the time of his consecration he shall not go in to any dead
neither shall he make himself unclean even for his father or for
his mother or for his brother or for his sister when they die
because the consecration of his god is upon his head
all the days of his separation he shall be holy to the lord
but if any man die suddenly before him the head of his
consecration shall be defiled and he shall shave it forthwith on the
same day of his purification and again on the seventh day
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles or two young
pigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant of the testimony
and the priest shall offer one for sin and the other for a
holocaust and shall pray for him for that he hath sinned by the dead
and he shall sanctify his head that day
and shall consecrate to the lord the days of his separation
offering a lamb of one year for sin yet so that the former days be made
void because his sanctification was profaned
this is the law of consecration when the days which he had
determined by vow shall be expired he shall bring him to the door of
the tabernacle of the covenant
and shall offer his oblation to the lord one he lamb of a year
old without blemish for a holocaust and one ewe lamb of a year old
without blemish for a sin offering and one ram without blemish for a
victim of peace offering
a basket also of unleavened bread tempered with oil and wafers
without leaven anointed with oil and the libations of each
and the priest shall present them before the lord and shall offer
both the sin offering and the holocaust
but the ram he shall immolate for a sacrifice of peace offering to
the lord offering at the same time the basket of unleavened bread and
the libations that are due by custom
then shall the hair of the consecration of the nazarite be shaved
off before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant and he shall take
his hair and lay it upon the fire which is under the sacrifice of the
peace offerings
and shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram and one unleavened
cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and he shall deliver
them into the hands of the nazarite after his head is shaven
and receiving them again from him he shall elevate them in the
sight of the lord and they being sanctified shall belong to the priest
as the breast which was commanded to be separated and the shoulder
this is the law of the nazarite when he hath vowed his oblation
to the lord in the time of his consecration besides those things which
his hand shall find according to that which he had vowed in his mind
so shall he do for the fulfilling of his sanctification
and the lord spoke to moses saying
say to aaron and his sons thus shall you bless the children of
the lord bless thee and keep thee
the lord shew his face to thee and have mercy on thee
the lord turn his countenance to thee and give thee peace
and they shall invoke my name upon the children of israel and i
will bless them
speaketh to moses from the propitiatory
and it came to pass in the day that moses had finished the
tabernacle and set it up and had anointed and sanctified it with all
its vessels the altar likewise and all the vessels thereof
the princes of israel and the heads of the families in every
tribe who were the rulers of them who had been numbered offered
their gifts before the lord six wagons covered and twelve oxen
before the tabernacle
and the lord said to moses
receive them from them to serve in the ministry of the tabernacle
and thou shalt deliver them to the levites according to the order of
their ministry
moses therefore receiving the wagons and the oxen delivered them
to the levites
two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of gerson according
to their necessity
the other four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of
but to the sons of caath he gave no wagons or oxen because they
serve in the sanctuary and carry their burdens upon their own shoulders
and the princes offered for the dedication of the altar on the day
when it was anointed their oblation before the altar
and the lord said to moses let each of the princes one day after
another offer their gifts for the dedication of the altar
the first day nahasson the son of aminadab of the tribe of juda
offered his offering

and when moses entered into the tabernacle of the covenant to
consult the oracle he heard the voice of one speaking to him from the
propitiatory that is over the ark between the two cherubims and from
this place he spoke to him
the loaves of proposition the ordination of the levites and to what
age they shall serve in the tabernacle
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to aaron and thou shalt say to him when thou shalt place
the seven lamps let the candlestick be set up on the south side give
orders therefore that the lamps look over against the north towards the
table of the loaves of proposition over against that part shall they
give light towards which the candlestick looketh
and aaron did so and he put the lamps upon the candlestick as the
now this was the work of the candlestick it was of beaten gold
both the shaft in the middle and all that came out of both sides of the
branches according to the pattern which the lord had shewn to moses so
he made the candlestick
and the lord spoke to moses saying
take the levites out of the midst of the children of israel and
thou shalt purify them
according to this rite let them be sprinkled with the water of
purification and let them shave all the hairs of their flesh and when
they shall have washed their garments and are cleansed
holy water mixed with the ashes of the red cow num appointed for
purifying all that were unclean it was a figure of the blood of christ
applied to our souls by his holy sacraments
they shall take an ox of the herd and for the offering thereof
fine flour tempered with oil and thou shalt take another ox of the herd
for a sin offering
and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the
covenant calling together all the multitude of the children of israel
and when the levites are before the lord the children of israel
shall put their hands upon them
and aaron shall offer the levites as a gift in the sight of the
the levites also shall put their hands upon the heads of the oxen
of which thou shalt sacrifice one for sin and the other for a holocaust
to the lord to pray for them
and thou shalt set the levites in the sight of aaron and of his
and shalt consecrate them being offered to the lord
and shalt separate them from the midst of the children of israel
to be mine
and afterwards they shall enter into the tabernacle of the
covenant to serve me and thus shalt thou purify and consecrate them
for an oblation of the lord for as a gift they were given me by the
children of israel
i have taken them instead of the firstborn that open every womb in
for all the firstborn of the children of israel both of men and
of beasts are mine from the day that i slew every firstborn in the
land of egypt have i sanctified them to myself
and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the children
of israel
and have delivered them for a gift to aaron and his sons out of
the midst of the people to serve me for israel in the tabernacle of the
covenant and to pray for them lest there should be a plague among the
people if they should presume to approach unto my sanctuary
and moses and aaron and all the multitude of the children of
and they were purified and washed their garments and aaron
lifted them up in the sight of the lord and prayed for them
that being purified they might go into the tabernacle of the
covenant to do their services before aaron and his sons as the lord had
commanded moses touching the levites so was it done
and the lord spoke to moses saying
this is the law of the levites from twentyfive years old and
upwards they shall go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant
and when they shall have accomplished the fiftieth year of their
age they shall cease to serve
and they shall be the ministers of their brethren in the
tabernacle of the covenant to keep the things that are committed to
their care but not to do the works thus shalt thou order the levites
touching their charge
observe it the second month the camp is guided by the pillar of the
cloud
the lord spoke to moses in the desert of sinai the second year
after they were come out of the land of egypt in the first month
saying
let the children of israel make the phase in its due time
paschal lamb
the fourteenth day of this month in the evening according to all
the ceremonies and justifications thereof
and moses commanded the children of israel that they should make
the phase
and they made it in its proper time the fourteenth day of the
month at evening in mount sinai the children of israel did according
to all things that the lord had commanded moses
but behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man
who could not make the phase on that day coming to moses and aaron
soul was departed
said to them we are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man why
are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the
and moses answered them stay that i may consult the lord what he
will ordain concerning you
and the lord spoke to moses saying
say to the children of israel the man that shall be unclean by
occasion of one that is dead or shall be in a journey afar off in your
nation let him make the phase to the lord
in the second month on the fourteenth day of the month in the
evening they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce
they shall not leave any thing thereof until morning nor break a
bone thereof they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase
but if any man is clean and was not on a journey and did not
make the phase that soul shall be cut off from among his people
because he offered not sacrifice to the lord in due season he shall
bear his sin
the sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you shall
make the phase to the lord according to the ceremonies and
justifications thereof the same ordinances shall be with you both for
the stranger and for him that was born in the land
now on the day that the tabernacle was reared up a cloud covered
it but from the evening there was over the tabernacle as it were the
appearance of fire until the morning
so it was always by day the cloud covered it and by night as it
were the appearance of fire
and when the cloud that covered the tabernacle was taken up then
the children of israel marched forward and in the place where the cloud
stood still there they camped
at the commandment of the lord they marched and at his
commandment they pitched the tabernacle all the days that the cloud
abode over the tabernacle they remained in the same place
and if it was so that it continued over it a long time the
children of israel kept the watches of the lord and marched not
for as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle
commandment they took them down
if the cloud tarried from evening until morning and immediately
at break of day left the tabernacle they marched forward and if it
departed after a day and a night they took down their tents
but if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or
a longer time the children of israel remained in the same place and
marched not but immediately as soon as it departed they removed the
camp
by the word of the lord they pitched their tents and by his word
they marched and kept the watches of the lord according to his
commandment by the hand of moses
and the lord spoke to moses saying
make thee two trumpets of beaten silver wherewith thou mayest
call together the multitude when the camp is to be removed
and when thou shalt sound the trumpets all the multitude shall
gather unto thee to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant
if thou sound but once the princes and the heads of the multitude
of israel shall come to thee
but if the sound of the trumpets be longer and with
interruptions they that are on the east side shall first go forward
and at the second sounding and like noise of the trumpet they who
lie on the south side shall take up their tents and after this manner
shall the rest do when the trumpets shall sound for a march
but when the people is to be gathered together the sound of the
trumpets shall be plain and they shall not make a broken sound
and the sons of aaron the priest shall sound the trumpets and
this shall be an ordinance for ever in your generations
if you go forth to war out of your land against the enemies that
fight against you you shall sound aloud with the trumpets and there
shall be a remembrance of you before the lord your god that you may be
delivered out of the hands of your enemies
if at any time you shall have a banquet and on your festival
days and on the first days of your months you shall sound the trumpets
over the holocausts and the sacrifices of peace offerings that they
may be to you for a remembrance of your god i am the lord your god
the second year in the second month the twentieth day of the
month the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the covenant
and the children of israel marched by their troops from the
desert of sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of pharan
and the first went forward according to the commandment of the
the sons of juda by their troops whose prince was nahasson the
son of aminadab
in the tribe of the sons of issachar the prince was nathanael
the son of suar
in the tribe of zabulon the prince was eliab the son of helon
and the tabernacle was taken down and the sons of gerson and
and the sons of ruben also marched by their troops and ranks
whose prince was helisur the son of sedeur
and in the tribe of simeon the prince was salamiel the son of
and in the tribe of gad the prince was eliasaph the son of duel
then the caathites also marched carrying the sanctuary so long
was the tabernacle carried till they came to the place of setting it
up
the sons of ephraim also moved their camp by their troops in
whose army the prince was elisama the son of ammiud
and in the tribe of the sons of manasses the prince was gamaliel
the son of phadassur
and in the tribe of benjamin the prince was abidan the son of
the last of all the camp marched the sons of dan by their troops
in whose army the prince was ahiezer the son of ammisaddai
and in the tribe of the sons of aser the prince was phegiel the
son of ochran
and in the tribe of the sons of nephtali the prince was ahira
the son of enan
this was the order of the camps and marches of the children of
and moses said to hobab the son of raguel the madianite his
kinsman we are going towards the place which the lord will give us
come with us that we may do thee good for the lord hath promised good
things to israel
but he answered him i will not go with thee but i will return
to my country wherein i was born
and he said do not leave us for thou knowest in what places we
should encamp in the wilderness and thou shalt be our guide
and if thou comest with us we will give thee what is the best of
the riches which the lord shall deliver to us
so they marched from the mount of the lord three days journey
and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them for three days
providing a place for the camp
the cloud also of the lord was over them by day when they
marched
and when the ark was lifted up moses said arise o lord and
let thy enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee from
before thy face
and when it was set down he said return o lord to the
multitude of the host of israel
ancients for assistants to moses they prophesy the people have their
fill of flesh but forthwith many die of the plague
in the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people against the
he was angry and the fire of the lord being kindled against them
devoured them that were at the uttermost part of the camp
and when the people cried to moses moses prayed to the lord and
the fire was swallowed up
and he called the name of that place the burning for that the
fire of the lord had been kindled against them
for a mixt multitude of people that came up with them burned
with desire sitting and weeping the children of israel also being
joined with them and said who shall give us flesh to eat
who were not of the race of israel who by their murmuring drew also
the children of israel to murmur this should teach us the danger of
associating ourselves with the children of egypt that is with the
lovers and admirers of this wicked world
we remember the fish that we ate in egypt free cost the cucumbers
come into our mind and the melons and the leeks and the onions and
the garlic
our soul is dry our eyes behold nothing else but manna
now the manna was like coriander seed of the colour of bdellium
of a mans nail white and bright
and the people went about and gathering it ground it in a mill
or beat it in a mortar and boiled it in a pot and made cakes thereof
of the taste of bread tempered with oil
and when the dew fell in the night upon the camp the manna also
fell with it
now moses heard the people weeping by their families every one
at the door of his tent and the wrath of the lord was exceedingly
enkindled to moses also the thing seemed insupportable
and he said to the lord why hast thou afflicted thy servant
weight of all this people upon me
have i conceived all this multitude or begotten them that thou
shouldst say to me carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to
carry the little infant and bear them into the land for which thou
hast sworn to their fathers
whence should i have flesh to give to so great a multitude they
weep against me saying give us flesh that we may eat
i am not able alone to bear all this people because it is too
heavy for me
but if it seem unto thee otherwise i beseech thee to kill me
and let me find grace in thy eyes that i be not afflicted with so great
evils
and the lord said to moses gather unto me seventy men of the
ancients of israel whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the
people and thou shalt bring them to the door of the tabernacle of the
covenant and shalt make them stand there with thee
called the sanhedrin consisting of seventy or seventytwo senators or
counsellors
that i may come down and speak with thee and i will take of thy
spirit and will give to them that they may bear with thee the burden
of the people and thou mayest not be burthened alone
and thou shalt say to the people be ye sanctified to morrow you
shall eat flesh for i have heard you say who will give us flesh to
eat it was well with us in egypt that the lord may give you flesh and
you may eat
not for one day nor two nor five nor ten no nor for twenty
but even for a month of days till it come out at your nostrils
and become loathsome to you because you have cast off the lord who is
in the midst of you and have wept before him saying why came we out
of egypt
and moses said there are six hundred thousand footmen of this
people and sayest thou i will give them flesh to eat a whole month
shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed that it may
suffice for their food or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered
together to fill them
and the lord answered him is the hand of the lord unable thou
shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no
moses therefore came and told the people the words of the lord
and assembled seventy men of the ancients of israel and made them to
stand about the tabernacle
and the lord came down in a cloud and spoke to him taking away
of the spirit that was in moses and giving to the seventy men and when
the spirit had rested on them they prophesied nor did they cease
afterwards
now there remained in the camp two of the men of whom one was
called eldad and the other medad upon whom the spirit rested for they
also had been enrolled but were not gone forth to the tabernacle
and when they prophesied in the camp there ran a young man and
told moses saying eldad and medad prophesy in the camp
forthwith josue the son of nun the minister of moses and chosen
out of many said my lord moses forbid them
but he said why hast thou emulation for me o that all the
people might prophesy and that the lord would give them his spirit
and moses returned with the ancients of israel into the camp
and a wind going out from the lord taking quails up beyond the
sea brought them and cast them into the camp for the space of one days
journey on every side of the camp round about and they flew in the air
two cubits high above the ground
the people therefore rising up all that day and night and the
next day gathered together of quails he that did least ten cores and
they dried them round about the camp
as yet the flesh was between their teeth neither had that kind
of meat failed when behold the wrath of the lord being provoked against
the people struck them with an exceeding great plague
and that place was called the graves of lust for there they
buried the people that had lusted and departing from the graves of
lust they came unto haseroth and abode there
from their irregular desire of flesh in hebrew kibroth hattaavah
prophets mary being struck with leprosy aaron confesseth his fault
she is restored
and mary and aaron spoke against moses because of his wife the
upon the land of chus or ethiopia where note that the ethiopia here
spoken of is not that of africa but that of arabia
and they said hath the lord spoken by moses only hath he not
also spoken to us in like manner and when the lord heard this
for moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon
earth
himself therefore god inspired him to write here his own defence and
the holy spirit whose dictate he wrote obliged him to declare the
truth though it was so much to his own praise
immediately he spoke to him and to aaron and mary come out you
three only to the tabernacle of the covenant and when they were come
out
the lord came down in a pillar of the cloud and stood in the
entry of the tabernacle calling to aaron and mary and when they were
come
he said to them hear my words if there be among you a prophet of
the lord i will appear to him in a vision or i will speak to him in a
dream
but it is not so with my servant moses who is most faithful in all
my house
for i speak to him mouth to mouth and plainly and not by riddles
and figures doth he see the lord why then were you not afraid to speak
ill of my servant moses
and being angry with them he went away
the cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed and behold
her and saw her all covered with leprosy
he said to moses i beseech thee my lord lay not upon us this
sin which we have foolishly committed
let her not be as one dead and as an abortive that is cast forth
from the mothers womb lo now one half of her flesh is consumed with
the leprosy
and moses cried to the lord saying o god i beseech thee heal
her
and the lord answered him if her father had spitten upon her
face ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least let
her be separated seven days without the camp and afterwards she shall
be called again
mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days and the people
moved not from that place until mary was called again
it
and the people marched from haseroth and pitched their tents in
the desert of pharan
and there the lord spoke to moses saying
send men to view the land of chanaan which i will give to the
children of israel one of every tribe of the rulers
moses did what the lord had commanded sending from the desert of
of the tribe of ruben sammua the son of zechur
of the tribe of simeon saphat the son of huri
of the tribe of juda caleb the son of jephone
of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph
of the tribe of ephraim osee the son of nun
of the tribe of benjamin phalti the son of raphu
of the tribe of zabulon geddiel the son of sodi
of the tribe of joseph of the sceptre of manasses gaddi the son
of susi
of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli
of the tribe of aser sthur the son of michael
of the tribe of nephtali nahabi the son of vapsi
of the tribe of gad guel the son of machi
these are the names of the men whom moses sent to view the land
and he called osee the son of nun josue
and moses sent them to view the land of chanaan and said to
them go you up by the south side and when you shall come to the
mountains
view the land of what sort it is and the people that are the
inhabitants thereof whether they be strong or weak few in number or
many
the land itself whether it be good or bad what manner of
cities walled or without walls
the ground fat or barren woody or without trees be of good
courage and bring us of the fruits of the land now it was the time
when the firstripe grapes are fit to be eaten
and when they were gone up they viewed the land from the desert
of sin unto rohob as you enter into emath
and they went up at the south side and came to hebron where
were achiman and sisai and tholmai the sons of enac for hebron was
built seven years before tanis the city of egypt
and forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes they
cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes which two men carried upon
a lever they took also of the pomegranates and of the figs of that
place
which was called nehelescol that is to say the torrent of the
cluster of grapes because from thence the children of israel had
carried a cluster of grapes
and they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days
having gone round all the country
and came to moses and aaron and to all the assembly of the
children of israel to the desert of pharan which is in cades and
speaking to them and to all the multitude they shewed them the fruits
of the land
and they related and said we came into the land to which thou
sentest us which in very deed floweth with milk and honey as may be
known by these fruits
but it hath very strong inhabitants and the cities are great and
walled we saw there the race of enac
amalec dwelleth in the south the hethite and the jebusite and
the amorrhite in the mountains but the chanaanite abideth by the sea
and near the streams of the jordan
in the mean time caleb to still the murmuring of the people that
rose against moses said let us go up and possess the land for we
shall be able to conquer it
but the others that had been with him said no we are not able
to go up to this people because they are stronger than we
and they spoke ill of the land which they had viewed before the
children of israel saying the land which we have viewed devoureth its
inhabitants the people that we beheld are of a tall stature
of promise discouraged the israelites from attempting the conquest of
it were a figure of worldlings who by decrying or misrepresenting
true devotion discourage christians from seeking in earnest and
acquiring so great a good and thereby securing to themselves a happy
eternity
there we saw certain monsters of the sons of enac of the giant
kind in comparison of whom we seemed like locusts
land the authors of the sedition are struck dead the rest going to
fight against the will of god are beaten
therefore the whole multitude crying wept that night
and all the children of israel murmured against moses and aaron
saying
would god that we had died in egypt and would god we may die in
this vast wilderness and that the lord may not bring us into this land
lest we fall by the sword and our wives and children be led away
captives is it not better to return into egypt
and they said one to another let us appoint a captain and let us
return into egypt
and when moses and aaron heard this they fell down flat upon the
ground before the multitude of the children of israel
but josue the son of nun and caleb the son of jephone who
themselves also had viewed the land rent their garments
and said to all the multitude of the children of israel the land
which we have gone round is very good
if the lord be favourable he will bring us into it and give us a
land flowing with milk and honey
be not rebellious against the lord and fear ye not the people of
this land for we are able to eat them up as bread all aid is gone from
them the lord is with us fear ye not
and when all the multitude cried out and would have stoned them
the glory of the lord appeared over the tabernacle of the covenant to
all the children of israel
and the lord said to moses how long will this people detract me
how long will they not believe me for all the signs that i have wrought
before them
i will strike them therefore with pestilence and will consume
them but thee i will make a ruler over a great nation and a mightier
than this is
and moses said to the lord that the egyptians from the midst of
whom thou hast brought forth this people
and the inhabitants of this land who have heard that thou o
protecteth them and thou goest before them in a pillar of a cloud by
day and in a pillar of fire by night
may hear that thou hast killed so great a multitude as it were
one man and may say
he could not bring the people into the land for which he had
sworn therefore did he kill them in the wilderness
let then the strength of the lord be magnified as thou hast
sworn saying
the lord is patient and full of mercy by taking away iniquity
and wickedness and leaving no man clear who visitest the sins of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation
forgive i beseech thee the sins of this people according to
the greatness of thy mercy as thou hast been merciful to them from
their going out of egypt unto this place
and the lord said i have forgiven according to thy word
as i live and the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of
the lord
but yet all the men that have seen my majesty and the signs that
times and have not obeyed my voice
shall not see the land for which i swore to their fathers
neither shall any one of them that hath detracted me behold it
my servant caleb who being full of another spirit hath followed
me i will bring into this land which he hath gone round and his seed
shall possess it
for the amalecite and the chanaanite dwell in the valleys to
morrow remove the camp and return into the wilderness by the way of the
and the lord spoke to moses and aaron saying
how long doth this wicked multitude murmur against me i have
heard the murmurings of the children of israel
say therefore to them as i live saith the lord according as
you have spoken in my hearing so will i do to you
in the wilderness shall your carcasses lie all you that were
numbered from twenty years old and upward and have murmured against me
shall not enter into the land over which i lifted up my hand to
make you dwell therein except caleb the son of jephone and josue the
son of nun
but your children of whom you said that they should be a prey
to the enemies will i bring in that they may see the land which you
have despised
your carcasses shall lie in the wilderness
your children shall wander in the desert forty years and shall
bear your fornication until the carcasses of their fathers be consumed
in the desert
your disloyalty to god which in the scripture language is here called a
fornication in a spiritual sense
according to the number of the forty days wherein you viewed the
land a year shall be counted for a day and forty years you shall
receive your iniquities and shall know my revenge
for as i have spoken so will i do to all this wicked multitude
that hath risen up together against me in this wilderness shall it
faint away and die
therefore all the men whom moses had sent to view the land and
who at their return had made the whole multitude to murmur against him
speaking ill of the land that it was naught
died and were struck in the sight of the lord
but josue the son of nun and caleb had gone to view the land
and moses spoke all these words to all the children of israel
and the people mourned exceedingly
and behold rising up very early in the morning they went up to
the top of the mountain and said we are ready to go up to the place
of which the lord hath spoken for we have sinned
and moses said to them why transgress you the word of the lord
which shall not succeed prosperously with you
go not up for the lord is not with you lest you fall before
your enemies
the amalecite and the chanaanite are before you and by their
sword you shall fall because you would not consent to the lord neither
will the lord be with you
but they being blinded went up to the top of the mountain but
the ark of the testament of the lord and moses departed not from the
camp
and the amalecite came down and the chanaanite that dwelt in the
mountain and smiting and slaying them pursued them as far as horma
death the law of fringes on their garments
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say to them when
you shall be come unto the land of your habitation which i will give
you
and shall make an offering to the lord for a holocaust or a
victim paying your vows or voluntarily offering gifts or in your
solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the lord of oxen or of sheep
whosoever immolateth the victim shall offer a sacrifice of fine
flour the tenth part of an ephi tempered with the fourth part of a hin
of oil
and he shall give the same measure of wine to pour out in
libations for the holocaust or for the victim for every lamb
and for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of flour of two
tenths which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of oil
and he shall offer the third part the same measure of wine for the
libation for a sweet savour to the lord
but when thou offerest a holocaust or sacrifice of oxen to fulfil
thy vow or for victims of peace offerings
thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour tempered with
half a hin of oil
and wine for libations of the same measure for an offering of
most sweet savour to the lord
thus shalt thou do
for every ox and ram and lamb and kid
both they that are born in the land and the strangers
shall offer sacrifices after the same rite
there shall be all one law and judgment both for you and for them
who are strangers in the land
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say to them
when you are come into the land which i will give you
and shall eat of the bread of that country you shall separate
firstfruits to the lord
of the things you eat as you separate firstfruits of your
barnfloors
so also shall you give firstfruits of your dough to the lord
and if through ignorance you omit any of these things which the
and by him hath commanded you from the day that he began to
command and thenceforward
and the multitude have forgotten to do it they shall offer a
calf out of the herd a holocaust for a most sweet savour to the lord
and the sacrifice and libations thereof as the ceremonies require and
a buck goat for sin
and the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children
of israel and it shall be forgiven them because they sinned
ignorantly offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the lord for
themselves and for their sin and their ignorance
and it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of
fault of all the people through ignorance
but if one soul shall sin ignorantly he shall offer a shegoat
of a year old for his sin
and the priest shall pray for him because he sinned ignorantly
before the lord and he shall obtain his pardon and it shall be
forgiven him
the same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance whether they
be natives or strangers
but the soul that committeth any thing through pride whether he
be born in the land or a stranger because he hath been rebellious
against the lord shall be cut off from among his people
for he hath contemned the word of the lord and made void his
precept therefore shall he be destroyed and shall bear his iniquity
and it came to pass when the children of israel were in the
wilderness and had found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day
that they brought him to moses and aaron and the whole multitude
and they put him into prison not knowing what they should do
with him
and the lord said to moses let that man die let all the
multitude stone him without the camp
and when they had brought him out they stoned him and he died
as the lord had commanded
the lord also said to moses
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt tell them to make
to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments putting in them
ribands of blue
to appear more zealous than other men for the law of god
that when they shall see them they may remember all the
commandments of the lord and not follow their own thoughts and eyes
going astray after divers things
but rather being mindful of the precepts of the lord may do them
and be holy to their god
i am the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt
that i might be your god
and behold core the son of isaar the son of caath the son of
rose up against moses and with them two hundred and fifty others
of the children of israel leading men of the synagogue and who in the
time of assembly were called by name
manner was that of schism and of rebellion against the authority
established by god in the church and their pretending to the priesthood
without being lawfully called and sent the same is the case of all
modern sectaries
and when they had stood up against moses and aaron they said let
it be enough for you that all the multitude consisteth of holy ones
and the lord is among them why lift you up yourselves above the people
of the lord
when moses heard this he fell flat on his face
and speaking to core and all the multitude he said in the
morning the lord will make known who belong to him and the holy he will
join to himself and whom he shall choose they shall approach to him
do this therefore take every man of you your censers thou core
and all thy company
and putting fire in them to morrow put incense upon it before the
too much upon you ye sons of levi
and he said again to core hear ye sons of levi
is it a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath spared
you from all the people and joined you to himself that you should
serve him in the service of the tabernacle and should stand before the
congregation of the people and should minister to him
did he therefore make thee and all thy brethren the sons of levi
to approach unto him that you should challenge to yourselves the
priesthood also
and that all thy company should stand against the lord for what
is aaron that you murmur against him
then moses sent to call dathan and abiron the sons of eliab but
they answered we will not come
is it a small matter to thee that thou hast brought us out of a
land that flowed with milk and honey to kill us in the desert except
thou rule also like a lord over us
thou hast brought us indeed into a land that floweth with rivers
of milk and honey and hast given us possessions of fields and
vineyards wilt thou also pull out our eyes we will not come
moses therefore being very angry said to the lord respect not
their sacrifices thou knowest that i have not taken of them so much as
a young ass at any time nor have injured any of them
the affront offered to god like that which the same holy prophet
conceived upon the sight of the golden calf ex
and he said to core do thou and thy congregation stand apart
before the lord to morrow and aaron apart
take every one of you censers and put incense upon them
offering to the lord two hundred and fifty censers let aaron also hold
his censer
when they had done this moses and aaron standing
and had drawn up all the multitude against them to the door of
the tabernacle the glory of the lord appeared to them all
and the lord speaking to moses and aaron said
separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may
presently destroy them
they fell flat on their face and said o most mighty the god of
the spirits of all flesh for one mans sin shall thy wrath rage against
all
and the lord said to moses
command the whole people to separate themselves from the tents of
and moses arose and went to dathan and abiron and the ancients
of israel following him
he said to the multitude depart from the tents of these wicked
men and touch nothing of theirs lest you be involved in their sins
and when they were departed from their tents round about dathan
and abiron coming out stood in the entry of their pavilions with their
wives and children and all the people
and moses said by this you shall know that the lord hath sent me
to do all things that you see and that i have not forged them of my own
head
if these men die the common death of men and if they be visited
with a plague wherewith others also are wont to be visited the lord
did not send me
but if the lord do a new thing and the earth opening her mouth
swallow them down and all things that belong to them and they go down
alive into hell you shall know that they have blasphemed the lord
and immediately as he had made an end of speaking the earth
broke asunder under their feet
and opening her mouth devoured them with their tents and all
their substance
and they went down alive into hell the ground closing upon them
and they perished from among the people
but all israel that was standing round about fled at the cry of
them that were perishing saying lest perhaps the earth swallow us up
also
and a fire coming out from the lord destroyed the two hundred
and fifty men that offered the incense
and the lord spoke to moses saying
command eleazar the son of aaron the priest to take up the
censers that lie in the burning and to scatter the fire of one side and
the other because they are sanctified
in the deaths of the sinners and let him beat them into plates
and fasten them to the altar because incense hath been offered in them
to the lord and they are sanctified that the children of israel may
see them for a sign and a memorial
then eleazar the priest took the brazen censers wherein they had
offered whom the burning fire had devoured and beat them into plates
fastening them to the altar
that the children of israel might have for the time to come
wherewith they should be admonished that no stranger or any one that is
not of the seed of aaron should come near to offer incense to the lord
lest he should suffer as core suffered and all his congregation
according as the lord spoke to moses
the following day all the multitude of the children of israel
murmured against moses and aaron saying you have killed the people of
the lord
and when there arose a sedition and the tumult increased
moses and aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant and when
they were gone into it the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord
appeared
and the lord said to moses
get you out from the midst of this multitude this moment will i
destroy them and as they were lying on the ground
moses said to aaron take the censer and putting fire in it from
the altar put incense upon it and go quickly to the people to pray for
them for already wrath is gone out from the lord and the plague
rageth
when aaron had done this and had run to the midst of the
multitude which the burning fire was now destroying he offered the
incense
and standing between the dead and the living he prayed for the
people and the plague ceased
and the number of them that were slain was fourteen thousand and
seven hundred men besides them that had perished in the sedition of
and aaron returned to moses to the door of the tabernacle of the
covenant after the destruction was over
his rod which is kept for a monument in the tabernacle
and the lord spoke to moses saying
speak to the children of israel and take of every one of them a
rod by their kindreds of all the princes of the tribes twelve rods
and write the name of every man upon his rod
and the name of aaron shall be for the tribe of levi and one rod
shall contain all their families
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the covenant
before the testimony where i will speak to thee
whomsoever of these i shall choose his rod shall blossom and i
will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel
wherewith they murmur against you
and moses spoke to the children of israel and all the princes
gave him rods one for every tribe and there were twelve rods besides
the rod of aaron
and when moses had laid them up before the lord in the tabernacle
of the testimony
he returned on the following day and found that the rod of aaron
for the house of levi was budded and that the buds swelling it hid
bloomed blossoms which spreading the leaves were formed into almonds
blessed virgin conceiving and bringing forth her son without any
prejudice to her virginity
moses therefore brought out all the rods from before the lord to
all the children of israel and they saw and every one received their
rods
and the lord said to moses carry back the rod of aaron into the
tabernacle of the testimony that it may be kept there for a token of
the rebellious children of israel and that their complaints may cease
from me lest they die
and moses did as the lord had commanded
and the children of israel said to moses behold we are consumed
we all perish
whosoever approacheth to the tabernacle of the lord he dieth
and the lord said to aaron thou and thy sons and thy fathers
house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and
thy sons with thee shall bear the sins of your priesthood
sanctuary that is you shall be punished if through negligence or
want of due attention you err in the discharge of the sacred functions
for which you were ordained
and take with thee thy brethren also of the tribe of levi and the
sceptre of thy father and let them be ready in hand and minister to
thee but thou and thy sons shall minister in the tabernacle of the
testimony
and the levites shall watch to do thy commands and about all the
works of the tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of
the sanctuary nor the altar lest both they die and you also perish
with them
but let them be with thee and watch in the charge of the
tabernacle and in all the ceremonies thereof a stranger shall not join
himself with you
watch ye in the charge of the sanctuary and in the ministry of
the altar lest indignation rise upon the children of israel
i have given you your brethren the levites from among the children
of israel and have delivered them for a gift to the lord to serve in
the ministries of the tabernacle
but thou and thy sons look ye to the priesthood and all things
that pertain to the service of the altar and that are within the veil
shall be executed by the priests if any stranger shall approach he
shall be slain
and the lord said to aaron behold i have given thee the charge of
my firstfruits all things that are sanctified by the children of
office by everlasting ordinances
these therefore shalt thou take of the things that are sanctified
and are offered to the lord every offering and sacrifice and
whatsoever is rendered to me for sin and for trespass and becometh holy
of holies shall be for thee and thy sons
thou shalt eat it in the sanctuary the males only shall eat
thereof because it is a consecrated thing to thee
but the firstfruits which the children of israel shall vow and
offer i have given to thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters by a
perpetual law he that is clean in thy house shall eat them
all the best of the oil and of the wine and of the corn
whatsoever firstfruits they offer to the lord i have given them to
thee
all the firstripe of the fruits that the ground bringeth forth
and which are brought to the lord shall be for thy use he that is
clean in thy house shall eat them
every thing that the children of israel shall give by vow shall
be thine
whatsoever is firstborn of all flesh which they offer to the
the firstborn of man thou shalt take a price and every beast that is
unclean thou shalt cause to be redeemed
and the redemption of it shall be after one month for five
sicles of silver by the weight of the sanctuary a sicle hath twenty
obols
but the firstling of a cow and of a sheep and of a goat thou
shalt not cause to be redeemed because they are sanctified to the lord
shalt burn for a most sweet odour to the lord
but the flesh shall fall to thy use as the consecrated breast
and the right shoulder shall be thine
all the firstfruits of the sanctuary which the children of israel
offer to the lord i have given to thee and to thy sons and daughters
by a perpetual ordinance it is a covenant of salt for ever before the
covenant not to be altered or corrupted as salt is used to keep things
from corruption a covenant perpetual like that by which it was
appointed that salt should be used in every sacrifice lev
and the lord said to aaron you shall possess nothing in their
land neither shall you have a portion among them i am thy portion and
inheritance in the midst of the children of israel
and i have given to the sons of levi all the tithes of israel for
a possession for the ministry wherewith they serve me in the tabernacle
of the covenant
that the children of israel may not approach any more to the
tabernacle nor commit deadly sin
but only the sons of levi may serve me in the tabernacle and
bear the sins of the people it shall be an everlasting ordinance in
your generations they shall not possess any other thing
but be content with the oblation or tithes which i have
separated for their uses and necessities
and the lord spoke to moses saying
command the levites and declare unto them when you shall
receive of the children of israel the tithes which i have given you
offer the firstfruits of them to the lord that is to say the tenth
part of the tenth
that it may be reckoned to you as an oblation of firstfruits as
well of the barnfloors as of the winepresses
and of all the things of which you receive tithes offer the
firstfruits to the lord and give them to aaron the priest
all the things that you shall offer of the tithes and shall
separate for the gifts of the lord shall be the best and choicest
things
and thou shalt say to them if you offer all the goodly and the
better things of the tithes it shall be reckoned to you as if you had
given the firstfruits of the barnfloor and the winepress
and you shall eat them in all your places both you and your
families because it is your reward for the ministry wherewith you
serve in the tabernacle of the testimony
and you shall not sin in this point by reserving the choicest
and fat things to yourselves lest you profane the oblations of the
children of israel and die
and the lord spoke to moses and aaron saying
this is the observance of the victim which the lord hath
ordained command the children of israel that they bring unto thee a
red cow of full age in which there is no blemish and which hath not
carried the yoke
consumed with fire without the camp with the ashes of which mingled
with water the unclean were to be expiated and purified was a figure
of the passion of christ by whose precious blood applied to our souls
in the holy sacraments we are cleansed from our sins
and you shall deliver her to eleazar the priest who shall bring
her forth without the camp and shall immolate her in the sight of all
and dipping his finger in her blood shall sprinkle it over
against the door of the tabernacle seven times
and shall burn her in the sight of all delivering up to the fire
her skin and her flesh and her blood and her dung
the priest shall also take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet
twice dyed and cast it into the flame with which the cow is consumed
and then after washing his garments and body he shall enter into
the camp and shall be unclean until the evening
he also that hath burned her shall wash his garments and his
body and shall be unclean until the evening
and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow and
shall pour them forth without the camp in a most clean place that they
may be reserved for the multitude of the children of israel and for a
water of aspersion because the cow was burnt for sin
and when he that carried the ashes of the cow hath washed his
garments he shall be unclean until the evening the children of israel
and the strangers that dwell among them shall observe this for a holy
thing by a perpetual ordinance
he that toucheth the corpse of a man and is therefore unclean
seven days
shall be sprinkled with this water on the third day and on the
seventh and so shall be cleansed if he were not sprinkled on the third
day he cannot be cleansed on the seventh
every one that toucheth the corpse of a man and is not sprinkled
with this mixture shall profane the tabernacle of the lord and shall
perish out of israel because he was not sprinkled with the water of
expiation he shall be unclean and his uncleanness shall remain upon
him
this is the law of a man that dieth in a tent all that go into
his tent and all the vessels that are there shall be unclean seven
days
the vessel that hath no cover nor binding over it shall be
unclean
if any man in the field touch the corpse of a man that was slain
or that died of himself or his bone or his grave he shall be unclean
seven days
and they shall take of the ashes of the burning and of the sin
offering and shall pour living waters upon them into a vessel
and a man that is clean shall dip hyssop in them and shall
sprinkle therewith all the tent and all the furniture and the men that
are defiled with touching any such thing
and in this manner he that is clean shall purify the unclean on
the third and on the seventh day and being expiated the seventh day he
shall wash both himself and his garments and be unclean until the
evening
if any man be not expiated after this rite his soul shall perish
out of the midst of the church because he hath profaned the sanctuary
of the lord and was not sprinkled with the water of purification
this precept shall be an ordinance for ever he also that
sprinkled the water shall wash his garments every one that shall touch
the waters of expiation shall be unclean until the evening
whatsoever a person toucheth who is unclean he shall make it
unclean and the person that toucheth any of these things shall be
unclean until the evening
water god giveth it them from the rock the death of aaron
and the children of israel and all the multitude came into the
desert of sin in the first month and the people abode in cades and
and the people wanting water came together against moses and
and making a sedition they said would god we had perished among
our brethren before the lord
why have you brought out the church of the lord into the
wilderness that both we and our cattle should die
why have you made us come up out of egypt and have brought us
into this wretched place which cannot be sowed nor bringeth forth figs
nor vines nor pomegranates neither is there any water to drink
and moses and aaron leaving the multitude went into the
tabernacle of the covenant and fell flat upon the ground and cried to
the lord and said o lord god hear the cry of this people and open to
them thy treasure a fountain of living water that being satisfied
they may cease to murmur and the glory of the lord appeared over them
and the lord spoke to moses saying
take the rod and assemble the people together thou and aaron thy
brother and speak to the rock before them and it shall yield waters
multitude and their cattle shall drink
moses therefore took the rod which was before the lord as he had
commanded him
and having gathered together the multitude before the rock he
said to them hear ye rebellious and incredulous can we bring you
forth water out of this rock
and when moses bad lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice
with the rod there came forth water in great abundance so that the
people and their cattle drank
out from the rock of his precious blood the source of all our good
and the lord said to moses and aaron because you have not
believed me to sanctify me before the children of israel you shall not
bring these people into the land which i will give them
occasion was a certain diffidence and weakness of faith not doubting
of gods power or veracity but apprehending the unworthiness of that
rebellious and incredulous people and therefore speaking with some
ambiguity
this is the water of contradiction where the children of israel
strove with words against the lord and he was sanctified in them
in the mean time moses sent messengers from cades to the king of
that hath come upon us
in what manner our fathers went down into egypt and there we
dwelt a long time and the egyptians afflicted us and our fathers
and how we cried to the lord and he heard us and sent an angel
who hath brought us out of egypt lo we are now in the city of cades
which is in the uttermost of thy borders
and we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass through thy
country we will not go through the fields nor through the vineyards
we will not drink the waters of thy wells but we will go by the common
highway neither turning aside to the right hand nor to the left till
we are past thy borders
and edom answered them thou shalt not pass by me if thou dost i
will come out armed against thee
and the children of israel said we will go by the beaten way
and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters we will give thee what is
just there shall be no difficulty in the price only let us pass
speedily
but he answered thou shalt not pass and immediately he came
forth to meet them with an infinite multitude and a strong hand
neither would he condescend to their desire to grant them passage
through his borders wherefore israel turned another way from him
and when they had removed the camp from cades they came to mount
where the lord spoke to moses
let aaron saith he go to his people for he shall not go into
the land which i have given the children of israel because he was
incredulous to my words at the waters of contradiction
take aaron and his son with him and bring them up into mount
and when thou hast stripped the father of his vesture thou shalt
vest therewith eleazar his son aaron shall be gathered to his people
and die there
moses did as the lord had commanded and they went up into mount
and when he had stripped aaron of his vestments he vested
and aaron being dead in the top of the mountain he came down
with eleazar
and all the multitude seeing that aaron was dead mourned for him
thirty days throughout all their families
serpents they are healed by the brazen serpent they conquer the kings
and when king arad the chanaanite who dwelt towards the south
had heard this to wit that israel was come by the way of the spies he
fought against them and overcoming them carried off their spoils
but israel binding himself by vow to the lord said if thou wilt
deliver thus people into my hand i will utterly destroy their cities
and the lord heard the prayers of israel and delivered up the
called the name of that place horma that is to say anathema
and they marched from mount hor by the way that leadeth to the
of their journey and labour
and speaking against god and moses they said why didst thou
bring us out of egypt to die in the wilderness there is no bread nor
have we any waters our soul now loatheth this very light food
loathe the things of heaven for which they have no relish
wherefore the lord sent among the people fiery serpents which bit
them and killed many of them
them were burnt with a violent heat
upon which they came to moses and said we have sinned because
we have spoken against the lord and thee pray that he may take away
these serpents from us and moses prayed for the people
and the lord said to him make a brazen serpent and set it up for
a sign whosoever being struck shall look on it shall live
moses therefore made a brazen serpent and set it up for a sign
which when they that were bitten looked upon they were healed
efficacy of a lively faith in him against the bites of the hellish
serpent john
and the children of israel setting forwards camped in oboth
and departing thence they pitched their tents in jeabarim in the
wilderness that faceth moab toward the east
and removing from thence they came to the torrent zared
which they left and encamped over against arnon which is in the
desert and standeth out on the borders of the amorrhite for arnon is
the border of moab dividing the moabites and the amorrhites
wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord as he
did in the red sea so will he do in the streams of arnon
quoted in scripture has been lost
the rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might rest in
when they went from that place the well appeared whereof the
water
then israel sung this song let the well spring up they sung
thereto
the well which the princes dug and the chiefs of the people
prepared by the direction of the lawgiver and with their staves and
they marched from the wilderness to mathana
from mathana unto nahaliel from nahaliel unto bamoth
from bamoth is a valley in the country of moab to the top of
and israel sent messengers to sehon king of the amorrhites
saying
i beseech thee that i may have leave to pass through thy land we
will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards we will not drink
waters of the wells we will go the kings highway till we be past thy
borders
and he would not grant that israel should pass by his borders
but rather gathering an army went forth to meet them in the desert and
came to jasa and fought against them
and he was slain by them with the edge of the sword and they
possessed his land from the arnon unto the jeboc and to the confines of
the children of ammon for the borders of the ammonites were kept with
a strong garrison
so israel took all his cities and dwelt in the cities of the
hesebon was the city of sehon the king of the amorrhites who
fought against the king of moab and took all the land that had been of
his dominion as far as the arnon
therefore it is said in the proverb come into hesebon let the
city of sehon be built and set up
a fire is gone out of hesebon a flame from the city of sehon
and hath consumed ar of the moabites and the inhabitants of the high
places of the arnon
woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chamos he hath
given his sons to flight and his daughters into captivity to sehon the
king of the amorrhites
their yoke is perished from hesebon unto dibon they came weary
to nophe and unto medaba
so israel dwelt in the land of the amorrhite
and moses sent some to take a view of jazer and they took the
villages of it and conquered the inhabitants
and they turned themselves and went up by the way of basan and
and the lord said to moses fear him not for i have delivered
him and all his people and his country into thy hand and thou shalt do
to him as thou didst to sehon the king of the amorrhites the inhabitant
of hesebon
so they slew him also with his sons and all his people not
letting any one escape and they possessed his land
way balaam is rebuked by an angel
and they went forward and encamped in the plains of moab over
against where jericho is situate beyond the jordan
and balac the son of sephor seeing all that israel had done to
the amorrhite
and that the moabites were in great fear of him and were not able
to sustain his assault
he said to the elders of madian so will this people destroy all
that dwell in our borders as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the
very roots now he was at that time king in moab
he sent therefore messengers to balaam the son of beor a
soothsayer who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of ammon
to call him and to say behold a people is come out of egypt that hath
covered the face of the earth sitting over against me
come therefore and curse this people because it is mightier than
know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed and he whom thou shalt
curse is cursed
and the ancients of moab and the elders of madian went with the
price of divination in their hands and where they were come to balaam
and had told him all the words of balac
he answered tarry here this night and i will answer whatsoever
the lord shall say to me and while they stayed with balaam god came
and said to him
what mean these men that are with thee
he answered balac the son of sephor king of the moabites hath
sent to me
saying behold a people that is come out of egypt hath covered
the face of the land come and curse them if by any means i may fight
with them and drive them away
and god said to balaam thou shalt not go with them nor shalt
thou curse the people because it is blessed
and he rose in the morning and said to the princes go into your
country because the lord hath forbid me to come with you
the princes returning said to balac balaam would not come with
us
then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before
who when they were come to balaam said thus saith balac the
son of sephor delay not to come to me
for i am ready to honour thee and will give thee whatsoever thou
wilt come and curse this people
balaam answered if balac would give me his house full of silver
and gold i cannot alter the word of the lord my god to speak either
more or less
i pray you to stay here this night also that i may know what the
already that it was not gods will he should go came from the
inclination he had to gratify balac for the sake of worldly gain and
this perverse disposition god punished by permitting him to go though
not to curse the people as he would willingly have done and suffering
him to fall still deeper and deeper into sin till he came at last to
give that abominable counsel against the people of god which ended in
his own destruction so sad a thing it is to indulge a passion for
money
god therefore came to balaam in the night and said to him if
these men be come to call thee arise and go with them yet so that
thou do what i shall command thee
balaam arose in the morning and saddling his ass went with them
and god was angry and an angel of the lord stood in the way
against balaam who sat on the ass and had two servants with him
the ass seeing the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword
turned herself out of the way and went into the field and when balaam
beat her and had a mind to bring her again to the way
the angel stood in a narrow place between two walls wherewith
the vineyards were enclosed
and the ass seeing him thrust herself close to the wall and
bruised the foot of the rider but he beat her again
and nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place where
there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left
stood to meet him
and when the ass saw the angel standing she fell under the feet
of the rider who being angry beat her sides more vehemently with a
staff
and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said what have
these speeches to rebuke by the mouth of a brute beast the brutal
fury and folly of balaam
balaam answered because thou hast deserved it and hast served
me ill i would i had a sword that i might kill thee
the ass said am not i thy beast on which thou hast been always
accustomed to ride until this present day tell me if i ever did the
like thing to thee but he said never
forthwith the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the
angel standing in the way with a drawn sword and he worshipped him
falling flat on the ground
and the angel said to him why beatest thou thy ass these three
times i am come to withstand thee because thy way is perverse and
contrary to me
sake of gain to curse the people of whom i am the guardian
and unless the ass had turned out of the way giving place to me
who stood against thee i had slain thee and she should have lived
balaam said i have sinned not knowing that thou didst stand
against me and now if it displease thee that i go i will return
the angel said go with these men and see thou speak no other
thing than what i shall command thee he went therefore with the
princes
and when balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of
the moabites that is situate in the uttermost borders of arnon
and he said to balaam i sent messengers to call thee why didst
thou not come immediately to me was it because i am not able to reward
thy coming
he answered him lo here i am shall i have power to speak any
other thing but that which god shall put in my mouth
so they went on together and came into a city that was in the
uttermost borders of his kingdom
and when balac had killed oxen and sheep he sent presents to
and when morning was come he brought him to the high places of
prophesy good things of them
and balaam said to balac build me here seven altars and prepare
as many calves and the same number of rams
and when he had done according to the word of balaam they laid
together a calf and a ram upon every altar
and balaam said to balac stand a while by thy burnt offering
until i go to see if perhaps the lord will meet me and whatsoever he
shall command i will speak to thee
and when he was gone with speed god met him and balaam speaking
to him said i have erected seven altars and have laid on everyone a
calf and a ram
and the lord put the word in his mouth and said return to balac
and thus shalt thou speak
returning he found balac standing by his burnt offering with all
the princes of the moabites
and taking up his parable he said balac king of the moabites
hath brought me from aram from the mountains of the east come said
he and curse jacob make haste and detest israel
how shall i curse him whom god hath not cursed by what means
should i detest him whom the lord detesteth not
i shall see him from the tops of the rocks and shall consider him
from the hills this people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned
among the nations
who can count the dust of jacob and know the number of the stock
of israel let my soul die the death of the just and my last end be
like to them
and balac said to balaam what is this that thou dost i sent for
thee to curse my enemies and thou contrariwise blessest them
he answered him can i speak any thing else but what the lord
commandeth
balac therefore said come with me to another place from whence
thou mayest see part of israel and canst not see them all curse them
from thence
and when he had brought him to a high place upon the top of
mount phasga balaam built seven altars and laying on every one a calf
and a ram
he said to balac stand here by thy burnt offering while i go to
meet him
and when the lord had met him and had put the word in his mouth
he said return to balac and thus shalt thou say to him
returning he found him standing by his burnt sacrifice and the
princes of the moabites with him and balac said to him what hath the
but he taking up his parable said stand o balac and give ear
hear thou son of sephor
god is not a man that he should lie nor is the son of man that
he should be changed hath he said then and will he not do hath he
spoken and will he not fulfil
i was brought to bless the blessing i am not able to hinder
there is no idol in jacob neither is there an image god to be
seen in israel the lord his god is with him and the sound of the
victory of the king in him
god hath brought him out of egypt whose strength is like to the
rhinoceros
there is no soothsaying in jacob nor divination in israel in
their times it shall be told to jacob and to israel what god hath
wrought
behold the people shall rise up as a lioness and shall lift
itself up as a lion it shall not lie down till it devour the prey and
drink the blood of the slain
and balac said to balaam neither curse nor bless him
and he said did i not tell thee that whatsoever god should
command me that i would do
and balac said to him come and i will bring thee to another
place if peradventure it please god that thou mayest curse them from
thence
and when he had brought him upon the top of mount phogor which
looketh towards the wilderness
balaam said to him build me here seven altars and prepare as
many calves and the same number of rams
balac did as balaam had said and he laid on every altar a calf
and a ram
and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord that he should bless
setting his face towards the desert
and lifting up his eyes he saw israel abiding in their tents by
their tribes and the spirit of god rushing upon him
he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said
the bearer of the words of god hath said he that hath beheld the
vision of the almighty he that falleth and so his eyes are opened
how beautiful are thy tabernacles o jacob and thy tents o
as woody valleys as watered gardens near the rivers as
tabernacles which the lord hath pitched as cedars by the waterside
water shall flow out of his bucket and his seed shall be in many
waters for agag his king shall be removed and his kingdom shall be
taken away
god hath brought him out of egypt whose strength is like to the
rhinoceros they shall devour the nations that are his enemies and
break their bones and pierce them with arrows
lying down he hath slept as a lion and as a lioness whom none
shall dare to rouse he that blesseth thee shall also himself be
blessed he that curseth thee shall be reckoned accursed
and balac being angry against balaam clapped his hands together
and said i called thee to curse my enemies and thou on the contrary
hast blessed them three times
return to thy place i had determined indeed greatly to honour
thee but the lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee
balaam made answer to balac did i not say to thy messengers
whom thou sentest to me
if balac would give me his house full of silver and gold i
cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to utter any thing of my
own head either good or evil but whatsoever the lord shall say that i
will speak
but yet going to my people i will give thee counsel what this
people shall do to thy people in the latter days
therefore taking up his parable again he said balaam the son of
the hearer of the words of god hath said who knoweth the
doctrine of the highest and seeth the visions of the almighty who
falling hath his eyes opened
i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not near a
and shall strike the chiefs of moab and shall waste all the children of
and he shall possess idumea the inheritance of seir shall come
to their enemies but israel shall do manfully
out of jacob shall he come that shall rule and shall destroy the
remains of the city
and when he saw amalec he took up his parable and said amalec
the beginning of nations whose latter ends shall be destroyed
he saw also the cinite and took up his parable and said thy
habitation indeed is strong but though thou build thy nest in a rock
and thou be chosen of the stock of cin how long shalt thou be
able to continue for assur shall take thee captive
and taking up his parable again he said alas who shall live
when god shall do these things
they shall come in galleys from italy they shall overcome the
also shall perish
and balaam rose and returned to his place balac also returned
the way that he came
thousand are slain the zeal of phinees
and israel at that time abode in settim and the people committed
fornication with the daughters of moab
who called them to their sacrifices and they ate of them and
adored their gods
and israel was initiated to beelphegor upon which the lord being
angry
were to him
said to moses take all the princes of the people and hang them
up on gibbets against the sun that my fury may be turned away from
and moses said to the judges of israel let every man kill his
neighbours that have been initiated to beelphegor
and behold one of the children of israel went in before his
brethren to a harlot of madian in the sight of moses and of all the
children of israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle
and when phinees the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest
saw it he rose up from the midst of the multitude and taking a dagger
went in after the israelite into the brothel house and thrust
both of them through together to wit the man and the woman in the
genital parts and the scourge ceased from the children of israel
and there were slain four and twenty thousand men
and the lord said to moses
phinees the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath
turned away my wrath from the children of israel because he was moved
with my zeal against them that i myself might not destroy the children
of israel in my zeal
therefore say to him behold i give him the peace of my covenant
and the covenant of the priesthood for ever shall be both to him
and his seed because he hath been zealous for his god and hath made
atonement for the wickedness of the children of israel
and the name of the israelite that was slain with the woman of
and the madianite woman that was slain with him was called
and the lord spoke to moses saying
let the madianites find you their enemies and slay you them
because they also have acted like enemies against you and have
guilefully deceived you by the idol phogor and cozbi their sister a
daughter of a prince of madian who was slain in the day of the plague
for the sacrilege of phogor
after the blood of the guilty was shed the lord said to moses and
to eleazar the son of aaron the priest
number the whole sum of the children of israel from twenty years
old and upward by their houses and kindreds all that are able to go

this is the number of the children of israel that were enrolled

son of nun
then came the daughters of salphaad the son of hepher the son of
and they stood before moses and eleazar the priest and all the
princes of the people at the door of the tabernacle of the covenant and
said
our father died in the desert and was not in the sedition that
was raised against the lord under core but he died in his own sin and
he had no male children why is his name taken away out of his family
because he had no son give us a possession among the kinsmen of our
father
and moses referred their cause to the judgment of the lord
and the lord said to him
the daughters of salphaad demand a just thing give them a
possession among their fathers kindred and let them succeed him in his
inheritance
and to the children of israel thou shalt speak these things
when a man dieth without a son his inheritance shall pass to his
daughter
if he have no daughter his brethren shall succeed him
and if he have no brethren you shall give the inheritance to his
fathers brethren
but if he have no uncles by the father the inheritance shall be
given to them that are the next akin and this shall be to the children
of israel sacred by a perpetual law as the lord hath commanded moses
the lord also said to moses go up into this mountain abarim and
view from thence the land which i will give to the children of israel
and when thou shalt have seen it thou also shalt go to thy
people as thy brother aaron is gone
because you offended me in the desert of sin in the contradiction
of the multitude neither would you sanctify me before them at the
waters these are the waters of contradiction in cades of the desert of
and moses answered him
may the lord the god of the spirits of all flesh provide a man
that may be over this multitude
and may go out and in before them and may lead them out or
bring them in lest the people of the lord be as sheep without a
shepherd
and the lord said to him take josue the son of nun a man in
whom is the spirit and put thy hand upon him
and he shall stand before eleazar the priest and all the
multitude

thy glory that all the congregation of the children of israel may hear
him

of the multitude shall go out and go in at his word

and moses told the children of israel all that the lord had
commanded him
and he said to the princes of the tribes of the children of
if any man make a vow to the lord or bind himself by an oath he
shall not make his word void but shall fulfil all that he promised
if a woman vow any thing and bind herself by an oath being in
her fathers house and but yet a girl in age if her father knew the
vow that she hath promised and the oath wherewith she hath bound her
soul and held his peace she shall be bound by the vow
whatsoever she promised and swore she shall fulfil in deed
but if her father immediately as soon as he heard it gainsaid
it both her vows and her oaths shall be void neither shall she be
bound to what she promised because her father hath gainsaid it
if she have a husband and shall vow any thing and the word once
going out of her mouth shall bind her soul by an oath
the day that her husband shall hear it and not gainsay it she
shall be bound to the vow and shall give whatsoever she promised
but if as soon as he heareth he gainsay it and make her promises
and the words wherewith she had bound her soul of no effect the lord
will forgive her
the widow and she that is divorced shall fulfil whatsoever they
vow
if the wife in the house of her husband hath bound herself by
vow and by oath
if her husband hear and hold his peace and doth not disallow
the promise she shall accomplish whatsoever she had promised
but if forthwith he gainsay it she shall not be bound by the
promise because her husband gainsaid it and the lord will be merciful
to her
if she vow and bind herself by oath to afflict her soul by
fasting or abstinence from other things it shall depend on the will of
her husband whether she shall do it or not do it
but if the husband hearing it hold his peace and defer the
declaring his mind till another day whatsoever she had vowed and
promised she shall fulfil because immediately as he heard it he held
his peace
but if he gainsay it after that he knew it he shall bear her
iniquity
these are the laws which the lord appointed to moses between the
husband and the wife between the father and the daughter that is as yet
but a girl in age or that abideth in her fathers house
and the lord spoke to moses saying
revenge first the children of israel on the madianites and so
thou shalt be gathered to thy people
and moses forthwith said arm of you men to fight who may take
the revenge of the lord on the madianites
let a thousand men be chosen out of every tribe of israel to be
sent to the war
and they gave a thousand of every tribe that is to say twelve
thousand men well appointed for battle
and moses sent them with phinees the son of eleazar the priest
and he delivered to him the holy vessels and the trumpets to sound
and when they had fought against the madianites and had overcome
them they slew all the men
and their kings evi and recem and sur and hur and rebe five
princes of the nation balaam also the son of beor they killed with the
sword
and they took their women and their children captives and all
their cattle and all their goods and all their possessions they
plundered
and all their cities and their villages and castles they
burned
and they carried away the booty and all that they had taken both
of men and of beasts
and they brought them to moses and eleazar the priest and to
all the multitude of the children of israel but the rest of the things
for use they carried to the camp on the plains of moab beside the
and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the
synagogue went forth to meet them without the camp
and moses being angry with the chief officers of the army the
tribunes and the centurions that were come from the battle
said why have you saved the women
are not these they that deceived the children of israel by the
counsel of balaam and made you transgress against the lord by the sin
of phogor for which also the people was punished
therefore kill all that are of the male sex even of the
children and put to death the women that have carnally known men
killed in war deut but the great lord of life and death was
pleased to order it otherwise in the present case in detestation of the
wickedness of this people who by the counsel of balaam had sent their
women among the israelites on purpose to draw them from god
but the girls and all the women that are virgins save for
yourselves
and stay without the camp seven days he that hath killed a man
or touched one that is killed shall be purified the third day and the
seventh day
and of all the spoil every garment or vessel or any thing made
for use of the skins or hair of goats or of wood shall be purified
eleazar also the priest spoke to the men of the army that had
fought in this manner this is the ordinance of the law which the lord
hath commanded moses
gold and silver and brass and iron and lead and tin
and all that may pass through the fire shall be purified by
fire but whatsoever cannot abide the fire shall be sanctified with the
water of expiation
and you shall wash your garments the seventh day and being
purified you shall afterwards enter into the camp
and the lord said to moses
take the sum of the things that were taken both of man and beast
thou and eleazar the priest and the princes of the multitude
and thou shalt divide the spoil equally between them that fought
and went out to the war and between the rest of the multitude
and thou shalt separate a portion to the lord from them that
fought and were in the battle one soul of five hundred as well of
persons as of oxen and asses and sheep
and thou shalt give it to eleazar the priest because they are
the firstfruits of the lord
out of the moiety also of the children of israel thou shalt take
the fiftieth head of persons and of oxen and asses and sheep and of
all beasts and thou shalt give them to the levites that watch in the
charge of the tabernacle of the lord
and moses and eleazar did as the lord had commanded
and the spoil which the army had taken was six hundred seventy
five thousand sheep
seventytwo thousand oxen
sixtyone thousand asses
and thirtytwo thousand persons of the female sex that had not
known men
and one half was given to them that had been in the battle to
wit three hundred thirtyseven thousand five hundred sheep
out of which for the portion of the lord were reckoned six
hundred seventy five sheep
and out of the thirtysix thousand oxen seventytwo oxen
out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses sixtyone asses
out of the sixteen thousand persons there fell to the portion of
the lord thirtytwo souls
and moses delivered the number of the firstfruits of the lord to
out of the half of the children of israel which he had separated
for them that had been in the battle
but out of the half that fell to the rest of the multitude that
is to say out of the three hundred thirtyseven thousand five hundred
sheep
and out of the thirtysix thousand oxen
and out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses
and out of the sixteen thousand persons
moses took the fiftieth head and gave it to the levites that
watched in the tabernacle of the lord as the lord had commanded
and when the commanders of the army and the tribunes and
centurions were come to moses they said
we thy servants have reckoned up the number of the fighting men
whom we had under our hand and not so much as one was wanting
therefore we offer as gifts to the lord what gold every one of us
could find in the booty in garters and tablets rings and bracelets
and chains that thou mayst pray to the lord for us
and moses and eleazar the priest received all the gold in divers
kinds
in weight sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty sicles from
the tribunes and from the centurions
for that which every one had taken in the booty was his own
and that which was received they brought into the tabernacle of
the testimony for a memorial of the children of israel before the lord
their inheritance on the east side of jordan upon conditions approved
of by moses
and the sons of ruben and gad had many flocks of cattle and their
substance in beasts was infinite and when they saw the lands of jazer
and galaad fit for feeding cattle
they came to moses and eleazar the priest and the princes of the
multitude and said
ataroth and dibon and jazer and nemra hesebon and eleale and
the land which the lord hath conquered in the sight of the
children of israel is a very fertile soil for the feeding of beasts
and we thy servants have very much cattle
and we pray thee if we have found favour in thy sight that thou
give it to us thy servants in possession and make us not pass over the
and moses answered them what shall your brethren go to fight
and will you sit here
why do ye overturn the minds of the children of israel that they
may not dare to pass into the place which the lord hath given them
was it not thus your fathers did when i sent from cadesbarne to
view the land
and when they were come as far as the valley of the cluster
having viewed all the country they overturned the hearts of the
children of israel that they should not enter into the coasts which
the lord gave them
and he swore in his anger saying
if these men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old
and upward shall see the land which i promised with an oath to
except caleb the son of jephone the cenezite and josue the son
of nun these have fulfilled my will
and the lord being angry against israel led them about through
the desert forty years until the whole generation that had done evil
in his sight was consumed
and behold said he you are risen up instead of your fathers
the increase and offspring of sinful men to augment the fury of the
for if you will not follow him he will leave the people in the
wilderness and you shall be the cause of the destruction of all
but they coming near said we will make sheepfolds and stalls
for our cattle and strong cities for our children
and we ourselves will go armed and ready for battle before the
children of israel until we bring them in unto their places our
little ones and all we have shall be in walled cities for fear of the
ambushes of the inhabitants
we will not return into our houses until the children of israel
possess their inheritance
neither will we seek any thing beyond the jordan because we have
already our possession on the east side thereof
and moses said to them if you do what you promise go on well
appointed for war before the lord
and let every fighting man pass over the jordan until the lord
overthrow his enemies
and all the land be brought under him then shall you be
blameless before the lord and before israel and you shall obtain the
countries that you desire before the lord
but if you do not what you say no man can doubt but you sin
against god and know ye that your sin shall overtake you
build therefore cities for your children and folds and stalls
for your sheep and beasts and accomplish what you have promised
and the children of gad and ruben said to moses we are thy
servants we will do what my lord commandeth
we will leave our children and our wives and sheep and cattle
in the cities of galaad
and we thy servants all well appointed will march on to the war
as thou my lord speakest
moses therefore commanded eleazar the priest and josue the son
of nun and the princes of the families of all the tribes of israel and
said to them
if the children of gad and the children of ruben pass with you
over the jordan all armed for war before the lord and the land be made
subject to you give them galaad in possession
but if they will not pass armed with you into the land of
and the children of gad and the children of ruben answered as
the lord hath spoken to his servants so will we do
we will go armed before the lord into the land of chanaan and we
confess that we have already received our possession beyond the jordan
moses therefore gave to the children of gad and of ruben and to
the half tribe of manasses the son of joseph the kingdom of sehon king
of the amorrhites and the kingdom of og king of basan and their land
and the cities thereof round about
and the sons of gad built dibon and ataroth and aroer
and etroth and sophan and jazer and jegbaa
and bethnemra and betharan fenced cities and folds for their
cattle
but the children of ruben built hesebon and eleale and
and nabo and baalmeon their names being changed and sabama
giving names to the cities which they had built
moreover the children of machir the son of manasses went into
thereof
and moses gave the land of galaad to machir the son of manasses
and he dwelt in it
and jair the son of manasses went and took the villages thereof
and he called them havoth jair that is to say the villages of jair
nobe also went and took canath with the villages thereof and he
called it by his own name nobe
promise
these are the mansions of the children of israel who went out of
from egypt to the land of promise were figures according to the
fathers of the steps and degrees by which christians leaving sin are to
advance from virtue to virtue till they come to the heavenly mansions
after this life to see and enjoy god
which moses wrote down according to the places of their encamping
which they changed by the commandment of the lord
now the children of israel departed from ramesses the first month
on the fifteenth day of the first month the day after the phase with a
mighty hand in the sight of all the egyptians
who were burying their firstborn whom the lord had slain upon
their gods also he had executed vengeance
and they camped in soccoth
and from soccoth they came into etham which is in the uttermost
borders of the wilderness
departing from thence they came over against phihahiroth which
looketh towards beelsephon and they camped before magdalum
and departing from phihahiroth they passed through the midst of
the sea into the wilderness and having marched three days through the
desert of etham they camped in mara
and departing from mara they came into elim where there were
twelve fountains of waters and seventy palm trees and there they
camped
but departing from thence also they pitched their tents by the
they camped in the desert of sin
and they removed from thence and came to daphca
and departing from daphca they camped in alus
and departing from alus they pitched their tents in raphidim
where the people wanted water to drink
and departing from raphidim they camped in the desert of sinai
but departing also from the desert of sinai they came to the
graves of lust
and departing from the graves of lust they camped in haseroth
and from haseroth they came to rethma
and departing from rethma they camped in remmomphares
and they departed from thence and came to lebna
removing from lebna they camped in ressa
and departing from ressa they came to ceelatha
and they removed from thence and camped in the mountain sepher
departing from the mountain sepher they came to arada
from thence they went and camped in maceloth
and departing from maceloth they came to thahath
removing from thahath they camped in thare
and they departed from thence and pitched their tents in methca
and removing from methca they camped in hesmona
and departing from hesmona they came to moseroth
and removing from moseroth they camped in benejaacan
and departing from benejaacan they came to mount gadgad
from thence they went and camped in jetebatha
and from jetebatha they came to hebrona
and departing from hebrona they camped in asiongaber
they removed from thence and came into the desert of sin which
is cades
and departing from cades they camped in mount hor in the
uttermost borders of the land of edom
and aaron the priest went up into mount hor at the commandment of
the lord and there he died in the fortieth year of the coming forth of
the children of israel out of egypt the fifth month the first day of
the month
when he was a hundred and twentythree years old
and king arad the chanaanite who dwelt towards the south heard
that the children of israel were come to the land of chanaan
and they departed from mount hor and camped in salmona
from whence they removed and came to phunon
and departing from phunon they camped in oboth
and from oboth they came to ijeabarim which is in the borders of
the moabites
and departing from ijeabarim they pitched their tents in
from thence they went and camped in helmondeblathaim
and departing from helmondeblathaim they came to the mountains
of abarim over against nabo
and departing from the mountains of abarim they passed to the
plains of moab by the jordan over against jericho
and there they camped from bethsimoth even to ablesatim in the
plains of the moabites
where the lord said to moses
command the children of israel and say to them when you shall
have passed over the jordan entering into the land of chanaan
destroy all the inhabitants of that land beat down their
pillars and break in pieces their statues and waste all their high
places
cleansing the land and dwelling in it for i have given it you
for a possession
and you shall divide it among you by lot to the more you shall
give a larger part and to the fewer a lesser to every one as the lot
shall fall so shall the inheritance be given the possession shall be
divided by the tribes and the families
but if you will not kill the inhabitants of the land they that
remain shall be unto you as nails in your eyes and spears in your
sides and they shall be your adversaries in the land of your
habitation
and whatsoever i had thought to do to them i will do to you
of it
and the lord spoke to moses saying
command the children of israel and thou shalt say to them when
you are entered into the land of chanaan and it shall be fallen into
your possession by lot it shall be bounded by these limits
the south side shall begin from the wilderness of sin which is by
which limits shall go round on the south side by the ascent of the
scorpions
and the limits shall fetch a compass from asemona to the torrent
of egypt and shall end in the shore of the great sea
and the west side shall begin from the great sea and the same
shall be the end thereof
but toward the north side the borders shall begin from the great
sea reaching to the most high mountain
from which they shall come to emath as far as the borders of
and the limits shall go as far as zephrona and the village of
from thence they shall mark out the grounds towards the east side
from the village of enan unto sephama
and from sephama the bounds shall go down to rebla over against
the fountain of daphnis from thence they shall come eastward to the sea
of cenereth
miracles of our lord
and shall reach as far as the jordan and at the last shall be
closed in by the most salt sea this shall be your land with its borders
round about
and moses commanded the children of israel saying this shall be
the land which you shall possess by lot and which the lord hath
commanded to be given to the nine tribes and to the half tribe
for the tribe of the children of ruben by their families and the
tribe of the children of gad according to the number of their kindreds
and half of the tribe of manasses
that is two tribes and a half have received their portion
beyond the jordan over against jericho at the east side
and the lord said to moses
these are the names of the men that shall divide the land unto
you eleazar the priest and josue the son of nun
and one prince of every tribe
whose names are these of the tribe of juda caleb the son of
of the tribe of simeon samuel the son of ammiud
of the tribe of benjamin elidad the son of chaselon
of the tribe of the children of dan bocci the son of jogli
of the children of joseph of the tribe of manasses hanniel the
son of ephod
of the tribe of ephraim camuel the son of sephtan
of the tribe of zabulon elisaphan the son of pharnach
of the tribe of issachar phaltiel the prince the son of ozan
of the tribe of aser ahiud the son of salomi
of the tribe of nephtali phedael the son of ammiud
these are they whom the lord hath commanded to divide the land of
of refuge
and the lord spoke these things also to moses in the plains of
command the children of israel that they give to the levites out
of their possessions
cities to dwell in and their suburbs round about that they may
abide in the towns and the suburbs may be for them cattle and beasts
which suburbs shall reach from the walls of the cities outward a
thousand paces on every side
toward the east shall be two thousand cubits and toward the south
in like manner shall be two thousand cubits toward the sea also which
looketh to the west shall be the same extent and the north side shall
be bounded with the like limits and the cities shall be in the midst
and the suburbs without
and among the cities which you shall give to the levites six
shall be separated for refuge to fugitives that he who hath shed blood
may flee to them and besides these there shall be other fortytwo
cities
that is in all fortyeight with their suburbs
and of these cities which shall be given out of the possessions of
the children of israel from them that have more more shall be taken
and from them that have less fewer each shall give towns to the
the lord said to moses
speak to the children of israel and thou shalt say to them when
you shall have passed over the jordan into the land of chanaan
determine what cities shall be for the refuge of fugitives who
have shed blood against their will
and when the fugitive shall be in them the kinsman of him that
is slain may not have power to kill him until he stand before the
multitude and his cause be judged
and of those cities that are separated for the refuge of
fugitives
three shall be beyond the jordan and three in the land of
as well for the children of israel as for strangers and
sojourners that he may flee to them who hath shed blood against his
will
if any man strike with iron and he die that was struck he shall
be guilty of murder and he himself shall die
if he throw a stone and he that is struck die he shall be
punished in the same manner
if he that is struck with wood die he shall be revenged by the
blood of him that struck him
the kinsman of him that was slain shall kill the murderer as
soon as he apprehendeth him he shall kill him
if through hatred any one push a man or fling any thing at him
with ill design
or being his enemy strike him with his hand and he die the
striker shall be guilty of murder the kinsman of him that was slain as
soon as he findeth him shall kill him
but if by chance medley and without hatred
and enmity he do any of these things
and this be proved in the hearing of the people and the cause be
debated between him that struck and the next of kin
the innocent shall be delivered from the hand of the revenger
and shall be brought back by sentence into the city to which he had
fled and he shall abide there until the death of the high priest that
is anointed with the holy oil
was to be effected by the death of christ the high priest and the
anointed of god
if the murderer be found without the limits of the cities that
are appointed for the banished
and be struck by him that is the avenger of blood he shall not
be guilty that killed him
for the fugitive ought to have stayed in the city until the death
of the high priest and after he is dead then shall the manslayer
return to his own country
these things shall be perpetual and for an ordinance in all your
dwellings
the murderer shall be punished by witnesses none shall be
condemned upon the evidence of one man
you shall not take money of him that is guilty of blood but he
shall die forthwith
the banished and fugitives before the death of the high priest
may by no means return into their own cities
defile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the
blood of the innocent neither can it otherwise be expiated but by his
blood that hath shed the blood of another
and thus shall your possession be cleansed myself abiding with
you for i am the lord that dwell among the children of israel
all are to marry within their own tribes
and the princes of the families of galaad the son of machir the
son of manasses of the stock of the children of joseph came and spoke
to moses before the princes of israel and said
the lord hath commanded thee my lord that thou shouldst divide
the land by lot to the children of israel and that thou shouldst give
to the daughters of salphaad our brother the possession due to their
father
now if men of another tribe take them to wives their possession
will follow them and being transferred to another tribe will be a
diminishing of our inheritance
and so it shall come to pass that when the jubilee the is the
fiftieth year of remission is come the distribution made by the lots
shall be confounded and the possession of the one shall pass to the
others
moses answered the children of israel and said by the command of
the lord the tribe of the children of joseph hath spoken rightly
and this is the law promulgated by the lord touching the daughters
of salphaad let them marry to whom they will only so that it be to men
of their own tribe
lest the possession of the children of israel be mingled from
tribe to tribe for all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and
kindred
and all women shall take husbands of the same tribe that the
inheritance may remain in the families
and that the tribes be not mingled one with another but remain so
as they were separated by the lord and the daughters of salphaad
did as was commanded
and maala and thersa and hegla and melcha and noa were
married to the sons of their uncle by their father
of the family of manasses who was the son of joseph and the
possession that had been allotted to them remained in the tribe and
family of their father
these are the commandments and judgment which the lord commanded
by the hand of moses to the children of israel in the plains of moab
upon the jordan over against jericho
it repeats and inculcates the ordinances formerly given on mount sinai
with other precepts not expressed before the hebrews from the first
words in the book call it elle haddebarim
