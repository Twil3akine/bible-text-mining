requesting their brethren there to offer sacrifice and to pray for the
king and for them acknowledging their manifold sins
and these are the words of the book which baruch the son of
son helcias wrote in babylonia
in the fifth year in the seventh day of the month at the time
that the chaldeans took jerusalem and burnt it with fire
and baruch read the words of this book in the hearing of jechonias
the son of joakim king of juda and in the hearing of all the people
that came to hear the book
and in the hearing of the nobles the sons of the kings and in the
hearing of the ancients and in the hearing of the people from the
least even to the greatest of them that dwelt in babylonia by the river
and when they heard it they wept and fasted and prayed before the
and they made a collection of money according to every mans power
and they sent it to jerusalem to joakim the priest the son of
that were found with him in jerusalem
at the time when he received the vessels of the temple of the lord
which had been taken away out of the temple to return them into the
land of juda the tenth day of the month sivan the silver vessels which
after that nabuchodonosor the king of babylon had carried away
the land from jerusalem and brought them bound to babylon
and they said behold we have sent you money buy with it
holocausts and frankincense and make meat offerings and offerings for
sin at the altar of the lord our god
and pray ye for the life of nabuchodonosor the king of babylon
and for the life of balthasar his son that their days may be upon earth
as the days of heaven
and that the lord may give us strength and enlighten our eyes
that we may live under the shadow of nabuchodonosor the king of babylon
and under the shadow of balthasar his son and may serve them many days
and may find favour in their sight
and pray ye for us to the lord our god for we have sinned against
the lord our god and his wrath is not turned away from us even to this
day
and read ye this book which we have sent to you to be read in the
temple of the lord on feasts and proper days
and you shall say to the lord our god belongeth justice but to
us confusion of our face as it is come to pass at this day to all juda
and to the inhabitants of jerusalem
to our kings and to our princes and to our priests and to our
prophets and to our fathers
we have sinned before the lord our god and have not believed him
nor put our trust in him
and we were not obedient to him and we have not hearkened to the
voice of the lord our god to walk in his commandments which he hath
given us
from the day that he brought our fathers out of the land of egypt
even to this day we were disobedient to the lord our god and going
astray we turned away from hearing his voice
and many evils have cleaved to us and the curses which the lord
foretold by moses his servant who brought our fathers out of the land
of egypt to give us a land flowing with milk and honey as at this day
and we have not hearkened to the voice of the lord our god
according to all the words of the prophets whom he sent to us
and we have gone away every man after the inclinations of his own
wicked heart to serve strange gods and to do evil in the sight of the
wherefore the lord our god hath made good his word that he spoke
to us and to our judges that have judged israel and to our kings and
to our princes and to all israel and juda
that the lord would bring upon us great evils such as never
happened under heaven as they have come to pass in jerusalem according
to the things that are written in the law of moses
that a man should eat the flesh of his own son and the flesh of
his own daughter
and he hath delivered them up to be under the hand of all the kings
that are round about us to be a reproach and desolation among all the
people among whom the lord hath scattered us
and we are brought under and are not uppermost because we have
sinned against the lord our god by not obeying his voice
to the lord our god belongeth justice but to us and to our
fathers confusion of face as at this day
for the lord hath pronounced against us all these evils that are
come upon us
and we have not entreated the face of the lord our god that we
might return every one of us from our most wicked ways
and the lord hath watched over us for evil and hath brought it
upon us for the lord is just in all his works which he hath commanded
us
and we have not hearkened to his voice to walk in the commandments
of the lord which he hath set before us
and now o lord god of israel who hast brought thy people out of
the land of egypt with a strong hand and with signs and with wonders
and with thy great power and with a mighty arm and hast made thee a
name as at this day
we have sinned we have done wickedly we have acted unjustly o
let thy wrath be turned away from us for we are left a few among
the nations where thou hast scattered us
hear o lord our prayers and our petitions and deliver us for
thy own sake and grant that we may find favour in the sight of them
that have led us away
that all the earth may know that thou art the lord our god and
that thy name is called upon israel and upon his posterity
look down upon us o lord from thy holy house and incline thy
ear and hear us
open thy eyes and behold for the dead that are in hell whose
spirit is taken away from their bowels shall not give glory and justice
to the lord
that is they shall not acknowledge and glorify his justice as penitent
sinners do upon earth
but the soul that is sorrowful for the greatness of evil she hath
done and goeth bowed down and feeble and the eyes that fail and the
hungry soul giveth glory and justice to thee the lord
for it is not for the justices of our fathers that we pour out our
prayers and beg mercy in thy sight o lord our god
but because thou hast sent out thy wrath and thy indignation upon
us as thou hast spoken by the hand of thy servants the prophets
saying
thus saith the lord bow down your shoulder and your neck and
serve the king of babylon and you shall remain in the land which i have
given to your fathers
but if you will not hearken to the voice of the lord your god to
serve the king of babylon i will cause you to depart out of the cities
of juda and from without jerusalem
and i will take away from you the voice of mirth and the voice of
joy and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride and
all the land shall be without any footstep of inhabitants
and they hearkened not to thy voice to serve the king of babylon
and thou hast made good thy words which thou spokest by the hands of
thy servants the prophets that the bones of our kings and the bones of
our fathers should be removed out of their place
and behold they are cast out to the heat of the sun and to the
frost of the night and they have died in grievous pains by famine and
by the sword and in banishment
and thou hast made the temple in which thy name was called upon
as it is at this day for the iniquity of the house of israel and the
house of juda
and thou hast dealt with us o lord our god according to all thy
goodness and according to all that great mercy of thine
as thou spokest by the hand of thy servant moses in the day when
thou didst command him to write thy law before the children of israel
saying if you will not hear my voice this great multitude shall
be turned into a very small number among the nations where i will
scatter them
for i know that the people will not hear me for they are a people
of a stiff neck but they shall turn to their heart in the land of their
captivity
and they shall know that i am the lord their god and i will give
them a heart and they shall understand and ears and they shall hear
and they shall praise me in the land of their captivity and shall
be mindful of my name
and they shall turn away themselves from their stiff neck and
from their wicked deeds for they shall remember the way of their
fathers that sinned against me
and i will bring them back again into the land which i promised
with an oath to their fathers abraham isaac and jacob and they shall
be masters thereof and i will multiply them and they shall not be
diminished
and i will make with them another covenant that shall be
everlasting to be their god and they shall be my people and i will no
more remove my people the children of israel out of the land that i
have given them
forsaking true wisdom a prophecy of christ
and now o lord almighty the god of israel the soul in anguish
and the troubled spirit crieth to thee
hear o lord and have mercy for thou art a merciful god and have
pity on us for we have sinned before thee
for thou remainest for ever and shall we perish everlastingly
o lord almighty the god of israel hear now the prayer of the dead
of israel and of their children that have sinned before thee and have
not hearkened to the voice of the lord their god wherefore evils have
cleaved fast to us
remember not the iniquities of our fathers but think upon thy
hand and upon thy name at this time
for thou art the lord our god and we will praise thee o lord
because for this end thou hast put thy fear in our hearts to the
intent that we should call upon thy name and praise thee in our
captivity for we are converted from the iniquity of our fathers who
sinned before thee
and behold we are at this day in our captivity whereby thou hast
scattered us to be a reproach and a curse and an offence according to
all the iniquities of our fathers who departed from thee o lord our
hear o israel the commandments of life give ear that thou mayst
learn wisdom
how happeneth it o israel that thou art in thy enemies land
thou art grown old in a strange country thou art defiled with the
dead thou art counted with them that go down into hell
thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom
for if thou hadst walked in the way of god thou hadst surely
dwelt in peace for ever
learn where is wisdom where is strength where is understanding
that thou mayst know also where is length of days and life where is the
light of the eyes and peace
who hath found out her place and who hath gone in to her
treasures
where are the princes of the nations and they that rule over the
beasts that are upon the earth
that take their diversion with the birds of the air
that hoard up silver and gold wherein men trust and there is no
end of their getting who work in silver and are solicitous and their
works are unsearchable
they are cut off and are gone down to hell and others are risen
up in their place
young men have seen the light and dwelt upon the earth but the
way of knowledge they have not known
nor have they understood the paths thereof neither have their
children received it it is far from their face
it hath not been heard of in the land of chanaan neither hath it
been seen in theman
the children of agar also that search after the wisdom that is of
the earth the merchants of merrha and of theman and the tellers of
fables and searchers of prudence and understanding but the way of
wisdom they have not known neither have they remembered her paths
o israel how great is the house of god and how vast is the place
of his possession
it is great and hath no end it is high and immense
there were the giants those renowned men that were from the
beginning of great stature expert in war
the lord chose not them neither did they find the way of
knowledge therefore did they perish
and because they had not wisdom they perished through their
folly
who hath gone up into heaven and taken her and brought her down
from the clouds
who hath passed over the sea and found her and brought her
preferably to chosen gold
there is none that is able to know her ways nor that can search
out her paths
but he that knoweth all things knoweth her and hath found her
out with his understanding he that prepared the earth for evermore and
filled it with cattle and fourfooted beasts
he that sendeth forth the light and it goeth and hath called it
and it obeyeth him with trembling
and the stars have given light in their watches and rejoiced
they were called and they said here we are and with
cheerfulness they have shined forth to him that made them
this is our god and there shall no other be accounted of in
comparison of him
he found out all the way of knowledge and gave it to jacob his
servant and to israel his beloved
afterwards he was seen upon earth and conversed with men
means of which the son of god came visibly amongst us and conversed
with men the prophets often speak of things to come as if they were
past to express the certainty of the event of the things foretold
the people to be patient and to hope for their deliverance
this is the book of the commandments of god and the law that is
for ever all they that keep it shall come to life but they that have
forsaken it to death
return o jacob and take hold of it walk in the way by its
brightness in the presence of the light thereof
give not thy honour to another nor thy dignity to a strange
nation
we are happy o israel because the things that are pleasing to
be of good comfort o people of god the memorial of israel
you have been sold to the gentiles not for your destruction but
because you provoked god to wrath you are delivered to your
adversaries
for you have provoked him who made you the eternal god offering
sacrifice to devils and not to god
for you have forgotten god who brought you up and you have
grieved jerusalem that nursed you
for she saw the wrath of god coming upon you and she said give
ear all you that dwell near sion for god hath brought upon me great
mourning
for i have seen the captivity of my people of my sons and my
daughters which the eternal hath brought upon them
for i nourished them with joy but i sent them away with weeping
and mourning
let no man rejoice over me a widow and desolate i am forsaken
of many for the sins of my children because they departed from the law
of god
and they have not known his justices nor walked by the ways of
and justice
let them that dwell about sion come and remember the captivity of
my sons and daughters which the eternal hath brought upon them
for he hath brought a nation upon them from afar a wicked nation
and of a strange tongue
who have neither reverenced the ancient nor pitied children and
have carried away the beloved of the widow and have left me all alone
without children
but as for me what help can i give you
but he that hath brought the evils upon you he will deliver you
out of the hands of your enemies
go your way my children go your way for i am left alone
i have put off the robe of peace and have put upon me the
sackcloth of supplication and i will cry to the most high in my days
be of good comfort my children cry to the lord and he will
deliver you out of the hand of the princes your enemies
for my hope is in the eternal that he will save you and joy is
come upon me from the holy one because of the mercy which shall come to
you from our everlasting saviour
for i sent you forth with mourning and weeping but the lord will
bring you back to me with joy and gladness for ever
for as the neighbours of sion have now seen your captivity from
come upon you with great honour and everlasting glory
my children suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you for
thy enemy hath persecuted thee but thou shalt quickly see his
destruction and thou shalt get up upon his neck
my delicate ones have walked rough ways for they were taken away
as a flock made a prey by the enemies
be of good comfort my children and cry to the lord for you
shall be remembered by him that hath led you away
for as it was your mind to go astray from god so when you return
again you shall seek him ten times as much
for he that hath brought evils upon you shall bring you
everlasting joy again with your salvation
be of good heart o jerusalem for he exhorteth thee that named
thee
the wicked that have afflicted thee shall perish and they that
have rejoiced at thy ruin shall be punished
the cities which thy children have served shall be punished and
she that received thy sons
for as she rejoiced at thy ruin and was glad of thy fall so
shall she be grieved for her own desolation
and the joy of her multitude shall be cut off and her gladness
shall be turned to mourning
for fire shall come upon her from the eternal long to endure and
she shall be inhabited by devils for a great time
look about thee o jerusalem towards the east and behold the joy
that cometh to thee from god
for behold thy children come whom thou sentest away scattered
they come gathered together from the east even to the west at the word
of the holy one rejoicing for the honour of god
out of their captivity
put off o jerusalem the garment of thy mourning and affliction
and put on the beauty and honour of that everlasting glory which thou
hast from god
god will clothe thee with the double garment of justice and will
set a crown on thy head of everlasting honour
for god will shew his brightness in thee to every one under
heaven
for thy name shall be named to thee by god for ever the peace of
justice and honour of piety
arise o jerusalem and stand on high and look about towards the
east and behold thy children gathered together from the rising to the
setting sun by the word of the holy one rejoicing in the remembrance of
for they went out from thee on foot led by the enemies but the
kingdom
for god hath appointed to bring down every high mountain and the
everlasting rocks and to fill up the valleys to make them even with the
ground that israel may walk diligently to the honour of god
moreover the woods and every sweetsmelling tree have overshadowed
for god will bring israel with joy in the light of his majesty
with mercy and justice that cometh from him
idolatry
away captives into babylon by the king of babylon to declare to them
according to what was commanded him by god
for the sins that you have committed before god you shall be
carried away captives into babylon by nabuchodonosor the king of
and when you are come into babylon you shall be there many years
and for a long time even to seven generations and after that i will
bring you away from thence with peace
but now you shall see in babylon gods of gold and of silver and
of stone and of wood borne upon shoulders causing fear to the
beware therefore that you imitate not the doings of others and be
afraid and the fear of them should seize upon you
but when you see the multitude behind and before adoring them
say you in your hearts thou oughtest to be adored o lord
for my angel is with you and i myself will demand an account of
your souls
for their tongue that is polished by the craftsman and themselves
laid over with gold and silver are false things and they cannot speak
and as if it were for a maiden that loveth to go gay so do they
take gold and make them up
their gods have golden crowns upon their heads whereof the priests
secretly convey away from them gold and silver and bestow it on
themselves
yea and they give thereof to prostitutes and they dress out
harlots and again when they receive it of the harlots they adorn their
gods
and these gods cannot defend themselves from the rust and the
moth
but when they have covered them with a purple garment they wipe
their face because of the dust of the house which is very much among
them
this holdeth a sceptre as a man as a judge of the country but
cannot put to death one that offendeth him
and this hath in his hand a sword or an axe but cannot save
himself from war or from robbers whereby be it known to you that they
are not gods
therefore fear them not for as a vessel that a man uses when it
is broken becometh useless even so are their gods
when they are placed in the house their eyes are full of dust by
the feet of them that go in
and as the gates are made sure on every side upon one that hath
offended the king or like a dead man carried to the grave so do the
priests secure the doors with bars and locks lest they be stripped by
thieves
they light candles to them and in great number of which they
cannot see one but they are like beams in the house
and they say that the creeping things which are of the earth gnaw
their hearts while they eat them and their garments and they feel it
not
their faces are black with the smoke that is made in the house
owls and swallows and other birds fly upon their bodies and
upon their heads and cats in like manner
whereby you may know that they are no gods therefore fear them
not
the gold also which they have is for shew but except a man wipe
off the rust they will not shine for neither when they were molten
did they feel it
men buy them at a high price whereas there is no breath in them
and having not the use of feet they are carried upon shoulders
declaring to men how vile they are be they confounded also that worship
them
therefore if they fall to the ground they rise not up again of
themselves nor if a man set them upright will they stand by
themselves but their gifts shall be set before them as to the dead
the things that are sacrificed to them their priests sell and
abuse in like manner also their wives take part of them but give
nothing of it either to the sick or to the poor
the childbearing and menstruous women touch their sacrifices
knowing therefore by these things that they are not gods fear them
not
for how can they be called gods because women set offerings
before the gods of silver and of gold and of wood
and priests sit in their temples having their garments rent and
their heads and beards shaven and nothing upon their heads
and they roar and cry before their gods as men do at the feast
when one is dead
the priests take away their garments and clothe their wives and
their children
and whether it be evil that one doth unto them or good they are
not able to recompense it neither can they set up a king nor put him
down
in like manner they can neither give riches nor requite evil if
a man make a vow to them and perform it not they cannot require it
they cannot deliver a man from death nor save the weak from the
mighty
they cannot restore the blind man to his sight nor deliver a man
from distress
they shall not pity the widow nor do good to the fatherless
their gods of wood and of stone and of gold and of silver are
like the stones that are hewn out of the mountains and they that
worship them shall be confounded
how then is it to be supposed or to be said that they are gods
even the chaldeans themselves dishonor them who when they here of
one dumb that cannot speak they present him to bel entreating him
that he may speak
as though they could be sensible that have no motion themselves
and they when they shall perceive this will leave them for their gods
themselves have no sense
the women also with cords about them sit in the ways burning
olivestones
and when any one of them drawn away by some passenger lieth with
him she upbraideth her neighbor that she was not thought as worthy as
herself nor her cord broken
but all things that are done about them are false how is it then
to be thought or to be said that they are gods
and they are made by workmen and by goldsmiths they shall be
nothing else but what the priests will have them to be
for the artificers themselves that make them are of no long
continuance can those things then that are made by them be gods
but they have left false things and reproach to them that come
after
for when war cometh upon them or evils the priests consult with
themselves where they may hide themselves with them
how then can they be thought to be gods that can neither deliver
themselves from war nor save themselves from evils
for seeing they are but of wood and laid over with gold and with
silver it shall be known hereafter that they are false things by all
nations and kings and it shall be manifest that they are no gods but
the work of mens hands and that there is no work of god in them
whence therefore is it known that they are not gods but the
work of mens hands and no work of god is in them
they cannot set up a king over the land nor give rain to men
they determine no causes nor deliver countries from oppression
because they can do nothing and are as daws between heaven and earth
for when fire shall fall upon the house of these gods of wood and
of silver and of gold their priests indeed will flee away and be
saved but they themselves shall be burnt in the midst like beams
and they cannot withstand a king and war how then can it be
supposed or admitted that they are gods
neither are these gods of wood and of stone and laid over with
gold and with silver able to deliver themselves from thieves or
robbers they that are stronger than them
stronger than these idols being things without life or motion
shall take from them the gold and silver and the raiment
wherewith they are clothed and shall go their way neither shall they
help themselves
therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power or
else a profitable vessel in the house with which the owner thereof will
be well satisfied or a door in the house to keep things safe that are
therein than such false gods
the sun and the moon and the stars being bright and sent forth
for profitable uses are obedient
in like manner the lightning when it breaketh forth is easy to
be seen and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country
and the clouds when god commandeth them to go over the whole
world do that which is commanded them
the fire also being sent from above to consume mountains and
woods doth as it is commanded but these neither in shew nor in power
are alike to any one of them
wherefore it is neither to be thought nor to be said that they
are gods since they are neither able to judge causes nor to do any
good to men
knowing therefore that they are not gods fear them not
for neither can they curse kings nor bless them
neither do they shew signs in the heaven to the nations nor shine
as the sun nor give light as the moon
beasts are better than they which can fly under a covert and
help themselves
therefore there is no manner of appearance that they are gods so
fear them not
for as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing so
are their gods of wood and of silver and laid over with gold
they are no better than a white thorn in a garden upon which
every bird sitteth in like manner also their gods of wood and laid
over with gold and with silver are like to a dead body cast forth in
the dark
by the purple also and the scarlet which are motheaten upon them
you shall know that they are not gods and they themselves at last are
consumed and shall be a reproach in the country
better therefore is the just man that hath no idols for he
shall be far from reproach
race and of the number of captives that were carried away to babylon
with king joachin he was contemporary with jeremias and prophesied to
the same effect in babylon as jeremias did in jerusalem and is said to
have ended his days in like manner by martyrdom
