blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the
ungodly nor stood in the way of sinners nor sat in the chair of
pestilence
but his will is in the law of the lord and on his law he shall
meditate day and night
and he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running
waters which shall bring forth its fruit in due season and his leaf
shall not fall off and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper
not so the wicked not so but like the dust which the wind
driveth from the face of the earth
therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment nor sinners
in the council of the just
for the lord knoweth the way of the just and the way of the wicked
shall perish
why have the gentiles raged and the people devised vain things
the kings of the earth stood up and the princes met together
against the lord and against his christ
let us break their bonds asunder and let us cast away their yoke
from us
he that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them and the lord shall
deride them
then shall he speak to them in his anger and trouble them in his
rage
but i am appointed king by him over sion his holy mountain
preaching his commandment
the lord hath said to me thou art my son this day have i begotten
thee
ask of me and i will give thee the gentiles for thy inheritance
and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession
thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron and shalt break them in
pieces like a potters vessel
and now o ye kings understand receive instruction you that
judge the earth
serve ye the lord with fear and rejoice unto him with trembling
embrace discipline lest at any time the lord be angry and you
perish from the just way
when his wrath shall be kindled in a short time blessed are all
they that trust in him
passion and resurrection of christ

but thou o lord art my protector my glory and the lifter up of
my head

his holy hill

in him

overcometh which some understand of the chief musician to whom they
suppose the psalms which bear that title were given to be sung we
rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to christ who is
the end of the law and the great conqueror of death and hell and to
the new testamentibid in verses in carminibus in the hebrew it
is neghinoth supposed by some to be a musical instrument with which
this psalm was to be sungibid for david or to david that is
inspired to david himself or to be sung

in distress thou hast enlarged me have mercy on me and hear my

for to thee will i pray o lord in the morning thou shalt hear my
voice
in the morning i will stand before thee and i will see because
thou art not a god that willest iniquity
neither shall the wicked dwell near thee nor shall the unjust
abide before thy eyes
thou hatest all the workers of iniquity thou wilt destroy all that
speak a lie the bloody and the deceitful man the lord will abhor
but as for me in the multitude of thy mercy i will come into thy
house i will worship towards thy holy temple in thy fear
conduct me o lord in thy justice because of my enemies direct
my way in thy sight
for there is no truth in their mouth their heart is vain
their throat is an open sepulchre they dealt deceitfully with
their tongues judge them o god let them fall from their devices
according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out for they
have provoked thee o lord
but let all them be glad that hope in thee they shall rejoice for
ever and thou shalt dwell in them and all they that love thy name
shall glory in thee
for thou wilt bless the just o lord thou hast crowned us as
with a shield of thy good will
penitential psalm
unto the end in verses a psalm for david for the octave
the world to come which is as it were the octave or eighth day
after the seven days of this mortal life and for this octave sinners
must dispose themselves like david by bewailing their sins whilst
they are here upon earth

wrath

bones are troubled

the voice of my weeping
the lord hath heard my supplication the lord hath received my
prayer

be turned back and be ashamed very speedily

o lord my god in thee have i put my trust same me from all them
that persecute me and deliver me

no one to redeem me nor to save

my hands
if i have rendered to them that repaid me evils let me deservedly
fall empty before my enemies

on the earth and bring down my glory to the dust
rise up o lord in thy anger and be thou exalted in the borders
of my enemies and arise o lord my god in the precept which thou hast
commanded

except you will be converted he will brandish his sword he hath
bent his bow and made it ready
and in it he hath prepared to instruments of death he hath made
ready his arrows for them that burn
behold he hath been in labour with injustice he hath conceived
sorrow and brought forth iniquity
he hath opened a pit and dug it and he is fallen into the hole he
made

come down upon his crown

sing to the name of the lord the most high
by the incarnation of christ

o lord our lord how admirable is thy name in the whole earth for
thy magnificence is elevated above the heavens
out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected
praise because of thy enemies that thou mayst destroy the enemy and
the avenger
for i will behold thy heavens the works of thy fingers the moon
and the stars which thou hast founded
what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that
thou visitest him
thou hast made him a little less than the angels thou hast crowned
him with glory and honour
and hast set him over the works of thy hands
thou hast subjected all things under his feet all sheep and oxen
moreover the beasts also of the fields
the birds of the air and the fishes of the sea that pass through
the paths of the sea
o lord our lord how admirable is thy name in the whole earth
against her enemies
unto the end for the hidden things of the son a psalm for david
the son of god and of good christians who are his sons by adoption
are called hidden things with regard to the children of this world who
know not the value and merit of them
i will give praise to thee o lord with my whole heart i will
relate all thy wonders
i will be glad and rejoice in thee i will sing to thy name o thou
most high
when my enemy shall be turned back they shall be weakened and
perish before thy face
for thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause thou hast sat on
the throne who judgest justice
thou hast rebuked the gentiles and the wicked one hath perished
thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever
the swords of the enemy have failed unto the end and their cities
thou hast destroyed their memory hath perished with a noise
but the lord remaineth for ever he hath prepared his throne in
judgment
and he shall judge the world in equity he shall judge the people
in justice
and the lord is become a refuge for the poor a helper in due time
in tribulation

forsaken them that seek thee o lord

forgotten the cry of the poor

my enemies
thou that liftest me up from the gates of death that i may
declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of sion
i will rejoice in thy salvation the gentiles have stuck fast in
the destruction which they prepared their foot hath been taken in the
very snare which they hid
the lord shall be known when he executeth judgments the sinner
hath been caught in the works of his own hands
the wicked shall be turned into hell all the nations that forget
for the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end the patience
of the poor shall not perish for ever
arise o lord let not man be strengthened let the gentiles be
judged in thy sight
appoint o lord a lawgiver over them that the gentiles may know
themselves to be but men
the beginning of psalm and again they join psalms and into
one in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed and
in this manner the psalms are numbered in the protestant bible
psalm chapter according to the hebrews
why o lord hast thou retired afar off why dost thou slight us in
our wants in the time of trouble
whilst the wicked man is proud the poor is set on fire they are
caught in the counsels which they devise
for the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul and the
unjust man is blessed
the sinner hath provoked the lord according to the multitude of
his wrath he will not seek him
god is not before his eyes his ways are filthy at all times thy
judgments are removed form his sight he shall rule over all his
enemies
for he hath said in his heart i shall not be moved from generation
to generation and shall be without evil
his mouth is full of cursing and of bitterness and of deceit
under his tongue are labour and sorrow
he sitteth in ambush with the rich in private places that he may
kill the innocent
his eyes are upon the poor man he lieth in wait in secret like a
lion in his den he lieth in ambush that he may catch the poor man so
catch the poor whilst he draweth him to him
in his net he will bring him down he will crouch and fall when
he shall have power over the poor
for he hath said in his heart god hath forgotten he hath turned
away his face not to see to the end
arise o lord god let thy hand be exalted forget not the poor
wherefore hath the wicked provoked god for he hath said in his
heart he will not require it
thou seest it for thou considerest labour and sorrow that thou
mayst deliver them into thy hands to thee is the poor man left thou
wilt be a helper to the orphan
break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant his sin
shall be sought and shall not be found
the lord shall reign to eternity yea for ever and ever ye
the lord hath heard the desire of the poor thy ear hath heard the
preparation of their heart
to judge for the fatherless and for the humble that man may no
more presume to magnify himself upon earth
unto the end a psalm to david
in the lord i put my trust how then do you say to my soul get
thee away from hence to the mountain like a sparrow
for lo the wicked have bent their bow they have prepared their
arrows in the quiver to shoot in the dark the upright of heart
for they have destroyed the things which thou hast made but what
has the just man done
the lord is in his holy temple the lords throne is in heaven
the lord trieth the just and the wicked but he that loveth
iniquity hateth his own soul
he shall rain snares upon sinners fire and brimstone and storms
of winds shall be the portion of their cup
for the lord is just and hath loved justice his countenance hath
beheld righteousness
unto the end for the octave a psalm for david
save me o lord for there is now no saint truths are decayed
from among the children of men
they have spoken vain things every one to his neighbour with
deceitful lips and with a double heart have they spoken
may the lord destroy all deceitful lips and the tongue that
speaketh proud things
who have said we will magnify our tongue our lips are our own
who is lord over us
by reason of the misery of the needy and the groans of the poor
now will i arise saith the lord i will set him in safety i will deal
confidently in his regard
the words of the lord are pure words as silver tried by the fire
purged from the earth refined seven times
thou o lord wilt preserve us and keep us from this generation
for ever
the wicked walk round about according to thy highness thou hast
multiplied the children of men
unto the end a psalm for david how long o lord wilt thou
forget me unto the end how long dost thou turn away thy face from me
how long shall i take counsels in my soul sorrow in my heart all
the day
how long shall my enemy be exalted over me
consider and hear me o lord my god enlighten my eyes that i
never sleep in death
lest at any time my enemy say i have prevailed against him they
that trouble me will rejoice when i am moved
but i have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy
salvation i will sing to the lord who giveth me good things yea i
will sing to the name of the lord the most high
unto the end a psalm for david the fool hath said in his heart
ways there is none that doth good no not one
the lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men to
see if there be any that understand and seek god
they are all gone aside they are become unprofitable together
there is none that doth good no not one their throat is an open
sepulchre with their tongues they acted deceitfully the poison of asps
is under their lips their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
their feet are swift to shed blood destruction and unhappiness in their
ways and the way of peace they have not known there is no fear of god
before their eyes
shall not all they know that work iniquity who devour my people
as they eat bread
they have not called upon the lord there have they trembled for
fear where there was no fear
for the lord is in the just generation you have confounded the
counsel of the poor man but the lord is his hope
who shall give out of sion the salvation of israel when the lord
shall have turned away the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice
and israel shall be glad
a psalm for david lord who shall dwell in thy tabernacle or who
shall rest in thy holy hill
he that walketh without blemish and worketh justice
he that speaketh truth in his heart who hath not used deceit in
his tongue nor hath done evil to his neighbour nor taken up a reproach
against his neighbours
in his sight the malignant is brought to nothing but he
glorifieth them that fear the lord he that sweareth to his neighbour
and deceiveth not
he that hath not put out his money to usury nor taken bribes
against the innocent he that doth these things shall not be moved for
ever
the inscription of a title to david himself preserve me o lord
for i have put my trust in thee
staylographia which is as much as to say that this psalm is most
worthy to be engraved on an everlasting monument
i have said to the lord thou art my god for thou hast no need of
my goods
to the saints who are in his land he hath made wonderful all my
desires in them
their infirmities were multiplied afterwards they made haste i
will not gather together their meetings for bloodofferings nor will i
be mindful of their names by my lips
the lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup it is
thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me
the lines are fallen unto me in goodly places for my inheritance
is goodly to me
i will bless the lord who hath given me understanding moreover
my reins also have corrected me even till night
i set the lord always in my sight for he is at my right hand
that i be not moved
therefore my heart hath been glad and my tongue hath rejoiced
moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell nor wilt thou give
thy holy one to see corruption
thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt fill me
with joy with thy countenance at thy right hand are delights even to
the end
the prayer of david hear o lord my justice attend to my
supplication give ear unto my prayer which proceedeth not from
deceitful lips
let my judgment come forth from thy countenance let thy eyes
behold the things that are equitable
thou hast proved my heart and visited it by night thou hast
tried me by fire and iniquity hath not been found in me
that my mouth may not speak the works of men for the sake of the
words of thy lips i have kept hard ways
perfect thou my goings in thy paths that my footsteps be not
moved
i have cried to thee for thou o god hast heard me o incline
thy ear unto me and hear my words
shew forth thy wonderful mercies thou who savest them that trust
in thee
from them that resist thy right hand keep me as the apple of thy
eye protect me under the shadow of thy wings
from the face of the wicked who have afflicted me my enemies have
surrounded my soul
they have shut up their fat their mouth hath spoken proudly
me
they have cast me forth and now they have surrounded me they
have set their eyes bowing down to the earth
they have taken me as a lion prepared for the prey and as a
young lion dwelling in secret places
arise o lord disappoint him and supplant him deliver my soul
from the wicked one thy sword
from the enemies of thy hand o lord divide them from the few of
the earth in their life their belly is filled from thy hidden stores
rest of their substance
and the few trifling things thereof which they are so proud of or
divide them from the few that is from thy elect who are but few that
they may no longer have it in their power to oppress them it is not
meant by way of a curse or imprecation but as many other the like
passages in the psalms by way of a prediction or prophecy of what
should come upon them in punishment of their wickedness ibid thy
hidden stores thy secret treasures out of which thou furnishest
those earthly goods which with a bountiful hand thou hast distributed
both to the good and the bad
but as for me i will appear before thy sight in justice i shall
be satisfied when thy glory shall appear
unto the end for david the servant of the lord who spoke to the
from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of saul and he
said
i will love thee o lord my strength
the lord is my firmament my refuge and my deliverer my god is
my helper and in him will i put my trust my protector and the horn of
my salvation and my support
praising i will call upon the lord and i shall be saved from my
enemies
the sorrows of death surrounded me and the torrents of iniquity
troubled me
the sorrows of hell encompassed me and the snares of death
prevented me
in my affliction i called upon the lord and i cried to my god
into his ears
the earth shook and trembled the foundations of the mountains
were troubled and were moved because he was angry with them
there went up a smoke in his wrath and a fire flamed from his
face coals were kindled by it
he bowed the heavens and came down and darkness was under his
feet
and he ascended upon the cherubim and he flew he flew upon the
wings of the winds
and he made darkness his covert his pavilion round about him
dark waters in the clouds of the air
at the brightness that was before him the clouds passed hail and
coals of fire
and the lord thundered from heaven and the highest gave his
voice hail and coals of fire
and he sent forth his arrows and he scattered them he
multiplied lightnings and troubled them
then the fountains of waters appeared and the foundations of the
world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the spirit
of thy wrath
he sent from on high and took me and received me out of many
waters
he delivered me from my strongest enemies and from them that
hated me for they were too strong for me
they prevented me in the day of my affliction and the lord
became my protector
and he brought me forth into a large place he saved me because
he was well pleased with me
and the lord will reward me according to my justice and will
repay me according to the cleanness of my hands
because i have kept the ways of the lord and have not done
wickedly against my god
for all his judgments are in my sight and his justices i have
not put away from me
and i shall be spotless with him and shall keep myself from my
iniquity
and the lord will reward me according to my justice and
according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes
with the holy thou wilt be holy and with the innocent man thou
wilt be innocent
and withe the elect thou wilt be elect and with the perverse
thou wilt be perverted
for thou wilt save the humble people but wilt bring down the
eyes of the proud
for thou lightest my lamp o lord o my god enlighten my
darkness
for by thee i shall be delivered from temptation and through my
as for my god his way is undefiled the words of the lord are
firetried he is the protector of all that trust in him
for who is god but the lord or who is god but our god
god who hath girt me with strength and made my way blameless
who hath made my feet like the feet of harts and who setteth me
upon high places
who teacheth my hands to war and thou hast made my arms like a
brazen bow
and thou hast given me the protection of thy salvation and thy
right hand hath held me up and thy discipline hath corrected me unto
the end and thy discipline the same shall teach me
thou hast enlarged my steps under me and my feet are not
weakened
i will pursue after my enemies and overtake them and i will not
turn again till they are consumed
i will break them and they shall not be able to stand they
shall fall under my feet
and thou hast girded me with strength unto battle and hast
subdued under me them that rose up against me
and thou hast made my enemies furn their back upon me and hast
destroyed them that hated me
they cried but there was none to save them to the lord but he
heard them not
and i shall beat them as small as the dust before the wind i
shall bring them to nought like the dirt in the streets
thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people thou
wilt make me head of the gentiles
a people which i knew not hath served me at the hearing of the
ear they have obeyed me
the children that are strangers have lied to me strange children
have faded away and have halted from their paths
the lord liveth and blessed by my god and let the god of my
salvation be exalted
o god who avengest me and subduest the people under me my
deliverer from my enraged enemies
and thou wilt lift me up above them that rise up against me from
the unjust man thou wilt deliver me
therefore will i give glory to thee o lord among the nations
and i will sing a psalm to thy name
giving great deliverance to his king and shewing mercy to david
his anointed and to his seed for ever

the heavens shew forth the glory of god and the firmament
declareth the work of his hands
day to day uttereth speech and night to night sheweth knowledge
there are no speeches nor languages where their voices are not
heard
their sound hath gone forth into all the earth and their words
unto the ends of the world
he hath set his tabernacle in the sun and he as a bridegroom
coming out of his bridechamber hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way
his going out is from the end of heaven and his circuit even to
the end thereof and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat
the law of the lord is unspotted converting souls the testimony
of the lord is faithful giving wisdom to little ones

for thy servant keepeth them and in keeping them there is a
great reward
who can understand sins from my secret ones cleanse me o lord
and from those of others spare thy servant if they shall have no
dominion over me then shall i be without spot and i shall be cleansed
form the greatest sin
and the words of my mouth shall be such as may please and the
meditation of my heart always in thy sight o lord my helper and my

from him the will of his lips
for thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness thou hast
set on his head a crown of precious stones

ever and ever
his glory is great in thy salvation glory and great beauty shalt
thou lay upon him

shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance
for the king hopeth in the lord and through the mercy of the most
let thy hand be found by all thy enemies let thy right hand find
out all them that hate thee

anger the lord shall trouble them in his wrath and fire shall devour
them
their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed
from among the children of men
for they have intended evils against thee they have devised
counsels which they have not been able to establish
for thou shalt make them turn their back in thy remnants thou
shalt prepare their face
remnants against their faces that is thou shalt make them see what
punishments remain for them hereafter from thy justice instead of
remnants st jerome renders it funes that is cords or strings viz
of the bow of divine justice from which god directs his arrows against

praise thy power
unto the end for the morning protection a psalm for david
o god my god look upon me why hast thou forsaken me far from my
salvation are the words of my sins
taken upon myself cry out against me and are the cause of all my
sufferings
o my god i shall cry by day and thou wilt not hear and by
night and it shall not be reputed as folly in me
but thou dwellest in the holy place the praise of israel
in thee have our fathers hoped they have hoped and thou hast
delivered them
they cried to thee and they were saved they trusted in thee and
were not confounded
but i am a worm and no man the reproach of men and the outcast
of the people
all they that saw me have laughed me to scorn they have spoken
with the lips and wagged the head
he hoped in the lord let him deliver him let him save him
seeing he delighteth in him
for thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb my hope from
the breasts of my mother
i was cast upon thee from the womb from my mothers womb thou
art my god
depart not from me for tribulation is very near for there is
none to help me
many calves have surrounded me fat bulls have besieged me
they have opened their mouths against me as a lion ravening and
roaring
i am poured out like water and all my bones are scattered my
heart is become like wax melting in the midst of my bowels
my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue hath
cleaved to my jaws and thou hast brought me down into the dust of
death
for many dogs have encompassed me the council of the malignant
hath besieged me they have dug my hands and feet
they have numbered all my bones and they have looked and stared
upon me
they parted my garments amongst them and upon my vesture they
cast lots
but thou o lord remove not thy help to a distance from me look
towards my defence
deliver o god my soul from the sword my only one from the hand
of the dog
save me from the lions mouth and my lowness from the horns of

they that go down to the earth shall fall before him
and to him my soul shall live and my seed shall serve him
there shall be declared to the lord a generation to come and the
heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born
which the lord hath made
a psalm for david the lord ruleth me and i shall want nothing
me
he hath set me in a place of pasture he hath brought me up on
the water of refreshment
he hath converted my soul he hath led me on the paths of justice
for his own names sake

will fear no evils for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they
have comforted me

soul in vain nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour

unto the end a psalm for david to thee o lord have i lifted up
my soul
in thee o my god i put my trust let me not be ashamed

direct me in thy truth and teach me for thou art god my saviour
and on thee have i waited all the day long
remember o lord thy bowels of compassion and thy mercies that
are from the beginning of the world
the sins of my youth and my ignorances do not remember according
to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake o lord
the lord is sweet and righteous therefore he will give a law to
sinners in the way
he will guide the mild in judgment he will teach the meek his
ways
all the ways of the lord are mercy and truth to them that seek
after his covenant and his testimonies
for thy names sake o lord thou wilt pardon my sin for it is
great
who is the man that feareth the lord he hath appointed him a law
in the way he hath chosen
his soul shall dwell in good things and his seed shall inherit
the land
the lord is a firmament to them that fear him and his covenant
shall be made manifest to them
my eyes are ever towards the lord for he shall pluck my feet out
of the snare
look thou upon me and have mercy on me for i am alone and poor
the troubles of my heart are multiplied deliver me from my
necessities
see my abjection and my labour and forgive me all my sins

walked in my innocence and i have put my trust in the lord and shall
not be weakened
prove me o lord and try me burn my reins and my heart
for thy mercy is before my eyes and i am well pleased with thy
truth
i have not sat with the council of vanity neither will i go in
with the doers of unjust things
i have hated the assembly of the malignant and with the wicked i
will not sit
i will wash my hands among the innocent and will compass thy
altar o lord
that i may hear the voice of thy praise and tell of all thy
wondrous works
i have loved o lord the beauty of thy house and the place where
thy glory dwelleth
take not away my soul o god with the wicked nor my life with
bloody men
in whose hands are iniquities their right hand is filled with
gifts
but as for me i have walked in my innocence redeem me and have
mercy on me
my foot hath stood in the direct way in the churches i will
bless thee o lord
the psalm of david before he was anointed the lord is my light
and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the protector of my
life of whom shall i be afraid
whilst the wicked draw near against me to eat my flesh my
enemies that trouble me have themselves been weakened and have fallen
if armies in camp should stand together against me my heart
shall not fear if a battle should rise up against me in this will i be
confident
one thing i have asked of the lord this will i seek after that i
may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life that i may
see the delight of the lord and may visit his temple
for he hath hidden me in his tabernacle in the day of evils he
hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle
he hath exalted me upon a rock and now he hath lifted up my head
above my enemies i have gone round and have offered up in his
tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation i will sing and recite a psalm to
the lord
hear o lord my voice with which i have cried to thee have
mercy on me and hear me
my heart hath said to thee my face hath sought thee thy face o
turn not away thy face from me decline not in thy wrath from thy
servant be thou my helper forsake me not do not thou despise me o
for my father and my mother have left me but the lord hath taken
me up
set me o lord a law in thy way and guide me in the right path
because of my enemies
deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me for
unjust witnesses have risen up against me and iniquity hath lied to
itself
i believe to see the good things of the lord in the land of the
living
expect the lord do manfully and let thy heart take courage and
wait thou for the lord
a psalm for david himself unto thee will i cry o lord o my god
be not thou silent to me lest if thou be silent to me i become like
them that go down into the pit
hear o lord the voice of my supplication when i pray to thee
when i lift up my hands to thy holy temple
draw me not away together with the wicked and with the workers of
iniquity destroy me not who speak peace with their neighbour but evils
are in their hearts
give them according to their works and according to the
wickedness of their inventions according to the works of their hands
give thou to them render to them their reward
because they have not understood the works of the lord and the
operations of his hands thou shalt destroy them and shalt not build
them up
blessed be the lord for he hath heard the voice of my
supplication
the lord is my helper and my protector in him hath my heart
confided and i have been helped and my flesh hath flourished again
and with my will i will give praise to him
the lord is the strength of his people and the protector of the
salvation of his anointed
save o lord thy people and bless thy inheritance and rule them
and exalt them for ever
a psalm for david at the finishing of the tabernacle bring to
the lord o ye children of god bring to the lord the offspring of rams
bring to the lord glory and honour bring to the lord glory to his
name adore ye the lord in his holy court
the voice of the lord is upon the waters the god of majesty hath
thundered the lord is upon many waters
the voice of the lord is in power the voice of the lord in
magnificence
the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars yea the lord shall
break the cedars of libanus
and shall reduce them to pieces as a calf of libanus and as the
beloved son of unicorns
like a calf the psalmist here describes the effects of thunder which
he calls the voice of the lord which sometimes breaks down the tallest
and strongest trees and makes their broken branches skip etc all this
is to be understood mystically of the powerful voice of gods word in
his church which has broken the pride of the great ones of this world
and brought many of them meekly and joyfully to submit their necks to
the sweet yoke of christ
the voice of the lord divideth the flame of fire
the voice of the lord shaketh the desert and the lord shall shake
the desert of cades
the voice of the lord prepareth the stags and he will discover
the thick woods and in his temple all shall speak his glory
the lord maketh the flood to dwell and the lord shall sit king
for ever the lord will give strength to his people the lord will bless
his people with peace
him
a psalm of a canticle at the dedication of davids house
i will extol thee o lord for thou hast upheld me and hast not
made my enemies to rejoice over me
o lord my god i have cried to thee and thou hast healed me
thou hast brought forth o lord my soul from hell thou hast
saved me from them that go down into the pit
sing to the lord o ye his saints and give praise to the memory
of his holiness
for wrath is in his indignation and life in his good will in the
evening weeping shall have place and in the morning gladness
and in my abundance i said i shall never be moved
o lord in thy favour thou gavest strength to my beauty thou
turnedst away thy face from me and i became troubled
to thee o lord will i cry and i will make supplication to my
what profit is there in my blood whilst i go down to corruption
the lord hath heard and hath had mercy on me the lord became my
helper
thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy thou hast cut my
sackcloth and hast compassed me with gladness
to the end that my glory may sing to thee and i may not regret
unto the end a psalm for david in an ecstasy
in thee o lord have i hoped let me never be confounded deliver
me in thy justice
bow down thy ear to me make haste to deliver me be thou unto me
a god a protector and a house of refuge to save me
for thou art my strength and my refuge and for thy names sake
thou wilt lead me and nourish me
thou wilt bring me out of this snare which they have hidden for
me for thou art my protector
into thy hands i commend my spirit thou hast redeemed me o lord
the god of truth
thou hast hated them that regard vanities to no purpose but i
have hoped in the lord
i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast regarded my
humility thou hast saved my soul out of distresses
and thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy thou hast
set my feet in a spacious place
have mercy on me o lord for i am afflicted my eye is troubled
with wrath my soul and my belly
for my life is wasted with grief and my years in sighs my
strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed
i am become a reproach among all my enemies and very much to my
neighbours and a fear to my acquaintance they that saw me without fled
from me
i am forgotten as one dead from the heart i am become as a
vessel that is destroyed
for i have heard the blame of many that dwell round about while
they assembled together against me they consulted to take away my life
but i have put my trust in thee o lord i said thou art my god
my lots are in thy hands deliver me out of the hands of my
enemies and from them that persecute me
make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me in thy mercy
let me not be confounded o lord for i have called upon thee
let deceitful lips be made dumb which speak iniquity against the
just with pride and abuse
o how great is the multitude of thy sweetness o lord which thou
hast hidden for them that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them
that hope in thee in the sight of the sons of men
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face from the
disturbance of men thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle from the
contradiction of tongues
blessed be the lord for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me
in a fortified city
but i said in the excess of my mind i am cast away from before
thy eyes therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer when i cried
to thee
o love the lord all ye his saints for the lord will require
truth and will repay them abundantly that act proudly
do ye manfully and let your heart be strengthened all ye that
hope in the lord
to david himself understanding blessed are they whose iniquities
are forgiven and whose sins are covered
blessed is the man to whom the lord hath not imputed sin and in
whose spirit there is no guile
because i was silent my bones grew old whilst i cried out all the
day long
concealing or refusing to confess my sins thy hand was heavy upon me
etc
for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me i am turned in my
anguish whilst the thorn is fastened
ease in my pain whilst the thorn of thy justice pierces my flesh and
sticks fast in me or i am turned that is i am converted to thee my
the hebrew it is my moisture is turned into the droughts of the summer
i have acknowledged my sin to thee and my injustice i have not
concealed i said i will confess against my self my injustice to the
for this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a seasonable
time and yet in a flood of many waters they shall not come nigh unto
him
thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me my
joy deliver me from them that surround me
i will give thee understanding and i will instruct thee in this
way in which thou shalt go i will fix my eyes upon thee
do not become like the horse and the mule who have no
understanding with bit and bridle bind fast their jaws who come not
near unto thee
many are the scourges of the sinner but mercy shall encompass
him that hopeth in the lord
be glad in the lord and rejoice ye just and glory all ye
right of heart
a psalm for david rejoice in the lord o ye just praise becometh
the upright
give praise to the lord on the harp sing to him with the
psaltery the instrument of ten strings
sing to him a new canticle sing well unto him with a loud noise
for the word of the lord is right and all his works are done with
faithfulness
he loveth mercy and judgment the earth is full of the mercy of
the lord
by the word of the lord the heavens were established and all the
power of them by the spirit of his mouth
gathering together the waters of the sea as in a vessel laying
up the depths in storehouses
let all the earth fear the lord and let all the inhabitants of
the world be in awe of him
for he spoke and they were made he commanded and they were
created
the lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations and he
rejecteth the devices of people and casteth away the counsels of
princes
but the counsel of the lord standeth for ever the thoughts of
his heart to all generations
blessed is the nation whose god is the lord the people whom he
hath chosen for his inheritance
the lord hath looked from heaven he hath beheld all the sons of
men
from his habitation which he hath prepared he hath looked upon
all that dwell on the earth
he who hath made the hearts of every one of them who
understandeth all their works
the king is not saved by a great army nor shall the giant be
saved by his own great strength
vain is the horse for safety neither shall he be saved by the
abundance of his strength
behold the eyes of the lord are on them that fear him and on
them that hope in his mercy
to deliver their souls from death and feed them in famine
our soul waiteth for the lord for he is our helper and
protector
for in him our heart shall rejoice and in his holy name we have
trusted
let thy mercy o lord be upon us as we have hooped in thee
for david when he changed his countenance before achimelech who
dismissed him and he went his way kings
i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall be always in
my mouth
in the lord shall my soul be praised let the meek hear and
rejoice
o magnify the lord with me and let us extol his name together
i sought the lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all
my troubles
come ye to him and be enlightened and your faces shall not be
confounded
this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of
all his troubles
the angel of the lord shall encamp round about them that fear him
and shall deliver them
o taste and see that the lord is sweet blessed is the man that
hopeth in him
fear the lord all ye his saints for there is no want to them
that fear him
the rich have wanted and have suffered hunger but they that
seek the lord shall not be deprived of any good
come children hearken to me i will teach you the fear of the
who is the man that desireth life who liveth to see good days
keep thy tongue form evil and thy lips from speaking guile
turn away from evil and do good seek after peace and pursue it
the eyes of the lord are upon the just and his ears unto their
prayers
but the countenance of the lord is against them that do evil
things to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth
the just cried and the lord heard them and delivered them out
of all their troubles
the lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart and he
will save the humble of spirit
many are the afflictions of the just but out of them all will
the lord deliver them
the lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart and he
will save the humble of spirit
the death of the wicked is very evil and they that hate the just
shall be guilty
the lord will redeem the souls of his servants and none of them
that trust in him shall offend
prophetecally foreshewing the punishments that shall fall upon them
for david himself judge thou o lord them that wrong me
overthrow them that fight against me
take hold of arms and shield and rise up to help me
bring out the sword and shut up the way against them that
persecute me say to my soul i am thy salvation
let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul let
them be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me
let them become as dust before the wind and let the angel of the
let their way become dark and slippery and let the angel of the
for without cause they have hidden their net for me unto
destruction without cause they have upbraided my soul
let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him and let the net
which he hath hidden catch him and into that very snare let them fall
but my soul shall rejoice in the lord and shall be delighted in
his salvation
all my bones shall say lord who is like to thee who deliverest
the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he the needy and
the poor from them that strip him
unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things i knew not
they repaid me evil for good to the depriving me of my soul
but as for me when they were troublesome to me i was clothed
with haircloth i humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer shall be
turned into my bosom
as a neighbour and as an own brother so did i please as one
mourning and sorrowful so was i humbled
but they rejoiced against me and came together scourges were
gathered together upon me and i knew not
they were separated and repented not they tempted me they
scoffed at me with scorn they gnashed upon me with their teeth
lord when wilt thou look upon me rescue thou my soul from their
malice my only one from the lions
i will give thanks to thee in a great church i will praise thee
in a strong people
let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me who
have hated me without cause and wink with the eyes
for they spoke indeed peaceably to me and speaking in the anger
of the earth they devised guile
and they opened their mouth wide against me they said well
done well done our eyes have seen it
thou hast seen o lord be not thou silent o lord depart not
from me
arise and be attentive to my judgment to my cause my god and
my lord
judge me o lord my god according to thy justice and let them
not rejoice over me
let them not say in their hearts it is well it is well to our
mind neither let them say we have swallowed him up
let them blush and be ashamed together who rejoice at my
evils let them be clothed with confusion and shame who speak great
things against me
let them rejoice and be glad who are well pleased with my
justice and let them say always the lord be magnified who delights in
the peace of his servant
and my tongue shall meditate thy justice thy praise all the day
long
unto the end for the servant of god david himself
the unjust hath said within himself that he would sin there is
no fear of god before his eyes
for in his sight he hath done deceitfully that his iniquity may
be found unto hatred
the words of his mouth are iniquity and guile he would not
understand that he might do well
he hath devised iniquity on his bed he hath set himself on every
way that is not good but evil he hath not hated
o lord thy mercy is in heaven and thy truth reacheth even to the
clouds
thy justice is as the mountains of god thy judgments are a great
deep men and beasts thou wilt preserve o lord
o how hast thou multiplied thy mercy o god but the children of
men shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings
they shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house and thou
shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure
for with thee is the fountain of life and in thy light we shall
see light
extend thy mercy to them that know thee and thy justice to them
that are right in heart
let not the foot of pride come to me and let not the hand of the
sinner move me
there the workers of iniquity are fallen they are cast out and
could not stand
wicked and to trust in providence
be not emulous of evildoers nor envy them that work iniquity
for they shall shortly wither away as grass and as the green
herbs shall quickly fall
trust in the lord and do good and dwell in the land and thou
shalt be fed with its riches
delight in the lord and he will give thee the requests of thy
heart
commit thy way to the lord and trust in him and he will do it
and he will bring forth thy justice as the light and thy judgment
as the noonday
be subject to the lord and pray to him envy not the man who
prospereth in his way the man who doth unjust things
cease from anger and leave rage have no emulation to do evil
for evildoers shall be cut off but they that wait upon the lord
they shall inherit the land
for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be and thou
shalt seek his place and shalt not find it
but the meek shall inherit the land and shall delight in
abundance of peace
the sinner shall watch the just man and shall gnash upon him
with his teeth
but the lord shall laugh at him for he foreseeth that his day
shall come
the wicked have drawn out the sword they have bent their bow to
cast down the poor and needy to kill the upright of heart
let their sword enter into their own hearts and let their bow be
broken
better is a little to the just than the great riches of the
wicked
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces but the
the lord knoweth the days of the undefiled and their inheritance
shall be for ever
they shall not be confounded in the evil time and in the days of
famine they shall be filled
because the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the lord
presently after they shall be honoured and exalted shall come to
nothing and vanish like smoke
the sinner shall borrow and not pay again but the just sheweth
mercy and shall give
for such as bless him shall inherit the land but such as curse
him shall perish
with the lord shall the steps of a man be directed and he shall
like well his way
when he shall fall he shall not be bruised for the lord putteth
his hand under him
i have been young and now am old and i have not seen the just
forsaken nor his seed seeking bread
he sheweth mercy and lendeth all the day long and his seed
shall be in blessing
decline from evil and do good and dwell for ever and ever
for the lord loveth judgment and will not forsake his saints
they shall be preserved for ever the unjust shall be punished and the
seed of the wicked shall perish
but the just shall inherit the land and shall dwell therein for
evermore
the mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom and his tongue shall
speak judgment
the law of his god is in his heart and his steps shall not be
supplanted
the wicked watcheth the just man and seeketh to put him to
death
but the lord will not leave him in his hands nor condemn him
when he shall be judged
expect the lord and keep his way and he will exalt thee to
inherit the land when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see
i have seen the wicked highly exalted and lifted up like the
cedars of libanus
and i passed by and lo he was not and i sought him and his
place was not found
keep innocence and behold justice for there are remnants for
the peaceable man
but the unjust shall be destroyed together the remnants of the
wicked shall perish
but the salvation of the just is from the lord and he is their
protector in the time of trouble
and the lord will help them and deliver them and he will rescue
them from the wicked and save them because they have hoped in him
penitential psalm
a psalm for david for a remembrance of the sabbath
the sabbath day
rebuke me not o lord in thy indignation nor chastise me in thy
wrath
for thy arrows are fastened in me and thy hand hath been strong
upon me
there is no health in my flesh because of thy wrath there is no
peace for my bones because of my sins
for my iniquities are gone over my head and as a heavy burden are
become heavy upon me
my sores are putrified and corrupted because of my foolishness
i am become miserable and am bowed down even to the end i walked
sorrowful all the day long
for my loins are filled with illusions and there is no health in
my flesh
i am afflicted and humbled exceedingly i roared with the groaning
of my heart
lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hidden
from thee
my heart is troubled my strength hath left me and the light of
my eyes itself is not with me
my friends and my neighbours have drawn near and stood against
me and they that were near me stood afar off
and they that sought my soul used violence and they that sought
evils to me spoke vain things and studied deceits all the day long
but i as a deaf man heard not and as a dumb man not opening
his mouth
and i became as a man that heareth not and that hath no reproofs
in his mouth
for in thee o lord have i hoped thou wilt hear me o lord my
for i said lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me and
whilst my feet are moved they speak great things against me
for i am ready for scourges and my sorrow is continually before
me
for i will declare my iniquity and i will think for my sin
but my enemies live and are stronger than i and they that hate
me wrongfully are multiplied
they that render evil for good have detracted me because i
followed goodness
for sake me not o lord my god do not thou depart from me
attend unto my help o lord the god of my salvation
vanity of the world and the providence of god
unto the end for idithun himself a canticle of david
i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my
tongue i have set a guard to my mouth when the sinner stood against
me
i was dumb and was humbled and kept silence from good things
and my sorrow was renewed
my heart grew hot within me and in my meditation a fire shall
flame out
i spoke with my tongue o lord make me know my end and what is
the number of my days that i may know what is wanting to me
behold thou hast made my days measurable and my substance is as
nothing before thee and indeed all things are vanity every man living
surely man passeth as an image yea and he is disquieted in vain
and now what is my hope is it not the lord and my substance is
with thee
deliver thou me from all my iniquities thou hast made me a
reproach to the fool
i was dumb and i opened not my mouth because thou hast done it
remove thy scourges from me the strength of thy hand hath made
me faint in rebukes
thou hast corrected man for iniquity and thou hast made his soul
to waste away like a spider surely in vain is any man disquieted
hear my prayer o lord and my supplication give ear to my
tears be no silent for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as
all my fathers were
o forgive me that i may be refreshed before i go hence and be
no more
unto the end a psalm for david himself
with expectation i have waited for the lord and he was attentive
to me
and he heard my prayers and brought me out of the pit of misery
and the mire of dregs and he set my feet upon a rock and directed my
steps
and he put a new canticle into my mouth a song to our god many
shall see and shall fear and they shall hope in the lord
blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the lord and who
hath not had regard to vanities and lying follies
thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works o lord my god and in
thy thoughts there is no one like to thee i have declared and i have
spoken they are multiplied above number
sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire but thou hast
pierced ears for me burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not
require
then said i behold i come in the head of the book it is written
of me
that i should do thy will o my god i have desired it and thy
law in the midst of my heart
i have declared thy justice in a great church lo i will not
restrain my lips o lord thou knowest it
i have not hid thy justice within my heart i have declared thy
truth and thy salvation i have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth
from a great council
withhold not thou o lord thy tender mercies from me thy mercy
and thy truth have always upheld me
for evils without number have surrounded me my iniquities have
overtaken me and i was not able to see they are multiplied above the
hairs of my head and my heart hath forsaken me
upon me
be pleased o lord to deliver me look down o lord to help me
let them be confounded and ashamed together that seek after my
soul to take it away let them be turned backward and be ashamed that
desire evils to me
let them immediately bear their confusion that say to me tis
well tis well
t is well the hebrew here is an interjection of insult and derision
like the vah matt
let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such
as love thy salvation say always the lord be magnified
but i am a beggar and poor the lord is careful for me thou art
my helper and my protector o my god be not slack
humility and poverty in which he shall come the malice of his enemies
especially of the traitor judas
unto the end a psalm for david himself
blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the
poor the lord will deliver him in the evil day
the lord preserve him and give him life and make him blessed upon
the earth and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies
the lord help him on his bed of sorrow thou hast turned all his
couch in his sickness
i said o lord be thou merciful to me heal my soul for i have
sinned against thee
my enemies have spoken evils against me when shall he die and his
name perish
and if he came in to see me he spoke vain things his heart
gathered together iniquity to itself he went out and spoke to the same
purpose
all my enemies whispered together against me they devised evils
to me
they determined against me an unjust word shall he that sleepeth
rise again no more
for even the man of my peace in whom i trusted who ate my
bread hath greatly supplanted me
but thou o lord have mercy on me and raise my up again and i
will requite them
by this i know that thou hast had a good will for me because my
enemy shall not rejoice over me
but thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence and hast
established me in thy sight for ever
blessed be the lord the god of israel from eternity to eternity
unto the end understanding for the sons of core
as the hart panteth after the fountains of water so my soul
panteth after thee o god
my soul hath thirsted after the strong living god when shall i
come and appear before the face of god
my tears have been my bread day and night whilst it is said to me
daily where is thy god
these things i remembered and poured out my soul in me for i
shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle even to the
house of god with the voice of joy and praise the noise of one
feasting
why art thou sad o my soul and why dost thou trouble me hope in
countenance
and my god my soul is troubled within my self therefore will i
remember thee from the land of jordan and hermoniim from the little
hill
deep calleth on deep at the noise of thy floodgates all thy
heights and thy billows have passed over me
in the daytime the lord hath commanded his mercy and a canticle to
him in the night with me is prayer to the god of my life
i will say to god thou art my support why hast thou forgotten
me and why go i mourning whilst my enemy afflicteth me
whilst my bones are broken my enemies who trouble me have
reproached me whilst they say to me day by day where is thy god
why art thou cast down o my soul and why dost thou disquiet me
my countenance and my god
a psalm for david judge me o god and distinguish my cause from
the nation that is not holy deliver me from the unjust and deceitful
man
for thou art god my strength why hast thou cast me off and why
do i go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me
sent forth thy light and thy truth they have conducted me and
brought me unto thy holy hill and into thy tabernacles
and i will go in to the altar of god to god who giveth joy to my
youth
to thee o god my god i will give praise upon the harp why art
thou sad o my soul and why dost thou disquiet me
hope in god for i will still give praise to him the salvation
of my countenance and my god
which she prays for succour
unto the end for the sons of core to give understanding
we have heard o god with our ears our fathers have declared to
us the work thou hast wrought in their days and in the days of old
thy hand destroyed the gentiles and thou plantedst them thou
didst afflict the people and cast them out
for they got not the possession of the land by their own sword
neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thy arm and
the light of thy countenance because thou wast pleased with them
thou art thyself my king and my god who commandest the saving of
through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn and
through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us
for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me
but thou hast saved us from them that afflict us and hast put
them to shame that hate us
in god shall we glory all the day long and in thy name we will
give praise for ever
but now thou hast cast us off and put us to shame and thou
thou hast made us turn our back to our enemies and they that
hated us plundered for themselves
thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten thou hast scattered
us among the nations
thou hast sold thy people for no price and there was no
reckoning in the exchange of them
thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours a scoff and
derision to them that are round about us
thou hast made us a byword among the gentiles a shaking of the
head among the people
all the day long my shame is before me and the confusion of my
face hath covered me
at the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me at the
face of the enemy and persecutor
all these things have come upon us yet we have not forgotten
thee and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant
and our heart hath not turned back neither hast thou turned
aside our steps from thy way
for thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction and the
shadow of death hath covered us
if we have forgotten the name of our god and if we have spread
forth our hands to a strange god
shall not god search out these things for he knoweth the secrets
of the heart because for thy sake we are killed all the day long we
are counted as sheep for the slaughter
arise why sleepest thou o lord arise and cast us not off to
the end
why turnest thou thy face away and forgettest our want and our
trouble
for our soul is humbled down to the dust our belly cleaveth to
the earth
arise o lord help us and redeem us for thy names sake
unto the end for them that shall be changed for the sons of
being converted to godibid the beloved viz our lord jesus
my heart hath uttered a good word i speak my works to the king
thou art beautiful above the sons of men grace is poured abroad
in thy lips therefore hath god blessed thee for ever
gird thy sword upon thy thigh o thou most mighty
with thy comeliness and thy beauty set out proceed prosperously
and reign because of truth and meekness and justice and thy right hand
shall conduct thee wonderfully
thy arrows are sharp under thee shall people fall into the
hearts of the kings enemies
thy throne o god is forever and ever the sceptre of thy kingdom
is a sceptre of uprightness
thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity therefore god thy
myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments from the ivory
houses out of which
the daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory the
queen stood on thy right hand in gilded clothing surrounded with
variety
hearken o daughter and see and incline thy ear and forget thy
people and thy fathers house
and the king shall greatly desire thy beauty for he is the lord
thy god and him they shall adore
and the daughters of tyre with gifts yea all the rich among the
people shall entreat thy countenance
all the glory of the kings daughter is within in golden borders
clothed round about with varieties after her shall virgins be
brought to the king her neighbours shall be brought to thee
they shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing they shall be
brought into the temple of the king
instead of thy fathers sons are born to thee thou shalt make
them princes over all the earth
they shall remember thy name throughout all generations
unto the end for the sons of core for the hidden
our god is our refuge and strength a helper in troubles which
have found us exceedingly
therefore we will not fear when the earth shall be troubled and
the mountains shall be removed into the heart of the sea
their waters roared and were troubled the mountains were troubled
with his strength
the stream of the river maketh the city of god joyful the most
god is in the midst thereof it shall not be moved god will help
it in the morning early
nations were troubled and kingdoms were bowed down he uttered
his voice the earth trembled
the lord of armies is with us the god of jacob is our protector
come and behold ye the works of the lord what wonders he hath
done upon earth
making wars to cease even to the end of the earth he shall
destroy the bow and break the weapons and the shield he shall burn in
the fire
be still and see that i am god i will be exalted among the
nations and i will be exalted in the earth
the lord of armies is with us the god of jacob is our protector
kingdom of christ
unto the end for the sons of core
o clap your hands all ye nations shout unto god with the voice
of joy
for the lord is high terrible a great king over all the earth
he hath subdued the people under us and the nations under our
feet
he hath chosen for us his inheritance the beauty of jacob which
he hath love
god is ascended with jubilee and the lord with the sound of
trumpet
sing praises to our god sing ye sing praises to our king sing
ye
for god is the king of all the earth sing ye wisely
god shall reign over the nations god sitteth on his holy throne
the princes of the people are gathered together with the god of
a psalm of a canticle for the sons of core on the second day of
the week
great is the lord and exceedingly to be praised in the city of
our god in his holy mountain
with the joy of the whole earth is mount sion founded on the
sides of the north the city of the great king
in her houses shall god be known when he shall protect her
for behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves they
gathered together
so they saw and they wondered they were troubled they were
moved
trembling took hold of them there were pains as of a woman in
labour
with a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of
as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of
hosts in the city of our god god hath founded it for ever
we have received thy mercy o god in the midst of thy temple
according to thy name o god so also is thy praise unto the
ends of the earth thy right hand is full of justice
let mount sion rejoice and the daughters of juda be glad
because of thy judgments o lord
surround sion and encompass her tell lye in her towers
set your hearts on her strength and distribute her houses that
ye may relate it in another generation
for this is god our god unto eternity and for ever and ever he
shall rule us for evermore
or hell
unto the end a psalm for the sons of core
hear these things all ye nations give ear all ye inhabitants of
the world
all you that are earthborn and you sons of men both rich and
poor together
my mouth shall speak wisdom and the meditation of my heart
understanding
i will incline my ear to a parable i will open my proposition on
the psaltery
why shall i fear in the evil day the iniquity of my heel shall
encompass me
the iniquity of my pride with which as with the heel i have spurned
and kicked at my neighbours or the iniquity of my heel that is the
iniquity in which i shall be found in death the meaning of this verse
is why should i now indulge those passions and sinful affections or
commit now those sins which will cause me so much fear and anguish in
the evil day when the sorrows of death shall compass me and the perils
of hell shall find me
they that trust in their own strength and glory in the multitude
of their riches
their strength or riches for they have great reason to fear seeing no
brother or other man how much a friend soever can by any price or
labour rescue them from death
no brother can redeem nor shall man redeem he shall not give to
nor the price of the redemption of his soul and shall labour for
ever
foregoing sentence as much as to say no man can by any price or ransom
prolong his life that so he may still continue to labour here and live
to the end of the world others understand it of the eternal sorrows
and dying life of hell which is the dreadful consequence of dying in
sin
and shall still live unto the end
he shall not see destruction when he shall see the wise dying
the senseless and the fool shall perish together and they shall leave
their riches to strangers
not expect to escape when even the wise and the good are not exempt
from dying
and their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever their
dwelling places to all generations they have called their lands by
their names
graves which alone remain of their lands
and man when he was in honour did not understand he is compared
to senseless beasts and is become like to them
this way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them and afterwards
they shall delight in their mouth
which they walk they shall applaud themselves with their mouths and
glory in their doings
they are laid in hell like sheep death shall feed upon them and
the just shall have dominion over them in the morning and their help
shall decay in hell from their glory
just shall judge and condemn the wicked ibid from their glory that
is when their shortlived glory in this world shall be past and be no
more
but god will redeem my soul from the hand of hell when he shall
receive me
be not thou afraid when a man shall be made rick and when the
glory of his house shall be increased
for when he shall die he shall take nothing away nor shall his
glory descend with him
for in his lifetime his soul will be blessed and he will praise
thee when thou shalt do well to him
he shall go in to the generations of his fathers and he shall
never see light
man when he was in honour did not understand he hath been
compared to senseless beasts and made like to them
blood of victims
a psalm for asaph the god of gods the lord hath spoken and he
hath called the earth from the rising of the sun to the going down
thereof
out of sion the loveliness of his beauty
god shall come manifestly our god shall come and shall not keep
silence a fire shall burn before him and a mighty tempest shall be
round about him
he shall call heaven from above and the earth to judge his
people
gather ye together his saints to him who set his covenant before
sacrifices
and the heavens shall declare his justice for god is judge
hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify
to thee i am god thy god
i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices and thy burnt
offerings are always in my sight
i will not take calves out of thy house nor hegoats out of thy
flocks
for all the beasts of the woods are mine the cattle on the
hills and the oxen
i know all the fowls of the air and with me is the beauty of the
field
if i should be hungry i would not tell thee for the world is
mine and the fulness thereof
shall i eat the flesh of bullocks or shall i drink the blood of
goats
offer to god the sacrifice of praise and pay thy vows to the
most high
and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and
thou shalt glorify me
but to the sinner god hath said why dost thou declare my
justices and take my covenant in thy mouth
seeing thou hast hated discipline and hast cast my words behind
thee
if thou didst see a thief thou didst run with him and with
adulterers thou hast been a partaker
thy mouth hath abounded with evil and thy tongue framed deceits
sitting thou didst speak against thy brother and didst lay a
scandal against thy mothers son
these things hast thou done and i was silent thou thoughtest
unjustly that i should be like to thee but i will reprove thee and set
before thy face
understand these things you that forget god lest he snatch you
away and there be none to deliver you
the sacrifice of praise shall glorify me and there is the way by
which i will shew him the salvation of god
penitential psalm
unto the end a psalm of david
when nathan the prophet came to him after he had sinned with
have mercy on me o god according to thy great mercy and
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my iniquity
wash me yet more from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
for i know my iniquity and my sin is always before me
to thee only have i sinned and have done evil before thee that
thou mayst be justified in thy words and mayst overcome when thou art
judged
for behold i was conceived in iniquities and in sins did my
mother conceive me
for behold thou hast loved truth the uncertain and hidden things
of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me
thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop and i shall be cleansed thou
shalt wash me and i shall be made whiter than snow
to my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness and the bones
that have been humbled shall rejoice
turn away thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities
create a clean heart in me o god and renew a right spirit
within my bowels
cast me not away from thy face and take not thy holy spirit from
me
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and strengthen me with
a perfect spirit
i will teach the unjust thy ways and the wicked shall be
converted to thee
deliver me from blood o god thou god of my salvation and my
tongue shall extol thy justice
o lord thou wilt open my lips and my mouth shall declare thy
praise
for if thou hadst desired sacrifice i would indeed have given
it with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted
a sacrifice to god is an afflicted spirit a contrite and humbled
heart o god thou wilt not despise
deal favourably o lord in thy good will with sion that the
walls of jerusalem may be built up
then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice oblations and
whole burnt offerings then shall they lay calves upon thy altar
destruction
unto the end understanding for david
when doeg the edomite came and told saul david went to the house
of achimelech
why dost thou glory in malice thou that art mighty in iniquity
all the day long thy tongue hath devised injustice as a sharp
razor thou hast wrought deceit
thou hast loved malice more than goodness and iniquity rather
than to speak righteousness
thou hast loved all the words of ruin o deceitful tongue
therefore will god destroy thee for ever he will pluck thee out
and remove thee from thy dwelling place and thy root out of the land of
the living
the just shall see and fear and shall laugh at him and say
behold the man that made not god his helper but trusted in the
abundance of his riches and prevailed in his vanity
but i as a fruitful olive tree in the house of god have hoped
in the mercy of god for ever yea for ever and ever
i will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and i
will wait on thy name for it is good in the sight of thy saints
unto the end for maeleth understandings to david the fool said
in his heart there is no god
for st jerome renders it per chorum
they are corrupted and become abominable in iniquities there is
none that doth good
god looked down from heaven on the children of men to see if
there were any that did understand or did seek god
all have gone aside they are become unprofitable together there
is none that doth good no not one
shall not all the workers of iniquity know who eat up my people
as they eat bread
they have not called upon god there have they trembled for fear
where there was no fear for god hath scattered the bones of them that
please men they have been confounded because god hath despised them
the strength of all those that seek to please men to the prejudice of
their duty to their maker
who will give out of sion the salvation of israel when god shall
bring back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel
shall be glad
unto the end in verses understanding for david
when the en of ziph had come and said to saul is not david hidden
with us kings
save me o god by thy name and judge me in thy strength
o god hear my prayer give ear to the words of my mouth
for strangers have risen up against me and the mighty have
sought after my soul and they have not set god before their eyes
for behold god is my helper and the lord is the protector of my
soul
turn back the evils upon my enemies and cut them off in thy
truth
i will freely sacrifice to thee and will give praise o god to
thy name because it is good
for thou hast delivered me out of all trouble and my eye hath
looked down upon my enemies
unto the end in verses understanding for david
hear o god my prayer and despise not my supplication
be attentive to me and hear me i am grieved in my exercise and
am troubled
at the voice of the enemy and at the tribulation of the sinner
troublesome to me
my heart is troubled within me and the fear of death is fallen
upon me
fear and trembling are come upon me and darkness hath covered me
and i said who will give me wings like a dove and i will fly and
be at rest
lo i have gone far off flying away and i abode in the
wilderness
i waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit
and a storm
cast down o lord and divide their tongues for i have seen
iniquity and contradiction in the city
day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls and in
the midst thereof are labour
and injustice and usury and deceit have not departed from its
streets
for if my enemy had reviled me i would verily have borne with
it and if he that hated me had spoken great things against me i would
perhaps have hidden my self from him
but thou a man of one mind my guide and my familiar
who didst take sweetmeats together with me in the house of god
we walked with consent
let death come upon them and let them go down alive into hell
psalms are delivered prophetically that is by way of foretelling the
punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice and
approving the righteous ways of god but not by way of ill will or
uncharitable curses which the law of god disallows
but i have cried to god and the lord will save me
evening and morning and at noon i will speak and declare and he
shall hear my voice
he shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me
for among many they were with me
in company all combined to fight against me
god shall hear and the eternal shall humble them for there is
no change with them and they have not feared god
he hath stretched forth his hand to repay they have defiled his
covenant
they are divided by the wrath of his countenance and his heart
hath drawn near his words are smoother than oil and the same are darts
by the wrath of god who looks with indignation on their wicked and
deceitful ways
cast thy care upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall
not suffer the just to waver for ever
but thou o god shalt bring them down into the pit of
destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days but i will trust in thee o lord
unto the end for a people that is removed at a distance form the
sanctuary for david for an inscription of a title or pillar when the
have mercy on me o god for man hath trodden me under foot all
the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me
my enemies have trodden on me all the day long for they are many
that make war against me
from the height of the day i shall fear but i will trust in thee
highest i am still in danger
in god i will praise my words in god i have put my trust i will
not fear what flesh can do against me
all the day long they detested my words all their thoughts were
against me unto evil
they will dwell and hide themselves they will watch my heel as
they have waited for my soul
for nothing shalt thou save them in thy anger thou shalt break
the people in pieces o god
ruin my soul thou shalt for no consideration favour or assist them but
execute thy justice upon them
i have declared to thee my life thou hast set me tears in thy
sight as also in thy promise
then shall my enemies be turned back in what day soever i shall
call upon thee behold i know thou art my god
in god will i praise the word in the lord will i praise his
speech in god have i hoped i will not fear what man can do to me
in me o god are vows to thee which i will pay praises to
thee
because thou hast delivered my soul from death my feet from
falling that i may please in the sight of god in the light of the
living
for his delivery
unto the end destroy not for david for an inscription of a
title when he fled from saul into the cave kings
have mercy on me o god have mercy on me for my soul trusteth in
thee and in the shadow of thy wings will i hope until iniquity pass
away
i will cry to god the most high to god who hath done good to me
he hath sent from heaven and delivered me he hath made them a
reproach that trod upon me god hath sent his mercy and his truth
and he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions i
slept troubled the sons of men whose teeth are weapons and arrows and
their tongue a sharp sword
be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory above all
the earth
they prepared a snare for my feet and they bowed down my soul
my heart is ready o god my heart is ready i will sing and
rehearse a psalm
arise o my glory arise psaltery and harp i will arise early
i will give praise to thee o lord among the people i will sing
a psalm to thee among the nations
for thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens and thy truth
unto the clouds
be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory above
all the earth
unto the end destroy not for david for an inscription of a
title
if in very deed ye speak justice judge right things ye sons of
men
for in your heart you work iniquity your hands forge injustice in
the earth
the wicked are alienated from the womb they have gone astray from
the womb they have spoken false things
their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent like the
deaf asp that stoppeth her ears
which will not hear the voice of the charmers nor of the wizard
that charmeth wisely
god shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth the lord
shall break the grinders of the lions
they shall come to nothing like water running down he hath bent
his bow till they be weakened
like wax that melteth they shall be taken away fire hath fallen
on them and they shall not see the sun
before your thorns could know the brier he swalloweth them up
as alive in his wrath
become strong briers they shall be overtaken and consumed by divine
justice swallowing them up as it were alive in his wrath
the just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge he shall
wash his hands in the blood of the sinner
occasion from the consideration of the punishment of the wicked to wash
and cleanse his hands from sin
and man shall say if indeed there be fruit to the just there is
indeed a god that judgeth them on the earth
and protection it agrees to christ and his enemies the jews
unto the end destroy not for david for an inscription of a
title when saul sent and watched his house to kill him kings
deliver me from my enemies o my god and defend me from them that
rise up against me
deliver me from them that work iniquity and save me from bloody
men
for behold they have caught my soul the mighty have rushed in
upon me
neither is it my iniquity nor my sin o lord without iniquity
have i run and directed my steps
rise up thou to meet me and behold even thou o lord the god of
hosts the god of israel attend to visit all the nations have no mercy
on all them that work iniquity
they shall return at evening and shall suffer hunger like dogs
and shall go round about the city
behold they shall speak with their mouth and a sword is in their
lips for who say they hath heard us
but thou o lord shalt laugh at them thou shalt bring all the
nations to nothing
i will keep my strength to thee for thou art my protector
my god his mercy shall prevent me
god shall let me see over my enemies slay them not lest at any
time my people forget scatter them by thy power and bring them down o
for the sin of their mouth and the word of their lips and let
them be taken in their pride and for their cursing and lying they shall
be talked of
when they are consumed when they are consumed by thy wrath and
they shall be no more and they shall know that god will rule jacob and
all the ends of the earth
they shall return at evening and shall suffer hunger like dogs
and shall go round about the city
they shall be scattered abroad to eat and shall murmur if they
be not filled
but i will sing thy strength and will extol thy mercy in the
morning for thou art become my support and my refuge in the day of my
trouble
unto thee o my helper will i sing for thou art god my defence
my god my mercy
unto the end for them that shall be changed for the inscription
of a title to david himself for doctrine
when he set fire to mesopotamia of syria and sobal and joab
returned and slew of edom in the vale of the saltpits twelve thousand
men
o god thou hast cast us off and hast destroyed us thou hast
been angry and hast had mercy on us
thou hast moved the earth and hast troubled it heal thou the
breaches thereof for it has been moved
thou hast shewn thy people hard things thou hast made us drink
the wine of sorrow
thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee that they may
flee from before the bow that thy beloved may be delivered
save me with thy right hand and hear me
god hath spoken in his holy place i will rejoice and i will
divide sichem and will mete out the vale of tabernacles
galaad is mine and manasses is mine and ephraim is the strength
of my head juda is my king
moab is the pot of my hope into edom will i stretch out my shoe
to me the foreigners are made subject
uses by being reduced to serve me even in the meanest employments
with the israelites whereas the edomites moabites etc were
originally of the same family
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into
wilt not thou o god who hast cast us off and wilt not thou o

their sins and in restoring to his grace those whose behaviour had been
most provoking and who by their evil habits were not only dead but

standing i am come into the depth of the sea and a tempest hath
overwhelmed me
i have laboured with crying my jaws are become hoarse my eyes
have failed whilst i hope in my god
they are multiplied above the hairs of my head who hate me
without cause my enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully
persecuted me then did i pay that which i took not away
restitution of what he had not taken away by suffering the punishment
due to our sins and so repairing the injury we had done to god
o god thou knowest my foolishness and my offences are not hidden
from thee
follies and sins of men which i have taken upon myself
let not them be ashamed for me who look for thee o lord the
because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my
face
i am become a stranger to my brethren and an alien to the sons of
my mother
for the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of
them that reproached thee are fallen upon me
and i covered my soul in fasting and it was made a reproach to
me
and i made haircloth my garment and i became a byword to them
they that sat in the gate spoke against me and they that drank
wine made me their song
but as for me my prayer is to thee o lord for the time of thy
good pleasure o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the
truth of thy salvation
draw me out of the mire that i may not stick fast deliver me
from them that hate me and out of the deep waters
let not the tempest of water drown me nor the deep water swallow
me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me
hear me o lord for thy mercy is kind look upon me according to
the multitude of thy tender mercies
and turn not away thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble
hear me speedily
attend to my soul and deliver it save me because of my enemies
thou knowest my reproach and my confusion and my shame
in thy sight are all they that afflict me my heart hath expected
reproach and misery and i looked for one that would grieve together
with me but there was none and for one that would comfort me and i
found none
and they gave me gall for my food and in my thirst they gave me
vinegar to drink
let their table become as a snare before them and a recompense
and a stumblingblock
imprecation is a prophecy of the wretched state to which the jews
should be reduced in punishment of their wilful obstinacy
let their eyes be darkened that they see not and their back bend
thou down always
pour out thy indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger
take hold of them
let their habitation be made desolate and let there be none to
dwell in their tabernacles
because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten and they
have added to the grief of my wounds
add thou iniquity upon their iniquity and let them not come into
thy justice
let them be blotted out of the book of the living and with the
just let them not be written
but i am poor and sorrowful thy salvation o god hath set me
up
i will praise the name of god with a canticle and i will magnify
him with praise
and it shall please god better than a young calf that bringeth
forth horns and hoofs

live

prisoners

let them be turned backward and blush for shame that desire evils
to me let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to
me tis well tis well
t is well t is well euge euge st jerome renders it vah vah
which is the voice of one insulting and deriding some understand it as
a detestation of deceitful flatterers
let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such
as love thy salvation say always the lord be magnified
but i am needy and poor o god help me thou art my helper and my
deliverer o lord make no delay
a psalm for david of the sons of jonadab and the former
captives in thee o lord i have hoped let me never be put to
confusion
addition of the seventytwo interpreters we gather that this psalm was
usually sung in the synagogue in the person of the rechabites and of
those who were first carried away into captivity
deliver me in thy justice and rescue me incline thy ear unto me
and save me
be thou unto me a god a protector and a place of strength that
thou mayst make me safe for thou art my firmament and my refuge
deliver me o my god out of the hand of the sinner and out of
the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust
for thou art my patience o lord my hope o lord from my youth
by thee have i been confirmed from the womb from my mothers womb
thou art my protector of thee i shall continually sing
i am become unto many as a wonder but thou art a strong helper
let my mouth be filled with praise that i may sing thy glory thy
greatness all the day long
cast me not off in the time of old age when my strength shall
fail do not thou forsake me
for my enemies have spoken against me and they that watched my
soul have consulted together
saying god hath forsaken him pursue and take him for there is
none to deliver him
o god be not thou far from me o my god make haste to my help
let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul
let them be covered with confusion and blame that seek my hurt
but i will always hope and will add to all thy praise
my mouth shall shew forth thy justice thy salvation all the day
long because i have not known learning
on the power and justice of god
i will enter into the powers of the lord o lord i will be
mindful of thy justice alone
thou hast taught me o god from my youth and till now i will
declare thy wonderful works
and unto old age and grey hairs o god forsake me not until i
shew forth thy arm to all the generation that is to come thy power
and thy justice o god even to the highest great things thou
hast done o god who is like to thee
how great troubles hast thou shewn me many and grievous and
turning thou hast brought me to life and hast brought me back again
from the depths of the earth
thou hast multiplied thy magnificence and turning to me thou
hast comforted me
for i will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of
psaltery o god i will sing to thee with the harp thou holy one of
my lips shall greatly rejoice when i shall sing to thee and my
soul which thou hast redeemed
yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day when
they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me
a psalm on solomon
give to the king thy judgment o god and to the kings son thy
justice to judge thy people with justice and thy poor with judgment
let the mountains receive peace for the people and the hills
justice
he shall judge the poor of the people and he shall save the
children of the poor and he shall humble the oppressor
and he shall continue with the sun and before the moon throughout
all generations
he shall come down like rain upon the fleece and as showers
falling gently upon the earth
in his days shall justice spring up and abundance of peace till
the moon be taken away
and he shall rule from sea to sea and from the river unto the
ends of the earth
before him the ethiopians shall fall down and his enemies shall
lick the ground
the kings of tharsis and the islands shall offer presents the
kings of the arabians and of saba shall bring gifts
and all kings of the earth shall adore him all nations shall
serve him
for he shall deliver the poor from the mighty and the needy that
had no helper
he shall spare the poor and needy and he shall save the souls of
the poor
he shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity and their
names shall be honourable in his sight
and he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of
day
and there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of
mountains above libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted and they of
the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth
congregation
let his name be blessed for evermore his name continueth before
the sun and in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed all
nations shall magnify him

things
and blessed be the name of his majesty for ever and the whole
earth shall be filled with his majesty so be it so be it
the praises of david the son of jesse are ended
in order of time the last of those which david composed
overcome by the consideration of the justice of god who will quickly
render to every one according to his works
a psalm for asaph how good is god to israel to them that are of
a right heart
but my feet were almost moved my steps had well nigh slipped
because i had a zeal on occasion of the wicked seeing the
prosperity of sinners
for there is no regard to their death nor is there strength in
their stripes
they are not in the labour of men neither shall they be scourged
like other men
therefore pride hath held them fast they are covered with their
iniquity and their wickedness
their iniquity hath come forth as it were from fatness they have
passed into the affection of the heart
in their iniquity and made them give themselves up to their irregular
affections
they have thought and spoken wickedness they have spoken iniquity
on high
they have set their mouth against heaven and their tongue hath
passed through the earth
therefore will my people return here and full days shall be found
in them
apt often to return to this thought and will be shocked when they
consider the full days that is the long and prosperous life of the
wicked and will be tempted to make the reflections against providence
which are set down in the following verses
and they said how doth god know and is there knowledge in the
most high
behold these are sinners and yet abounding in the world they
have obtained riches
and i said then have i in vain justified my heart and washed my
hands among the innocent
and i have been scourged all the day and my chastisement hath
been in the mornings
if i said i will speak thus behold i should condemn the
generation of thy children
i studied that i might know this thing it is a labour in my
sight
until i go into the sanctuary of god and understand concerning
their last ends
but indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them when they were
lifted up thou hast cast them down
deceiving them thou hast brought evils upon them in their last end
which in their prosperity they never apprehended
how are they brought to desolation they have suddenly ceased to
be they have perished by reason of their iniquity
as the dream of them that awake o lord so in thy city thou
shalt bring their image to nothing
for my heart hath been inflamed and my reins have been changed
and i am brought to nothing and i knew not
i am become as a beast before thee and i am always with thee
thou hast held me by my right hand and by thy will thou hast
conducted me and with thy glory thou hast received me
for what have i in heaven and besides thee what do i desire upon
earth
for thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away thou art the
for behold they that go far from thee shall perish thou hast
destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee
but it is good for me to adhere to my god to put my hope in the
daughter of sion
understanding for asaph o god why hast thou cast us off unto the
end why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture
remember thy congregation which thou hast possessed from the
beginning the sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed
mount sion in which thou hast dwelt
lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end see what
things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary
and they that hate thee have made their boasts in the midst of
thy solemnity they have set up their ensigns for signs
trophies both on the gates and on the highest top of the temple and
they knew not that is they regarded not the sanctity of the place
profanation of the temple by antiochus
and they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top as
with axes in a wood of trees
they have cut down at once the gates thereof with axe and hatchet
they have brought it down
they have set fire to thy sanctuary they have defiled the
dwelling place of thy name on the earth
they said in their heart the whole kindred of them together let
us abolish all the festival days of god from the land
our signs we have not seen there is now no prophet and he will
know us no more
how long o god shall the enemy reproach is the adversary to
provoke thy name for ever
why dost thou turn away thy hand and thy right hand out of the
midst of thy bosom for ever
but god is our king before ages he hath wrought salvation in the
midst of the earth
thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm thou didst crush
the heads of the dragons in the waters
walls whilst israel passed through and destroying the egyptians called
here dragons from their cruelty in the same waters with their king
casting up their bodies on the shore to be stripped by the ethiopians
inhabiting in those days the coast of arabia
thou hast broken the heads of the dragon thou hast given him to
be meat for the people of the ethiopians
thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents thou hast
dried up the ethan rivers
verified in jordan jos and in arnon num
thine is the day and thine is the night thou hast made the
morning light and the sun
thou hast made all the borders of the earth the summer and the
spring were formed by thee
remember this the enemy hath reproached the lord and a foolish
people hath provoked thy name
deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee and
forget not to the end the souls of thy poor
have regard to thy covenant for they that are the obscure of the
earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity
that is enriched with houses of iniquity that is with our estates
and possessions which they have unjustly acquired
let not the humble be turned away with confusion the poor and
needy shall praise thy name
arise o god judge thy own cause remember thy reproaches with
which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day
forget not the voices of thy enemies the pride of them that hate
thee ascendeth continually
unto the end corrupt not a psalm of a canticle for asaph
hymn to the tune of which this psalm was to be sung st augustine and
other fathers take it to be an admonition of the spirit of god not to
faint or fail in our hope but to persevere with constancy in good
because god will not fail in his due time to render to every man
according to his works
we will praise thee o god we will praise and we will call upon
thy name we will relate thy wondrous works
when i shall take a time i will judge justices
day when the earth shall melt away at the presence of the great judge
the same who originally laid the foundations of it and as it were
established its pillars
the earth is melted and all that dwell therein i have
established the pillars thereof
i said to the wicked do not act wickedly and to the sinners
lift not up your horn on high speak not iniquity against god
for neither from the east nor from the west nor from the desert
hills
for god is the judge one he putteth down and another he lifteth
up
for in the hand of the lord there is a cup of strong wine full of
mixture and he hath poured it out from this to that but the dregs
thereof are not emptied all the sinners of the earth shall drink
but i will declare for ever i will sing to the god of jacob
and i will break all the horns of sinners but the horns of the
just shall be exalted
alludes to the slaughter of the assyrians in the days of king ezechias
unto the end in praises a psalm for asaph a canticle to the
in judea god is known his name is great in israel
and his place is in peace and his abode in sion
there hath he broken the powers of bows the shield the sword
and the battle
thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills
all the foolish of heart were troubled they have slept their
sleep and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands
at thy rebuke o god of jacob they have all slumbered that
mounted on horseback
thou art terrible and who shall resist thee from that time thy
wrath
thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven the earth
trembled and was still
when god arose in judgment to save all the meek of the earth
for the thought of man shall give praise to thee and the
remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee
vow ye and pay to the lord your god all you that are round
about him bring presents to him that is terrible
even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes to the
terrible with the kings of the earth
his mercy and power
unto the end for idithun a psalm of asaph
i cried to the lord with my voice to god with my voice and he
gave ear to me
in the days of my trouble i sought god with my hands lifted up to
him in the night and i was not deceived my soul refused to be
comforted
i remembered god and was delighted and was exercised and my
spirit swooned away
my eyes prevented the watches i was troubled and i spoke not
i thought upon the days of old and i had in my mind the eternal
years
and i meditated in the night with my own heart and i was
exercised and i swept my spirit
will god then cast off for ever or will he never be more
favourable again
or will he cut off his mercy for ever from generation to
generation
or will god forget to shew mercy or will he in his anger shut up
his mercies
and i said now have i begun this is the change of the right
hand of the most high
i remembered the works of the lord for i will be mindful of thy
wonders from the beginning
and i will meditate on all thy works and will be employed in thy
inventions
thy way o god is in the holy place who is the great god like
our god
thou art the god that dost wonders thou hast made thy power
known among the nations
with thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of jacob
and of joseph
the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee and they were
afraid and the depths were troubled
great was the noise of the waters the clouds sent out a sound
the voice of thy thunder in a wheel thy lightnings enlightened
the world the earth shook and trembled
thy way is in the sea and thy paths in many waters and thy
footsteps shall not be known
thou hast conducted thy people like sheep by the hand of moses
and aaron
ingratitude
understanding for asaph attend o my people to my law incline
your ears to the words of my mouth
i will open my mouth in parables i will utter propositions from
the beginning
historical facts of ancient times commemorated in this psalm were deep
and mysterious as being figures of great truths appertaining to the
time of the new testament
how great things have we heard and known and our fathers have
told us
they have not been hidden from their children in another
generation declaring the praises of the lord and his powers and his
wonders which he hath done
and he set up a testimony in jacob and made a law in israel how
great things he commanded our fathers that they should make the same
known to their children
that another generation might know them the children that should
be born and should rise up and declare them to their children
that they may put their hope in god and may not forget the works
of god and may seek his commandments
that they may not become like their fathers a perverse and
exasperating generation a generation that set not their heart aright
and whose spirit was not faithful to god
the sons of ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow they have
turned back in the day of battle
they kept not the covenant of god and in his law they would not
walk
and they forgot his benefits and his wonders that he had shewn
them
wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers in the
land of egypt in the field of tanis
he divided the sea and brought them through and he made the
waters to stand as in a vessel
and he conducted them with a cloud by day and all the night with
a light of fire
he struck the rock in the wilderness and gave them to drink as
out of the great deep
he brought forth water out of the rock and made streams run down
as rivers
and they added yet more sin against him they provoked the most
and they tempted god in their hearts by asking meat for their
desires
and they spoke ill of god they said can god furnish a table in
the wilderness
because he struck the rock and the waters gushed out and the
streams overflowed can he also give bread or provide a table for his
people
therefore the lord heard and was angry and a fire was kindled
against jacob and wrath came up against israel
because they believed not in god and trusted not in his
salvation
and he had commanded the clouds from above and had opened the
doors of heaven
and had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given them
the bread of heaven
man ate the bread of angels he sent them provisions in
abundance
he removed the south wind from heaven and by his power brought
in the southwest wind
and he rained upon them flesh as dust and feathered fowls like
as the sand of the sea
and they fell in the midst of their camp round about their
pavilions
so they did eat and were filled exceedingly and he gave them
their desire
they were not defrauded of that which they craved as yet their
meat was in their mouth
and the wrath of god came upon them and he slew the fat ones
amongst them and brought down the chosen men of israel
in all these things they sinned still and they behaved not for
his wondrous works
and their days were consumed in vanity and their years in haste
when he slew them then they sought him and they returned and
came to him early in the morning
and they remembered that god was their helper and the most high
and they loved him with their mouth and with their tongue they
lied unto him
but their heart was not right with him nor were they counted
faithful in his covenant
but he is merciful and will forgive their sins and will not
destroy them and many a time did he turn away his anger and did not
kindle all his wrath
and he remembered that they are flesh a wind that goeth and
returneth not
how often did they provoke him in the desert and move him to
wrath in the place without water
and they turned back and tempted god and grieved the holy one of
they remembered not his hand in the day that he redeemed them
from the hand of him that afflicted them
how he wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field
of tanis
and he turned their rivers into blood and their showers that
they might not drink
he sent amongst them divers sorts of flies which devoured them
and frogs which destroyed them
and he gave up their fruits to the blast and their labours to
the locust
and he destroyed their vineyards with hail and their mulberry
trees with hoarfrost
and he gave up their cattle to the hail and their stock to the
fire
and he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation indignation
and wrath and trouble which he sent by evil angels
he made a way for a path to his anger he spared not their souls
from death and their cattle he shut up in death
and he killed all the firstborn in the land of egypt the
firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of cham
and he took away his own people as sheep and guided them in the
wilderness like a flock
and he brought them out in hope and they feared not and the sea
overwhelmed their enemies
and he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary the
mountain which his right hand had purchased and he cast out the
distribution
and he made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tabernacles
yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and they kept
not his testimonies
and they turned away and kept not the covenant even like their
fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow
they provoked him to anger on their hills and moved him to
jealousy with their graven things
god heard and despised them and he reduced israel exceedingly
as it were to nothing
and he put away the tabernacle of silo his tabernacle where he
dwelt among men
and he delivered their strength into captivity and their beauty
into the hands of the enemy
and he shut up his people under the sword and he despised his
inheritance
fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not
lamented
their priests fell by the sword and their widows did not mourn
and the lord was awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty
man that hath been surfeited with wine
and he smote his enemies on the hinder parts he put them to an
everlasting reproach
and he rejected the tabernacle of joseph and chose not the tribe
of ephraim
but he chose the tribe of juda mount sion which he loved
and he built his sanctuary as of unicorns in the land which he
founded for ever
foreshewing the firm establishment of the one true and everlasting
sanctuary of god in his church
and he chose his servant david and took him from the flocks of
sheep he brought him from following the ewes great with young
to feed jacob his servant and israel his inheritance
and he fed them in the innocence of his heart and conducted them
by the skilfulness of his hands
to the time of the machabees
a psalm for asaph o god the heathens are come into thy
inheritance they have defiled thy holy temple they have made jerusalem
as a place to keep fruit
they have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the
fowls of the air the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth
they have poured out their blood as water round about jerusalem
and there was none to bury them
we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision
to them that are round about us
how long o lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy zeal be
kindled like a fire
pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee and
upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name
because they have devoured jacob and have laid waste his place
remember not our former iniquities let thy mercies speedily
prevent us for we are become exceeding poor
help us o god our saviour and for the glory of thy name o
lest they should say among the gentiles where is their god and
let him be made known among the nations before our eyes by the
revenging the blood of thy servants which hath been shed
let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee according
to the greatness of thy arm take possession of the children of them
that have been put to death
and render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom the
reproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord
but we thy people and the sheep of thy pasture will give thanks
to thee for ever we will shew forth thy praise unto generation and
generation
favours
unto the end for them that shall be changed a testimony for
give ear o thou that rulest israel thou that leadest joseph like
a sheep thou that sittest upon the cherubims shine forth
before ephraim benjamin and manasses stir up thy might and
come to save us
convert us o god and shew us thy face and we shall be saved
o lord god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the
prayer of thy servant
how long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears and give us
for our drink tears in measure
thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours and our
enemies have scoffed at us
o god of hosts convert us and shew thy face and we shall be
saved
thou hast brought a vineyard out of egypt thou hast cast out the
thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight thou plantedst
the roots thereof and it filled the land
the shadow of it covered the hills and the branches thereof the
cedars of god
it stretched forth its branches unto the sea and its boughs unto
the river
why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof so that all they who
pass by the way do pluck it
the boar out of the wood hath laid it waste and a singular wild
beast hath devoured it
turn again o god of hosts look down from heaven and see and
visit this vineyard
and perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted and upon
the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself
things set on fire and dug down shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance
already must perish if thou continue thy rebukes
let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand and upon the son
of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself
and we depart not from thee thou shalt quicken us and we will
call upon thy name
o lord god of hosts convert us and shew thy face and we shall
be saved

tabernacles after the gathering in of the vintage

land of egypt he heard a tongue which he knew not
he removed his back from the burdens his hands had served in
baskets
thou calledst upon me in affliction and i delivered thee i heard
thee in the secret place of tempest i proved thee at the waters of
contradiction
to hide thyself from the tempest or when i came down to mount sina
hidden from thy eyes in a storm of thunder
hear o my people and i will testify to thee o israel if thou
wilt hearken to me
there shall be no new god in thee neither shalt thou adore a
strange god
for i am the lord thy god who brought thee out of the land of
but my people heard not my voice and israel hearkened not to me
so i let them go according to the desires of their heart they
shall walk in their own inventions
if my people had heard me if israel had walked in my ways
i should soon have humbled their enemies and laid my hand on
them that troubled them
the enemies of the lord have lied to him and their time shall be
for ever

have lifted up the head
they have taken a malicious counsel against thy people and have
consulted against thy saints
they have said come and let us destroy them so that they be not
a nation and let the name of israel be remembered no more
for they have contrived with one consent they have made a
covenant together against thee

who have said let us possess the sanctuary of god for an
inheritance

situated on a hill so the good christian ascends towards the eternal
temple by certain steps of virtue disposed or ordered within the heart

place which man hath set that is which he hath brought himself to
being cast out of paradise for his sin

glory
he will not deprive of good things them that walk in innocence o

renown born in her but also to glory in great multitudes of people and
princes of her communion who have been foretold in the writings of the
prophets and registered in the writings of the apostles

a canticle of a psalm for the sons of core unto the end for
anotheribid understanding or a psalm of instruction composed by
o lord the god of my salvation i have cried in the day and in
the night before thee
let my prayer come in before thee incline thy ear to my petition
for my soul is filled with evils and my life hath drawn nigh to
hell
i am counted among them that go down to the pit i am become as a
man without help
free among the dead like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres
whom thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand
they have laid me in the lower pit in the dark places and in the
shadow of death
thy wrath is strong over me and all thy waves thou hast brought
in upon me
thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me they have set me
an abomination to themselves i was delivered up and came not forth
my eyes languished through poverty all the day i cried to thee
wilt thou shew wonders to the dead or shall physicians raise to
life and give praise to thee
shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy and thy truth
in destruction
shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy justice in the
land of forgetfulness
but i o lord have cried to thee and in the morning my prayer
shall prevent thee
lord why castest thou off my prayer why turnest thou away thy
face from me
i am poor and in labours from my youth and being exalted have
been humbled and troubled
thy wrath hath come upon me and thy terrors have troubled me
they have come round about me like water all the day they have
compassed me about together

acquaintance because of misery
grievous afflictions
of understanding for ethan the ezrahite
the mercies of the lord i will sing for ever i will shew forth
thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation

heavens thy truth shall be prepared in them

servant
thy seed will i settle for ever and i will build up thy throne
unto generation and generation

terrible above all them that are about him
o lord god of hosts who is like to thee thou art mighty o lord
and thy truth is round about thee
thou rulest the power of the sea and appeasest the motion of the
waves thereof
thou hast humbled the proud one as one that is slain with the
arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies
thine are the heavens and thine is the earth the world and the
fulness thereof thou hast founded
the north and the sea thou hast created thabor and hermon shall
rejoice in thy name
thy arm is with might let thy hand be strengthened and thy
right hand exalted
justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne mercy and
truth shall go before thy face
blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation they shall walk o
and in thy name they shall rejoice all the day and in thy
justice they shall be exalted
for thou art the glory of their strength and in thy good
pleasure shall our horn be exalted
for our protection is of the lord and of our king the holy one
of israel
then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints and saidst i have
laid help upon one that is mighty and have exalted one chosen out of my
people
i have found david my servant with my holy oil i have anointed
him
for my hand shall help him and my arm shall strengthen him
the enemy shall have no advantage over him nor the son of
iniquity have power to hurt him
and i will cut down his enemies before his face and them that
hate him i will put to flight
and my truth and my mercy shall be with him and in my name shall
his horn be exalted
and i will set his hand in the sea and his right hand in the
rivers
he shall cry out to me thou art my father my god and the
support of my salvation
and i will make him my firstborn high above the kings of the
earth
i will keep my mercy for him for ever and my covenant faithful
to him
and i will make his seed to endure for evermore and his throne
as the days of heaven
and if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments
if they profane my justices and keep not my commandments
i will visit their iniquities with a rod and their sins with
stripes
but my mercy i will not take away from him nor will i suffer my
truth to fail
neither will i profane my covenant and the words that proceed
from my mouth i will not make void
once have i sworn by my holiness i will not lie unto david
his seed shall endure for ever
and his throne as the sun before me and as the moon perfect for
ever and a faithful witness in heaven
but thou hast rejected and despised thou hast been angry with my
anointed
thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant thou hast
profaned his sanctuary on the earth
the captivity of babylon in which for the sins of the people and their
princes god seemed to have set aside for a while the covenant he made
with david
thou hast broken down all his hedges thou hast made his strength
fear
all that pass by the way have robbed him he is become a reproach
to his neighbours
thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him thou
hast made all his enemies to rejoice
thou hast turned away the help of his sword and hast not
assisted him in battle
thou hast made his purification to cease and thou hast cast his
throne down to the ground
thou hast shortened the days of his time thou hast covered him
with confusion
how long o lord turnest thou away unto the end shall thy anger
burn like fire
remember what my substance is for hast thou made all the
children of men in vain
who is the man that shall live and not see death that shall
deliver his soul from the hand of hell
lord where are thy ancient mercies according to what thou didst
swear to david in thy truth
be mindful o lord of the reproach of thy servants which i have
held in my bosom of many nations
wherewith thy enemies have reproached o lord wherewith they
have reproached the change of thy anointed
blessed be the lord for evermore so be it so be it
the days of man
a prayer of moses the man of god lord thou hast been our refuge
from generation to generation
before the mountains were made or the earth and the world was
formed from eternity and to eternity thou art god
turn not man away to be brought low and thou hast said be
converted o ye sons of men
since thou art pleased to call upon him to be converted to thee
for a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday which is past
things that are counted nothing shall their years be
in the morning man shall grow up like grass in the morning he
shall flourish and pass away in the evening he shall fall grow dry
and wither
for in thy wrath we have fainted away and are troubled in thy
indignation
thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes our life in the
light of thy countenance
for all our days are spent and in thy wrath we have fainted away
withal whilst like a spider we spend our bowels in weaving webs to
catch flies
the days of our years in them are threescore and ten years but
if in the strong they be fourscore years and what is more of them is
labour and sorrow for mildness is come upon us and we shall be

he deals kindly with us in shortening the days of this miserable life
and so weaning our affections from all its transitory enjoyments and
teaching us true wisdom
who knoweth the power of thy anger and for thy fear
can number thy wrath so make thy right hand known and men
learned in heart in wisdom
return o lord how long and be entreated in favour of thy
servants
we are filled in the morning with thy mercy and we have
rejoiced and are delighted all our days
we have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us for
the years in which we have seen evils
look upon thy servants and upon their works and direct their
children
and let the brightness of the lord our god be upon us and direct
thou the works of our hands over us yea the work of our hands do thou
direct
the praise of a canticle for david he that dwelleth in the aid of
the most high shall abide under the protection of the god of jacob
he shall say to the lord thou art my protector and my refuge my
for he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunters and from
the sharp word
he will overshadow thee with his shoulders and under his wings
thou shalt trust
his truth shall compass thee with a shield thou shalt not be
afraid of the terror of the night
of the arrow that flieth in the day of the business that walketh
about in the dark of invasion or of the noonday devil
a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right
hand but it shall not come nigh thee
but thou shalt consider with thy eyes and shalt see the reward of
the wicked
because thou o lord art my hope thou hast made the most high
thy refuge
there shall no evil come to thee nor shall the scourge come near
thy dwelling
for he hath given his angels charge over thee to keep thee in
all thy ways
in their hands they shall bear thee up lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone
thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk and thou shalt
trample under foot the lion and the dragon
because he hoped in me i will deliver him i will protect him
because he hath known my name
he shall cry to me and i will hear him i am with him in
tribulation i will deliver him and i will glorify him
i will fill him with length of days and i will shew him my
salvation
a psalm of a canticle on the sabbath day
it is good to give praise to the lord and to sing to thy name o
most high
to shew forth thy mercy in the morning and thy truth in the
night
upon an instrument of ten strings upon the psaltery with
a canticle upon the harp
for thou hast given me o lord a delight in thy doings and in
the works of thy hands i shall rejoice
o lord how great are thy works thy thoughts are exceeding deep
the senseless man shall not know nor will the fool understand
these things
when the wicked shall spring up as grass and all the workers of
iniquity shall appear that they may perish for ever and ever
but thou o lord art most high for evermore
for behold thy enemies o lord for behold thy enemies shall
perish and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered
but my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn and my old
age in plentiful mercy
my eye also hath looked down upon my enemies and my ear shall
hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me
the just shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow up like
the cedar of libanus
they that are planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in
the courts of the house of our god
they shall still increase in a fruitful old age and shall be
well treated
that they may shew that the lord our god is righteous and there
is no iniquity in him
the sabbath when the earth was founded
the lord hath reigned he is clothed with beauty the lord is
clothed with strength and hath girded himself for he hath established
the world which shall not be moved
my throne is prepared from of old thou art from everlasting
the floods have lifted up o lord the floods have lifted up their
voice the floods have lifted up their waves
with the noise of many waters wonderful are the surges of the
sea wonderful is the lord on high
thy testimonies are become exceedingly credible holiness becometh
thy house o lord unto length of days
the lord is the god to whom revenge belongeth the god of revenge
hath acted freely
lift up thyself thou that judgest the earth render a reward to
the proud
how long shall sinners o lord how long shall sinners glory
shall they utter and speak iniquity shall all speak who work
injustice
thy people o lord they have brought low and they have afflicted
thy inheritance
they have slain the widow and the stranger and they have murdered
the fatherless
and they have said the lord shall not see neither shall the god
of jacob understand
understand ye senseless among the people and you fools be wise
at last
he that planted the ear shall he not hear or he that formed the
eye doth he not consider
he that chastiseth nations shall he not rebuke he that teacheth
man knowledge
the lord knoweth the thoughts of men that they are vain
blessed is the man whom thou shalt instruct o lord and shalt
teach him out of thy law
that thou mayst give him rest from the evil days till a pit be
dug for the wicked
which he is exposed during the short and evil days of his mortality
for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he
forsake his own inheritance
until justice be turned into judgment and they that are near it
are all the upright in heart
which will be agreeable to all the upright in heart
who shall rise up for me against the evildoers or who shall
stand with me against the workers of iniquity
unless the lord had been my helper my soul had almost dwelt in
hell
if i said my foot is moved thy mercy o lord assisted me
according to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart thy
comforts have given joy to my soul
doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee who framest labour in
commandment
injustice or unjust judges to have any partnership with thee thou who
framest or makest labour in commandment that is thou who obligest us
to labour with all diligence to keep thy commandments
they will hunt after the soul of the just and will condemn
innocent blood
but the lord is my refuge and my god the help of my hope
and he will render them their iniquity and in their malice he
will destroy them the lord our god will destroy them
come let us praise the lord with joy let us joyfully sing to god
our saviour
let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a
joyful noise to him with psalms
for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods
for in his hand are all the ends of the earth and the heights of
the mountains are his
for the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry
land
come let us adore and fall down and weep before the lord that
made us
for he is the lord our god and we are the people of his pasture
and the sheep of his hand
to day if you shall hear his voice harden not your hearts
as in the provocation according to the day of temptation in the
wilderness where your fathers tempted me they proved me and saw my
works
forty years long was i offended with that generation and i said
and these men have not known my ways so i swore in my wrath that
they shall not enter into my rest

exalt ye the lord our god and adore his footstool for it is
holy
propitiatory or mercy seat as on a throne between the wings of the
cherubims in the sanctuary to which the children of israel paid a
great veneration but as this psalm evidently relates to christ and the
this text of the worship paid by the church to the body and blood of
as it were the footstool of the divinity so st ambrose l de
moses and aaron among his priests and samuel among them that call
upon his name they called upon the lord and he heard them
also was a priest and indeed the chief priest inasmuch as he
consecrated aaron and offered sacrifice for him lev so that his
preeminence over aaron makes nothing for lay church headship
he spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud they kept his
testimonies and the commandment which he gave them

them and taking vengeance on all their inventions
against them as in the case of core dathan and abiron

a psalm for david himself mercy and judgment i will sing to
thee o lord i will sing
and i will understand in the unspotted way when thou shalt come
to me i walked in the innocence of my heart in the midst of my house
endeavour to know and to follow the perfect way of thy commandments
not trusting to my own strength but relying on thy coming to me by thy
grace
i will not set before my eyes any unjust thing i hated the
workers of iniquities
the perverse heart did not cleave to me and the malignant that
turned aside from me i would not know
the man that in private detracted his neighbour him did i
persecute with him that had a proud eye and an unsatiable heart i
would not eat
my eyes were upon the faithful of the earth to sit with me the
man that walked in the perfect way he served me
he that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house
he that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes
in the morning i put to death all the wicked of the land that i
might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the lord
the prayer of the poor man when he was anxious and poured out
his supplication before the lord
hear o lord my prayer and let my cry come to thee
turn not away thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble
incline thy ear to me in what day soever i shall call upon thee hear
me speedily
for my days are vanished like smoke and my bones are grown dry
like fuel for the fire
i am smitten as grass and my heart is withered because i forgot
to eat my bread
through the voice of my groaning my bone hath cleaved to my
flesh
i am become like to a pelican of the wilderness i am like a
night raven in the house
solitude and darkness
i have watched and am become as a sparrow all alone on the
housetop
all the day long my enemies reproached me and they that praised
me did swear against me
for i did eat ashes like bread and mingled my drink with
weeping
because of thy anger and indignation for having lifted me up
thou hast thrown me down
my days have declined like a shadow and i am withered like
grass
but thou o lord endurest for ever and thy memorial to all
generations
thou shalt arise and have mercy on sion for it is time to have
mercy on it for the time is come
for the stones thereof have pleased thy servants and they shall
have pity on the earth thereof
all the gentiles shall fear thy name o lord and all the kings
of the earth thy glory
for the lord hath built up sion and he shall be seen in his
glory
he hath had regard to the prayer of the humble and he hath not
despised their petition
let these things be written unto another generation and the
people that shall be created shall praise the lord
because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary from
heaven the lord hath looked upon the earth
that he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters that
he might release the children of the slain
that they may declare the name of the lord in sion and his
praise in jerusalem
when the people assemble together and kings to serve the lord
he answered him in the way of his strength declare unto me the
fewness of my days
mentioned in the foregoing verse or the penitent in whose person this
psalm is delivered answered the lord in the way of his strength that
is according to the best of his power and strength or when he was in
the flower of his age and strength inquiring after the fewness of his
days to know if he should live long enough to see the happy restoration
of sion etc
call me not away in the midst of my days thy years are unto
generation and generation
in the beginning o lord thou foundedst the earth and the
heavens are the works of thy hands
they shall perish but thou remainest and all of them shall grow
old like a garment and as a vesture thou shalt change them and they
shall be changed
but thou art always the selfsame and thy years shall not fail
the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall
be directed for ever
for david himself bless the lord o my soul and let all that is
within me bless his holy name
bless the lord o my soul and never forget all he hath done for
thee
who forgiveth all thy iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with
mercy and compassion
who satisfieth thy desire with good things thy youth shall be
renewed like the eagles
the lord doth mercies and judgment for all that suffer wrong
he hath made his ways known to moses his wills to the children
of israel
the lord is compassionate and merciful longsuffering and
plenteous in mercy
he will not always be angry nor will he threaten for ever
he hath not dealt with us according to our sins nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities
for according to the height of the heaven above the earth he
hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him
as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our
iniquities from us
as a father hath compassion on his children so hath the lord
compassion on them that fear him
for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust
mans days are as grass as the flower of the field so shall he
flourish
for the spirit shall pass in him and he shall not be and he
shall know his place no more
but the mercy of the lord is from eternity and unto eternity
upon them that fear him and his justice unto childrens children
to such as keep his covenant and are mindful of his
commandments to do them
the lord hath prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom
shall rule over all
bless the lord all ye his angels you that are mighty in
strength and execute his word hearkening to the voice of his orders
bless the lord all ye his hosts you ministers of his that do
his will
bless the lord all his works in every place of his dominion o
my soul bless thou the lord
for david himself bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou
art exceedingly great thou hast put on praise and beauty
and art clothed with light as with a garment who stretchest out
the heaven like a pavilion
who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water who makest the
clouds thy chariot who walkest upon the wings of the winds
who makest thy angels spirits and thy ministers a burning fire
who hast founded the earth upon its own bases it shall not be
moved for ever and ever
the deep like a garment is its clothing above the mountains
shall the waters stand
at thy rebuke they shall flee at the voice of thy thunder they
shall fear
the mountains ascend and the plains descend into the place which
thou hast founded for them
thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over neither
shall they return to cover the earth
thou sendest forth springs in the vales between the midst of
the hills the waters shall pass
all the beasts of the field shall drink the wild asses shall
expect in their thirst
over them the birds of the air shall dwell from the midst of
the rocks they shall give forth their voices
thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms the earth shall be
filled with the fruit of thy works
bringing forth grass for cattle and herb for the service of
men that thou mayst bring bread out of the earth
and that wine may cheer the heart of man that he may make the
face cheerful with oil and that bread may strengthen mans heart
the trees of the field shall be filled and the cedars of
there the sparrows shall make their nests the highest of them
is the house of the heron
the high hills are a refuge for the harts the rock for the
irchins
he hath made the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going
down
thou hast appointed darkness and it is night in it shall all
the beasts of the woods go about
the young lions roaring after their prey and seeking their meat
from god
the sun ariseth and they are gathered together and they shall
lie down in their dens
man shall go forth to his work and to his labour until the
evening
how great are thy works o lord thou hast made all things in
wisdom the earth is filled with thy riches
so is this great sea which stretcheth wide its arms there are
creeping things without number creatures little and great
there the ships shall go this sea dragon which thou hast formed
to play therein
all expect of thee that thou give them food in season
what thou givest to them they shall gather up when thou openest
thy hand they shall all be filled with good
but if thou turnest away thy face they shall be troubled thou
shalt take away their breath and they shall fail and shall return to
their dust
thou shalt send forth thy spirit and they shall be created and
thou shalt renew the face of the earth
may the glory of the lord endure for ever the lord shall
rejoice in his works
he looketh upon the earth and maketh it tremble he troubleth
the mountains and they smoke
i will sing to the lord as long as i live i will sing praise to
my god while i have my being
let my speech be acceptable to him but i will take delight in
the lord
let sinners be consumed out of the earth and the unjust so
that they be no more o my soul bless thou the lord
give glory to the lord and call upon his name declare his deeds
among the gentiles
sing to him yea sing praises to him relate all his wondrous
works
glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the lord
seek ye the lord and be strengthened seek his face evermore
remember his marvellous works which he hath done his wonders
and the judgments of his mouth
o ye seed of abraham his servant ye sons of jacob his chosen
he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth
he hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations
which he made to abraham and his oath to isaac
and he appointed the same to jacob for a law and to israel for
an everlasting testament
saying to thee will i give the land of chanaan the lot of your
inheritance
when they were but a small number yea very few and sojourners
therein
and they passed from nation to nation and from one kingdom to
another people
he suffered no man to hurt them and he reproved kings for their
sakes
touch ye not my anointed and do no evil to my prophets
and he called a famine upon the land and he broke in pieces all
the support of bread
he sent a man before them joseph who was sold for a slave
they humbled his feet in fetters the iron pierced his soul
until his word came the word of the lord inflamed him
the king sent and he released him the ruler of the people and
he set him at liberty
he made him master of his house and ruler of all his
possession
that he might instruct his princes as himself and teach his
ancients wisdom
and israel went into egypt and jacob was a sojourner in the
land of cham
and he increased his people exceedingly and strengthened them
over their enemies
he turned their heart to hate his people and to deal
deceitfully with his servants
sin moved the egyptians to hate and persecute his people but that the
the benefits which god bestowed upon them
he sent moses his servant aaron the man whom he had chosen
he gave them power to shew them signs and his wonders in the
land of cham
he sent darkness and made it obscure and grieved not his
words
words or he did not grieve moses and aaron the carriers of his words
or he did not grieve his words that is his sons the children of
darkness
he turned their waters into blood and destroyed their fish
their land brought forth frogs in the inner chambers of their
kings
he spoke and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in
all their coasts
he gave them hail for rain a burning fire in the land
and he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees and he
broke in pieces the trees of their coasts
he spoke and the locust came and the bruchus of which there
was no number
and they devoured all the grass in their land and consumed all
the fruit of their ground
and he slew all the firstborn in their land the firstfruits of
all their labour
and he brought them out with silver and gold and there was not
among their tribes one that was feeble
egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them lay upon
them
he spread a cloud for their protection and fire to give them
light in the night
they asked and the quail came and he filled them with the
bread of heaven
he opened the rock and waters flowed rivers ran down in the
dry land
because he remembered his holy word which he had spoken to his
servant abraham
and he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with
gladness
and he gave them the lands of the gentiles and they possessed
the labours of the people
that they might observe his justifications and seek after his
law
other places of the scripture are called justifications because the
keeping of them makes man just the protestants render it by the word
statutes in favour of their doctrine which does not allow good works
to justify
give glory to the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth
for ever
who shall declare the powers of the lord who shall set forth all
his praises
blessed are they that keep judgment and do justice at all times
remember us o lord in the favour of thy people visit us with
thy salvation
that we may see the good of thy chosen that we may rejoice in
the joy of thy nation that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance
we have sinned with our fathers we have acted unjustly we have
wrought iniquity
our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies and they provoked to wrath going up to
the sea even the red sea
and he saved them for his own names sake that he might make his
power known
and he rebuked the red sea and it was dried up and he led them
through the depths as in a wilderness
and he saved them from the hand of them that hated them and he
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
and the water covered them that afflicted them there was not
one of them left
and they believed his words and they sang his praises
they had quickly done they forgot his works and they waited
not for his counsel
and they coveted their desire in the desert and they tempted
and he gave them their request and sent fulness into their
souls
and they provoked moses in the camp aaron the holy one of the
the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the
congregation of abiron
and a fire was kindled in their congregation the flame burned
the wicked
they made also a calf in horeb and they adored the graven
thing
and they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that
eateth grass
they forgot god who saved them who had done great things in
wondrous works in the land of cham terrible things in the red
and he said that he would destroy them had not moses his chosen
stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should
destroy them
and they set at nought the desirable land they believed not his
word
and they murmured in their tents they hearkened not to the
voice of the lord
and he lifted up his hand over them to overthrow them in the
desert
and to cast down their seed among the nations and to scatter
them in the countries
they also were initiated to beelphegor and ate the sacrifices
of the dead
idol of the moabites and madianites called beelphegor or baalpeor
and they provoked him with their inventions and destruction was
multiplied among them
then phinees stood up and pacified him and the slaughter
ceased
and it was reputed to him unto justice to generation and
generation for evermore
they provoked him also at the waters of contradiction and moses
was afflicted for their sakes
because they exasperated his spirit and he distinguished with
his lips
rebellion and incredulity was guilty of distinguishing with his lips
when instead of speaking to the rock as god had commanded he said to
the people with a certain hesitation in his faith hear ye rebellious
and incredulous can we from this rock bring out water for you num

they did not destroy the nations of which the lord spoke unto
them
and they were mingled among the heathens and learned their
works
and served their idols and it became a stumblingblock to them
and they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils
and they shed innocent blood the blood of their sons and of
their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of chanaan and the
land was polluted with blood
and was defiled with their works and they went aside after
their own inventions
and the lord was exceedingly angry with his people and he
abhorred his inheritance
and he delivered them into the hands of the nations and they
that hated them had dominion over them
and their enemies afflicted them and they were humbled under
their hands
many times did he deliver them but they provoked him with their
counsel and they were brought low by their iniquities
and he saw when they were in tribulation and he heard their
prayer
and he was mindful of his covenant and repented according to
the multitude of his mercies
and he gave them unto mercies in the sight of all those that
had made them captives
save us o lord our god and gather us from among the nations
blessed be the lord the god of israel from everlasting to
everlasting and let all the people say so be it so be it
men
give glory to the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth
for ever
let them say so that have been redeemed by the lord whom he hath
redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gathered out of the countries
from the rising and from the setting of the sun from the north
and from the sea
they wandered in a wilderness in a place without water they
found not the way of a city for their habitation
they were hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them
and they cried to the lord in their tribulation and he delivered
them out of their distresses
and he led them into the right way that they might go to a city
of habitation
let the mercies of the lord give glory to him and his wonderful
works to the children of men
for he hath satisfied the empty soul and hath filled the hungry
soul with good things
such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death bound in
want and in iron
because they had exasperated the words of god and provoked the
counsel of the most high
and their heart was humbled with labours they were weakened
and there was none to help them
then they cried to the lord in their affliction and he
delivered them out of their distresses
and he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death
and broke their bonds in sunder
let the mercies of the lord give glory to him and his wonderful
works to the children of men
because he hath broken gates of brass and burst iron bars
he took them out of the way of their iniquity for they were
brought low for their injustices
their soul abhorred all manner of meat and they drew nigh even
to the gates of death
and they cried to the lord in their affliction and he delivered
them out of their distresses
he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their
destructions
let the mercies of the lord give glory to him and his wonderful
works to the children of men
and let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise and declare his
works with joy
they that go down to the sea in ships doing business in the
great waters
these have seen the works of the lord and his wonders in the
deep
he said the word and there arose a storm of wind and the waves
thereof were lifted up
they mount up to the heavens and they go down to the depths
their soul pined away with evils
they were troubled and reeled like a drunken man and all their
wisdom was swallowed up
and they cried to the lord in their affliction and he brought
them out of their distresses
and he turned the storm into a breeze and its waves were still
and they rejoiced because they were still and he brought them
to the haven which they wished for
let the mercies of the lord give glory to him and his wonderful
works to the children of men
and let them exalt him in the church of the people and praise
him in the chair of the ancients
he hath turned rivers into a wilderness and the sources of
waters into dry ground
a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that
dwell therein
he hath turned a wilderness into pools of waters and a dry land
into water springs
and hath placed there the hungry and they made a city for their
habitation
anti they sowed fields and planted vineyards and they yielded
fruit of birth
and he blessed them and they were multiplied exceedingly and
their cattle he suffered not to decrease
then they were brought to be few and they were afflicted
through the trouble of evils and sorrow
contempt was poured forth upon their princes and he caused them
to wander where there was no passing and out of the way
and he helped the poor out of poverty and made him families
like a flock of sheep
the just shall see and shall rejoice and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth
who is wise and will keep these things and will understand the
mercies of the lord
a canticle of a psalm for david himself
my heart is ready o god my heart is ready i will sing and
will give praise with my glory
arise my glory arise psaltery and harp i will arise in the
morning early
i will praise thee o lord among the people and i will sing
unto thee among the nations
for thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth even unto
the clouds
be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory over all
the earth
that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and
hear me
god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice and i will
divide sichem and i will mete out the vale of tabernacles
galaad is mine and manasses is mine and ephraim the protection
of my head juda is my king
moab the pot of my hope over edom i will stretch out my shoe
the aliens are become my friends
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into
wilt not thou o god who hast cast us off and wilt not thou
o grant us help from trouble for vain is the help of man
through god we shall do mightily and he will bring our enemies
to nothing
especially the traitor judas foretelling and approving his just
punishment for his obstinacy in sin and final impenitence
unto the end a psalm for david
o god be not thou silent in my praise for the mouth of the
wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me
they have spoken against me with deceitful tongues and they have
compassed me about with words of hatred and have fought against me
without cause
instead of making me a return of love they detracted me but i
gave myself to prayer
and they repaid me evil for good and hatred for my love
set thou the sinner over him and may the devil stand at his
right hand
sinner power over him let him enter into him and possess him the
imprecations contained in the thirty verses of this psalm are opposed
to the thirty pieces of silver for which judas betrayed our lord and
are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that should
befall the traitor and his accomplices the jews and not properly as
curses
when he is judged may he go out condemned and may his prayer be
turned to sin
may his days be few and his bishopric let another take
may his children be fatherless and his wife a widow
let his children be carried about vagabonds and beg and let
them be cast out of their dwellings
may the usurer search all his substance and let strangers
plunder his labours
may there be none to help him nor none to pity his fatherless
offspring
may his posterity be cut off in one generation may his name be
blotted out
may the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of
the lord and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out
may they be before the lord continually and let the memory of
them perish from the earth
because he remembered not to shew mercy
but persecuted the poor man and the beggar and the broken in
heart to put him to death
and he loved cursing and it shall come unto him and he would
not have blessing and it shall be far from him and he put on cursing
like a garment and it went in like water into his entrails and like
oil in his bones
may it be unto him like a garment which covereth him and like a
girdle with which he is girded continually
this is the work of them who detract me before the lord and who
speak evils against my soul
but thou o lord do with me for thy names sake because thy
mercy is sweet do thou deliver me
for i am poor and needy and my heart is troubled within me
i am taken away like the shadow when it declineth and i am
shaken off as locusts
my knees are weakened through fasting and my flesh is changed
for oil
perfectly emaciated and dried up as having lost all its oil or fatness
and i am become a reproach to them they saw me and they shaked
their heads
help me o lord my god save me according to thy mercy
and let them know that this is thy hand and that thou o lord
hast done it
they will curse and thou wilt bless let them that rise up
against me be confounded but thy servant shall rejoice
let them that detract me be clothed with shame and let them be
covered with their confusion as with a double cloak
i will give great thanks to the lord with my mouth and in the
midst of many i will praise him
because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor to save my
soul from persecutors
a psalm for david the lord said to my lord sit thou at my right
hand until i make thy enemies thy footstool
the lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of sion
rule thou in the midst of thy enemies
with thee is the principality in the day of thy strength in the
brightness of the saints from the womb before the day star i begot
thee
the lord hath sworn and he will not repent thou art a priest
for ever according to the order of melchisedech
the lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his
wrath
he shall judge among nations he shall fill ruins he shall crush
the heads in the land of many
he shall drink of the torrent in the way therefore shall he lift
up the head
i will praise thee o lord with my whole heart in the council
of the just and in the congregation
great are the works of the lord sought out according to all his
wills
his work is praise and magnificence and his justice continueth
for ever and ever
he hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works being a
merciful and gracious lord
he hath given food to them that fear him he will be mindful for
ever of his covenant

that he may give them the inheritance of the gentiles the works
of his hands are truth and judgment

covenant for ever holy and terrible is his name

understanding to all that do it his praise continueth for ever and
ever
of the return of the people from their captivity to inculcate to them
how happy they might be if they would be constant in the service of
blessed is the man that feareth the lord he shall delight
exceedingly in his commandments
his seed shall be mighty upon earth the generation of the
righteous shall be blessed
glory and wealth shall be in his house and his justice remaineth
for ever and ever

and compassionate and just

order his words with judgment
because he shall not be moved for ever
the just shall be in everlasting remembrance he shall not fear
the evil hearing his heart is ready to hope in the lord
his heart is strengthened he shall not be moved until he look
over his enemies
he hath distributed he hath given to the poor his justice
remaineth for ever and ever his horn shall be exalted in glory
the wicked shall see and shall be angry he shall gnash with
his teeth and pine away the desire of the wicked shall perish
praise the lord ye children praise ye the name of the lord
blessed be the name of the lord from henceforth now and for
ever
from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same
the name of the lord is worthy of praise
the lord is high above all nations and his glory above the
heavens
who is as the lord our god who dwelleth on high
and looketh down on the low things in heaven and in earth
raising up the needy from the earth and lifting up the poor out
of the dunghill
that he may place him with princes with the princes of his
people
who maketh a barren woman to dwell in a house the joyful mother
of children
when israel went out of egypt the house of jacob from a
barbarous people
judea was made his sanctuary israel his dominion
the sea saw and fled jordan was turned back
the mountains skipped like rams and the hills like the lambs of
the flock
what ailed thee o thou sea that thou didst flee and thou o
ye mountains that ye skipped like rams and ye hills like lambs
of the flock
at the presence of the lord the earth was moved at the presence
of the god of jacob
who turned the rock into pools of water and the stony hill into
fountains of waters
not to us o lord not to us but to thy name give glory
for thy mercy and for thy truths sake lest the gentiles should
say where is their god
but our god is in heaven he hath done all things whatsoever he
would
the idols of the gentiles are silver and gold the works of the
hands of men
they have mouths and speak not they have eyes and see not
they have ears and hear not they have noses and smell not
they have hands and feel not they have feet and walk not
neither shall they cry out through their throat
let them that make them become like unto them and all such as
trust in them
the house of israel hath hoped in the lord he is their helper
and their protector
the house of aaron hath hoped in the lord he is their helper
and their protector

helper and their protector
the lord hath been mindful of us and hath blessed us he hath
blessed the house of israel he hath blessed the house of aaron

may the lord add blessings upon you upon you and upon your
children
blessed be you of the lord who made heaven and earth
the heaven of heaven is the lords but the earth he has given
to the children of men
the dead shall not praise thee o lord nor any of them that go
down to hell
but we that live bless the lord from this time now and for
ever
i have loved because the lord will hear the voice of my prayer
because he hath inclined his ear unto me and in my days i will
call upon him

have found me i met with trouble and sorrow
and i called upon the name of the lord o lord deliver my soul

delivered me

to thee
for he hath delivered my soul from death my eyes from tears my
feet from falling
i will please the lord in the land of the living
express the faith and gratitude of the psalmist
i have believed therefore have i spoken but i have
been humbled exceedingly
i said in my excess every man is a liar
what shall i render to the lord for all the things that he hath
rendered to me
i will take the chalice of salvation and i will call upon the
name of the lord
i will pay my vows to the lord before all his people
precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints
o lord for i am thy servant i am thy servant and the son of
thy handmaid thou hast broken my bonds
i will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise and i will
call upon the name of the lord

remaineth for ever
trust in him and foretelleth the coming of christ
give praise to the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth
for ever
let israel now say that he is good that his mercy endureth for
ever
let the house of aaron now say that his mercy endureth for ever
let them that fear the lord now say that his mercy endureth for
ever
in my trouble i called upon the lord and the lord heard me and
enlarged me
the lord is my helper i will not fear what man can do unto me
the lord is my helper and i will look over my enemies
it is good to confide in the lord rather than to have confidence
in man
it is good to trust in the lord rather than to trust in princes
all nations compassed me about and in the name of the lord i
have been revenged on them
surrounding me they compassed me about and in the name of the
they surrounded me like bees and they burned like fire among
thorns and in the name of the lord i was revenged on them
being pushed i was overturned that i might fall but the lord
supported me
the lord is my strength and my praise and he is become my
salvation
the voice of rejoicing and of salvation is in the tabernacles of
the just
the right hand of the lord hath wrought strength the right hand
of the lord hath exalted me the right hand of the lord hath wrought
strength

the lord chastising hath chastised me but he hath not delivered
me over to death

give praise to the lord

i will give glory to thee because thou hast heard me and art
become my salvation

head of the corner

rejoice therein

blessed be he that cometh in the name of the lord we have
blessed you out of the house of the lord

day with shady boughs even to the horn of the altar

will exalt thee i will praise thee because thou hast heard me and art
become my salvation

ever
commandments of god
second eight verses begin with beth the name of the second letter of
the hebrew alphabet and so to the end of the whole alphabet in all
twentytwo letters each letter having eight verses this order is
variously expounded by the holy fathers which shews the difficulty of
understanding the holy scriptures and consequently with what humility
and submission to the church they are to be read
blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the
blessed are they that search his testimonies that seek him with
their whole heart
because they testify his holy will unto us note here that in almost
every verse of this psalm which in number are the word and law of
a variety of denominations all signifying the same thing
for they that work iniquity have not walked in his ways
thou hast commanded thy commandments to be kept most diligently
o that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications
then shall i not be confounded when i shall look into all thy
commandments
i will praise thee with uprightness of heart when i shall have
learned the judgments of thy justice
i will keep thy justifications o do not thou utterly forsake
me
by what doth a young man correct his way by observing thy words
with my whole heart have i sought after thee let me not stray
from thy commandments
thy words have i hidden in my heart that i may not sin against
thee
blessed art thou o lord teach me thy justifications
with my lips i have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth
i have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies as in all
riches
i will meditate on thy commandments and i will consider thy
ways
i will think of thy justifications i will not forget thy words
give bountifully to thy servant enliven me and i shall keep
thy words
open thou my eyes and i will consider the wondrous things of
thy law
i am a sojourner on the earth hide not thy commandments from
me
my soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications at all
times
thou hast rebuked the proud they are cursed who decline from
thy commandments
remove from me reproach and contempt because i have sought
after thy testimonies
for princes sat and spoke against me but thy servant was
employed in thy justifications
for thy testimonies are my meditation and thy justifications my
counsel
my soul hath cleaved to the pavement quicken thou me according
to thy word
i have declared my ways and thou hast heard me teach me thy
justifications
make me to understand the way of thy justifications and i shall
be exercised in thy wondrous works
my soul hath slumbered through heaviness strengthen thou me in
thy words
remove from me the way of iniquity and out of thy law have
mercy on me
i have chosen the way of truth thy judgments i have not
forgotten
i have stuck to thy testimonies o lord put me not to shame
i have run the way of thy commandments when thou didst enlarge
my heart
set before me for a law the way of thy justifications o lord
and i will always seek after it
give me understanding and i will search thy law and i will
keep it with my whole heart
lead me into the path of thy commandments for this same i have
desired
incline my heart into thy testimonies and not to covetousness
turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity quicken me in
thy way
establish thy word to thy servant in thy fear
turn away my reproach which i have apprehended for thy
judgments are delightful
behold i have longed after thy precepts quicken me in thy
justice
let thy mercy also come upon me o lord thy salvation
according to thy word
so shall i answer them that reproach me in any thing that i
have trusted in thy words
and take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth for
in thy words i have hoped exceedingly
so shall i always keep thy law for ever and ever
and i walked at large because i have sought after thy
commandments
and i spoke of thy testimonies before kings and i was not
ashamed
i meditated also on thy commandments which i loved
and i lifted up my hands to thy commandments which i loved and
be thou mindful of thy word to thy servant in which thou hast
given me hope
this hath comforted me in my humiliation because thy word hath
enlivened me
the proud did iniquitously altogether but i declined not from
thy law
i remembered o lord thy judgments of old and i was comforted
a fainting hath taken hold of me because of the wicked that
forsake thy law
thy justifications were the subject of my song in the place of
my pilgrimage
in the night i have remembered thy name o lord and have kept
thy law
this happened to me because i sought after thy justifications
o lord my portion i have said i would keep thy law
i entreated thy face with all my heart have mercy on me
according to thy word
i have thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy
testimonies
i am ready and am not troubled that i may keep thy
commandments
the cords of the wicked have encompassed me but i have not
forgotten thy law
i rose at midnight to give praise to thee for the judgments of
thy justification
i am a partaker with all them that fear thee and that keep thy
commandments
the earth o lord is full of thy mercy teach me thy
justifications
thou hast done well with thy servant o lord according to thy
word
teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge for i have
believed thy commandments
before i was humbled i offended therefore have i kept thy word
thou art good and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications
the iniquity of the proud hath been multiplied over me but i
will seek thy commandments with my whole heart
their heart is curdled like milk but i have meditated on thy
law
it is good for me that thou hast humbled me that i may learn
thy justifications
the law of thy mouth is good to me above thousands of gold and
silver
thy hands have made me and formed me give me understanding and
they that fear thee shall see me and shall be glad because i
have greatly hoped in thy words
i know o lord that thy judgments are equity and in thy truth
thou hast humbled me
o let thy mercy be for my comfort according to thy word unto
thy servant
let thy tender mercies come unto me and i shall live for thy
law is my meditation
let the proud be ashamed because they have done unjustly
towards me but i will be employed in thy commandments
let them that fear thee turn to me and they that know thy
testimonies
let my heart be undefiled in thy justifications that i may not
be confounded
my soul hath fainted after thy salvation and in thy word i have
very much hoped
my eyes have failed for thy word saying when wilt thou comfort
me
for i am become like a bottle in the frost i have not forgotten
thy justifications
how many are the days of thy servant when wilt thou execute
judgment on them that persecute me
the wicked have told me fables but not as thy law
all thy statutes are truth they have persecuted me unjustly do
thou help me
they had almost made an end of me upon earth but i have not
forsaken thy commandments
quicken thou me according to thy mercy and i shall keep the
testimonies of thy mouth
for ever o lord thy word standeth firm in heaven
thy truth unto all generations thou hast founded the earth and
it continueth
by thy ordinance the day goeth on for all things serve thee
unless thy law had been my meditation i had then perhaps
perished in my abjection
thy justifications i will never forget for by them thou hast
given me life
i am thine save thou me for i have sought thy justifications
the wicked have waited for me to destroy me but i have
understood thy testimonies
i have seen an end of all perfection thy commandment is
exceeding broad

day

enemies for it is ever with me

testimonies are my meditation

thy commandments
i have restrained my feet from every evil way that i may keep
thy words
i have not declined from thy judgments because thou hast set
me a law
how sweet are thy words to my palate more than honey to my
mouth
by thy commandments i have had understanding therefore have i
hated every way of iniquity
thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my paths
i have sworn and am determined to keep the judgments of thy
justice
i have been humbled o lord exceedingly quicken thou me
according to thy word
the free offerings of my mouth make acceptable o lord and
teach me thy judgments
my soul is continually in my hands and i have not forgotten
thy law
sinners have laid a snare for me but i have not erred from thy
precepts
i have purchased thy testimonies for an inheritance for ever
because they are the joy of my heart
i have inclined my heart to do thy justifications for ever for
the reward
i have hated the unjust and have loved thy law
thou art my helper and my protector and in thy word i have
greatly hoped

commandments of my god
uphold me according to thy word and i shall live and let me
not be confounded in my expectation
help me and i shall be saved and i will meditate always on
thy justifications
thou hast despised all them that fall off from thy judgments
for their thought is unjust
i have accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators
therefore have i loved thy testimonies
pierce thou my flesh with thy fear for i am afraid of thy
judgments
i have done judgment and justice give me not up to them that
slander me
uphold thy servant unto good let not the proud calumniate me

thy justice
deal with thy servant according to thy mercy and teach me thy
justifications

testimonies
it is time o lord to do they have dissipated thy law
therefore have i loved thy commandments above gold and the
topaz
therefore was i directed to all thy commandments i have hated
all wicked ways
thy testimonies are wonderful therefore my soul hath sought
them
the declaration of thy words giveth light and giveth
understanding to little ones
i opened my mouth and panted because i longed for thy
commandments
look thou upon me and have mercy on me according to the
judgment of them that love thy name
direct my steps according to thy word and let no iniquity have
dominion over me

commandments

justifications
my eyes have sent forth springs of water because they have not
kept thy law
thou art just o lord and thy judgment is right
thou hast commanded justice thy testimonies and thy truth
exceedingly
my zeal hath made me pine away because my enemies forgot thy
words

i am very young and despised but i forget not thy
justifications

meditation

justifications

i prevented the dawning of the day and cried because in thy
words i very much hoped
my eyes to thee have prevented the morning that i might
meditate on thy words
hear thou my voice o lord according to thy mercy and quicken
me according to thy judgment
they that persecute me have drawn nigh to iniquity but they
are gone far off from thy law

law

sake

justifications

judgment

declined from thy testimonies

not thy word
behold i have loved thy commandments o lord quicken me thou
in thy mercy
the beginning of thy words is truth all the judgments of thy
justice are for ever
princes have persecuted me without cause and my heart hath
been in awe of thy words
i will rejoice at thy words as one that hath found great
spoil
i have hated and abhorred iniquity but i have loved thy law
seven times a day i have given praise to thee for the
judgments of thy justice
much peace have they that love thy law and to them there is no
stumbling block
i looked for thy salvation o lord and i loved thy
commandments

exceedingly

my ways are in thy sight

called gradual psalms or canticles from the word gradus signifying
steps ascensions or degrees either because they were appointed to be
sung on the fifteen steps by which the people ascended to the temple
or that in the singing of them the voice was to be raised by certain
steps or ascensions or that they were to be sung by the people
returning from their captivity and ascending to jerusalem which was
seated amongst mountains the holy fathers in a mystical sense
understand these steps or ascensions of the degrees by which
temple of god in the heavenly jerusalem
in my trouble i cried to the lord and he heard me
o lord deliver my soul from wicked lips and a deceitful tongue
what shall be given to thee or what shall be added to thee to a
deceitful tongue
the sharp arrows of the mighty with coals that lay waste
woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged i have dwelt with the
inhabitants of cedar
my soul hath been long a sojourner
with them that hated peace i was peaceable when i spoke to them
they fought against me without cause

unto the end a psalm of david lord thou hast proved me and
known me
thou hast known my sitting down and my rising up
thou hast understood my thoughts afar off my path and my line
thou hast searched out
and thou hast foreseen all my ways for there is no speech in my
tongue
speech in my tongue yet my whole interior and my most secret thoughts
are known to thee
behold o lord thou hast known all things the last and those of
old thou hast formed me and hast laid thy hand upon me

uttermost parts of the sea
even there also shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall
hold me
and i said perhaps darkness shall cover me and night shall be
my light in my pleasures
but darkness shall not be dark to thee and night shall be light

unto the end a psalm of david
deliver me o lord from the evil man rescue me from the unjust
man
who have devised iniquities in their hearts all the day long
they designed battles
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent the venom of
asps is under their lips
keep me o lord from the hand of the wicked and from unjust men
deliver me who have proposed to supplant my steps
the proud have hidden a net for me and they have stretched out
cords for a snare they have laid for me a stumblingblock by the
wayside
i said to the lord thou art my god hear o lord the voice of
my supplication
o lord lord the strength of my salvation thou hast
overshadowed my head in the day of battle

plotted against me do not thou forsake me lest they should triumph

into the fire in miseries they shall not be able to stand
a man full of tongue shall not be established in the earth evil

upright shall dwell with thy countenance

let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight the lifting up
of my hands as evening sacrifice
set a watch o lord before my mouth and a door round about my
lips
incline not my heart to evil words to make excuses in sins with
men that work iniquity and i will not communicate with the choicest of
them
the just man shall correct me in mercy and shall reprove me but
let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head for my prayer shall still
be against the things with which they are well pleased
deceitful praiseibid for my prayer etc so far from coveting their
praises who are never well pleased but with things that are evil i
shall continually pray to be preserved from such things as they are
delighted with
their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up they
shall hear my words for they have prevailed
like ships dashed against the rocks and swallowed up by the waves let
them then hear my words for they are powerful and will prevail or as
it is in the hebrew for they are sweet
as when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground
but to thee o lord lord are my eyes in thee have i put my
trust take not away my soul
keep me from the snare which they have laid for me and from the
stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity
the wicked shall fall in his net i am alone until i pass
all their nets and snares
of understanding for david a prayer when he was in the cave
i cried to the lord with my voice with my voice i made
supplication to the lord
in his sight i pour out my prayer and before him i declare my
trouble
when my spirit failed me then thou knewest my paths in this way
wherein i walked they have hidden a snare for me
i looked on my right hand and beheld and there was no one that
would know me flight hath failed me and there is no one that hath
regard to my soul
i cried to thee o lord i said thou art my hope my portion in
the land of the living
attend to my supplication for i am brought very low deliver me
from my persecutors for they are stronger than i
bring my soul out of prison that i may praise thy name the just
wait for me until thou reward me
