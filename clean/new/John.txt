begins to call his disciples
in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the
the same was in the beginning with god
all things were made by him and without him was made nothing that
was made
in him was life and the life was the light of men
and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness did not
comprehend it
there was a man sent from god whose name was john
this man came for a witness to give testimony of the light that
all men might believe through him
he was not the light but was to give testimony of the light
that was the true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh
into this world
he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world
knew him not
he came unto his own and his own received him not
but as many as received him he gave them power to be made the
sons of god to them that believe in his name
who are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of
the will of man but of god
and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we saw his
glory the glory as it were of the only begotten of the father full of
grace and truth
john beareth witness of him and crieth out saying this was he of
whom i spoke he that shall come after me is preferred before me
because he was before me
and of his fulness we all have received and grace for grace
for the law was given by moses grace and truth came by jesus
no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son who is in
the bosom of the father he hath declared him
and this is the testimony of john when the jews sent from
and he confessed and did not deny and he confessed i am not the
and they asked him what then art thou elias and he said i am
not art thou the prophet and he answered no
they said therefore unto him who art thou that we may give an
answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself
he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make
straight the way of the lord as said the prophet isaias
and they that were sent were of the pharisees
and they asked him and said to him why then dost thou baptize if
thou be not christ nor elias nor the prophet
john answered them saying i baptize with water but there hath
stood one in the midst of you whom you know not
the same is he that shall come after me who is preferred before
me the latchet of whose shoe i am not worthy to loose
these things were done in bethania beyond the jordan where john
was baptizing
the next day john saw jesus coming to him and he saith behold
the lamb of god behold him who taketh away the sin of the world
this is he of whom i said after me there cometh a man who is
preferred before me because he was before me
and i knew him not but that he may be made manifest in israel
therefore am i come baptizing with water
and john gave testimony saying i saw the spirit coming down as
a dove from heaven and he remained upon him
and i knew him not but he who sent me to baptize with water said
to me he upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining
upon him he it is that baptizeth with the holy ghost
and i saw and i gave testimony that this is the son of god
the next day again john stood and two of his disciples
and beholding jesus walking he saith behold the lamb of god
and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus
and jesus turning and seeing them following him saith to them
interpreted master where dwellest thou
he saith to them come and see they came and saw where he abode
and they stayed with him that day now it was about the tenth hour
and andrew the brother of simon peter was one of the two who had
heard of john and followed him
he findeth first his brother simon and saith to him we have found
the messias which is being interpreted the christ
and he brought him to jesus and jesus looking upon him said
interpreted peter
on the following day he would go forth into galilee and he
findeth philip and jesus saith to him follow me
now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter
philip findeth nathanael and saith to him we have found him of
whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus the son of
and nathanael said to him can any thing of good come from
jesus saw nathanael coming to him and he saith of him behold an
nathanael saith to him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and
said to him before that philip called thee when thou wast under the
fig tree i saw thee
nathanael answered him and said rabbi thou art the son of god
jesus answered and said to him because i said unto thee i saw
thee under the fig tree thou believest greater things than these shalt
thou see
and he saith to him amen amen i say to you you shall see the
heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the
and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the
mother of jesus was there
and jesus also was invited and his disciples to the marriage
and the wine failing the mother of jesus saith to him they have
no wine
and jesus saith to her woman what is that to me and to thee my
hour is not yet come
mother have been understood by some commentators as harsh they not
considering the next following verse whatsoever he shall say to you do
ye which plainly shows that his mother knew of the miracle that he was
to perform and that it was at her request he wrought it besides the
manner of speaking the words as to the tone and the countenance shown
at the same time which could only be known to those who were present
or from what had followed for words indicating anger in one tone of
voice would be understood quite the reverse in another
his mother saith to the waiters whatsoever he shall say to you do
ye
now there were set there six waterpots of stone according to the
manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three measures
apiece
jesus saith to them fill the waterpots with water and they filled
them up to the brim
and jesus saith to them draw out now and carry to the chief
steward of the feast and they carried it
and when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine and knew
not whence it was but the waiters knew who had drawn the water the
chief steward calleth the bridegroom
and saith to him every man at first setteth forth good wine and
when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept
the good wine until now
this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and
manifested his glory and his disciples believed in him
after this he went down to capharnaum he and his mother and his
brethren and his disciples and they remained there not many days
and the pasch of the jews was at hand and jesus went up to
and he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep and
doves and the changers of money sitting
and when he had made as it were a scourge of little cords he
drove them all out of the temple the sheep also and the oxen and the
money of the changers he poured out and the tables he overthrew
and to them that sold doves he said take these things hence and
make not the house of my father a house of traffic
and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thy
house hath eaten me up
the jews therefore answered and said to him what sign dost
thou shew unto us seeing thou dost these things
jesus answered and said to them destroy this temple and in three
days i will raise it up
the jews then said six and forty years was this temple in
building and wilt thou raise it up in three days
but he spoke of the temple of his body
when therefore he was risen again from the dead his disciples
remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and
the word that jesus had said
now when he was at jerusalem at the pasch upon the festival day
many believed in his name seeing his signs which he did
but jesus did not trust himself unto them for that he knew all
men
and because he needed not that any should give testimony of man
for he knew what was in man
and there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of
the jews
this man came to jesus by night and said to him rabbi we know
that thou art come a teacher from god for no man can do these signs
which thou dost unless god be with him
jesus answered and said to him amen amen i say to thee unless a
man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
nicodemus saith to him how can a man be born when he is old can
he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born again
jesus answered amen amen i say to thee unless a man be born
again of water and the holy ghost he cannot enter into the kingdom of
declared the necessity of baptism and by the word water it is evident
that the application of it is necessary with the words matt
that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of
the spirit is spirit
wonder not that i said to thee you must be born again
the spirit breatheth where he will and thou hearest his voice but
thou knowest not whence he cometh and whither he goeth so is every one
that is born of the spirit
nicodemus answered and said to him how can these things be done
jesus answered and said to him art thou a master in israel and
knowest not these things
amen amen i say to thee that we speak what we know and we
testify what we have seen and you receive not our testimony
if i have spoken to you earthly things and you believe not how
will you believe if i shall speak to you heavenly things
and no man hath ascended into heaven but he that descended from
heaven the son of man who is in heaven
and as moses lifted up the serpent in the desert so must the son
of man be lifted up
that whosoever believeth in him may not perish but may have life
everlasting
for god so loved the world as to give his only begotten son that
whosoever believeth in him may not perish but may have life
everlasting
for god sent not his son into the world to judge the world but
that the world may be saved by him
he that believeth in him is not judged but he that doth not
believe is already judged because he believeth not in the name of the
only begotten son of god
charity is not judged that is is not condemned but the obstinate
unbeliever is judged that is condemned already by retrenching himself
from the society of christ and his church
and this is the judgment because the light is come into the world
and men loved darkness rather than the light for their works were evil
for every one that doth evil hateth the light and cometh not to
the light that his works may not be reproved
but he that doth truth cometh to the light that his works may be
made manifest because they are done in god
here signifies the law of god thy law is truth psa
after these things jesus and his disciples came into the land of
and john also was baptizing in ennon near salim because there was
much water there and they came and were baptized
for john was not yet cast into prison
and there arose a question between some of johns disciples and
the jews concerning purification
and they came to john and said to him rabbi he that was with
thee beyond the jordan to whom thou gavest testimony behold he
baptizeth and all men come to him
john answered and said a man cannot receive any thing unless it
be given him from heaven
you yourselves do bear me witness that i said that i am not
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the
bridegroom who standeth and heareth him rejoiceth with joy because of
the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled
he must increase but i must decrease
he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth
of the earth he is and of the earth he speaketh he that cometh from
heaven is above all
and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man
receiveth his testimony
he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god
is true
for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god doth
not give the spirit by measure
the father loveth the son and he hath given all things into his
hand
he that believeth in the son hath life everlasting but he that
believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth
on him
when jesus therefore understood the pharisees had heard that jesus
maketh more disciples and baptizeth more than john
though jesus himself did not baptize but his disciples
he left judea and went again into galilee
and he was of necessity to pass through samaria
he cometh therefore to a city of samaria which is called sichar
near the land which jacob gave to his son joseph
now jacobs well was there jesus therefore being wearied with his
journey sat thus on the well it was about the sixth hour
there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith to her
for his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats
then that samaritan woman saith to him how dost thou being a jew
ask of me to drink who am a samaritan woman for the jews do not
communicate with the samaritans
jesus answered and said to her if thou didst know the gift of god
and who he is that saith to thee give me to drink thou perhaps wouldst
have asked of him and he would have given thee living water
the woman saith to him sir thou hast nothing wherein to draw
and the well is deep from whence then hast thou living water
art thou greater than our father jacob who gave us the well and
drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle
jesus answered and said to her whosoever drinketh of this water
shall thirst again but he that shall drink of the water that i will
give him shall not thirst for ever
but the water that i will give him shall become in him a fountain
of water springing up into life everlasting
the woman said to him sir give me this water that i may not
thirst nor come hither to draw
jesus saith to her go call thy husband and come hither
the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said to her
for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not
thy husband this thou hast said truly
the woman saith to him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet
our fathers adored on this mountain and you say that at jerusalem
is the place where men must adore
temple
jesus saith to her woman believe me that the hour cometh when
you shall neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem adore the father
you adore that which you know not we adore that which we know
but the hour cometh and now is when the true adorers shall adore
the father in spirit and in truth for the father also seeketh such to
adore him
god is a spirit and they that adore him must adore him in spirit
and in truth
the woman saith to him i know that the messias cometh who is
called christ therefore when he is come he will tell us all things
jesus saith to her i am he who am speaking with thee
and immediately his disciples came and they wondered that he
talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why
talkest thou with her
the woman therefore left her waterpot and went her way into the
city and saith to the men there
come and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever i have
done is not he the christ
they went therefore out of the city and came unto him
in the mean time the disciples prayed him saying rabbi eat
but he said to them i have meat to eat which you know not
the disciples therefore said one to another hath any man brought
him to eat
jesus saith to them my meat is to do the will of him that sent
me that i may perfect his work
do not you say there are yet four months and then the harvest
cometh behold i say to you lift up your eyes and see the countries
and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life
everlasting that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice
together
for in this is the saying true that it is one man that soweth
and it is another that reapeth
i have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour others
have laboured and you have entered into their labours
now of that city many of the samaritans believed in him for the
word of the woman giving testimony he told me all things whatsoever i
have done
so when the samaritans were come to him they desired that he
would tarry there and he abode there two days
and many more believed in him because of his own word
and they said to the woman we now believe not for thy saying
for we ourselves have heard him and know that this is indeed the saviour
of the world
now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee
for jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in
his own country
and when he was come into galilee the galileans received him
having seen all the things he had done at jerusalem on the festival day
for they also went to the festival day
he came again therefore into cana of galilee where he made the
water wine and there was a certain ruler whose son was sick at
he having heard that jesus was come from judea into galilee sent
to him and prayed him to come down and heal his son for he was at the
point of death
jesus therefore said to him unless you see signs and wonders you
believe not
the ruler saith to him lord come down before that my son die
jesus saith to him go thy way thy son liveth the man believed
the word which jesus said to him and went his way
and as he was going down his servants met him and they brought
word saying that his son lived
he asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better and
they said to him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him
the father therefore knew that it was at the same hour that jesus
said to him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house
this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come
out of judea into galilee
discourse upon this occasion
after these things was a festival day of the jews and jesus went
up to jerusalem
now there is at jerusalem a pond called probatica which in hebrew
is named bethsaida having five porches
sheep were washed therein that were to be offered up in sacrifice in
the temple or because it was near the sheep gate that this was a pond
where miracles were wrought is evident from the sacred text and also
that the water had no natural virtue to heal as one only of those put
in after the motion of the water was restored to health for if the
water had the healing quality the others would have the like benefit
being put into it about the same time
in these lay a great multitude of sick of blind of lame of
withered waiting for the moving of the water
and an angel of the lord descended at certain times into the pond
and the water was moved and he that went down first into the pond after
the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay
under
and there was a certain man there that had been eight and thirty
years under his infirmity
him when jesus had seen lying and knew that he had been now a long
time he saith to him wilt thou be made whole
the infirm man answered him sir i have no man when the water is
troubled to put me into the pond for whilst i am coming another goeth
down before me
jesus saith to him arise take up thy bed and walk
and immediately the man was made whole and he took up his bed and
walked and it was the sabbath that day
the jews therefore said to him that was healed it is the sabbath
he answered them he that made me whole he said to me take up
thy bed and walk
they asked him therefore who is that man who said to thee take
up thy bed and walk
but he who was healed knew not who it was for jesus went aside
from the multitude standing in the place
afterwards jesus findeth him in the temple and saith to him
thee
the man went his way and told the jews that it was jesus who had
made him whole
therefore did the jews persecute jesus because he did these
things on the sabbath
but jesus answered them my father worketh until now and i work
hereupon therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because
he did not only break the sabbath but also said god was his father
making himself equal to god
then jesus answered and said to them amen amen i say unto you
the son cannot do any thing of himself but what he seeth the father
doing for what things soever he doth these the son also doth in like
manner
for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things which
himself doth and greater works than these will he shew him that you
may wonder
for as the father raiseth up the dead and giveth life so the son
also giveth life to whom he will
for neither does the father judge any man but hath given all
judgment to the son
that all men may honour the son as they honour the father he who
honoureth not the son honoureth not the father who hath sent him
amen amen i say unto you that he who heareth my word and
believeth him that sent me hath life everlasting and cometh not into
judgment but is passed from death to life
amen amen i say unto you that the hour cometh and now is when
the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear
shall live
for as the father hath life in himself so he hath given to the
and he hath given him power to do judgment because he is the son
of man
wonder not at this for the hour cometh wherein all that are in
the graves shall hear the voice of the son of god
and they that have done good things shall come forth unto the
resurrection of life but they that have done evil unto the
resurrection of judgment
i cannot of myself do any thing as i hear so i judge and my
judgment is just because i seek not my own will but the will of him
that sent me
if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true
there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the
witness which he witnesseth of me is true
you sent to john and he gave testimony to the truth
but i receive not testimony from man but i say these things that
you may be saved
he was a burning and a shining light and you were willing for a
time to rejoice in his light
but i have a greater testimony than that of john for the works
which the father hath given me to perfect the works themselves which i
do give testimony of me that the father hath sent me
and the father himself who hath sent me hath given testimony of
me neither have you heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape
and you have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent
him you believe not
search the scriptures for you think in them to have life
everlasting and the same are they that give testimony of me
all to read the scriptures but a reproach to the pharisees that
reading the scriptures as they did and thinking to find everlasting
life in them they would not receive him to whom all those scriptures
gave testimony and through whom alone they could have that true life
and you will not come to me that you may have life
i receive not glory from men
but i know you that you have not the love of god in you
i am come in the name of my father and you receive me not if
another shall come in his own name him you will receive
how can you believe who receive glory one from another and the
glory which is from god alone you do not seek
think not that i will accuse you to the father there is one that
accuseth you moses in whom you trust
for if you did believe moses you would perhaps believe me also
for he wrote of me
but if you do not believe his writings how will you believe my
words
discourses of the bread of life
after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is
that of tiberias
and a great multitude followed him because they saw the miracles
which he did on them that were diseased
jesus therefore went up into a mountain and there he sat with his
disciples
now the pasch the festival day of the jews was near at hand
when jesus therefore had lifted up his eyes and seen that a very
great multitude cometh to him he said to philip whence shall we buy
bread that these may eat
and this he said to try him for he himself knew what he would do
philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
sufficient for them that every one may take a little
one of his disciples andrew the brother of simon peter saith to
him
there is a boy here that hath five barley loaves and two fishes
then jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass
in the place the men therefore sat down in number about five thousand
and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he
distributed to them that were set down in like manner also of the
fishes as much as they would
and when they were filled he said to his disciples gather up the
fragments that remain lest they be lost
they gathered up therefore and filled twelve baskets with the
fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above to
them that had eaten
now those men when they had seen what a miracle jesus had done
said this is of a truth the prophet that is to come into the world
jesus therefore when he knew that they would come to take him by
force and make him king fled again into the mountains himself alone
and when evening was come his disciples went down to the sea
and when they had gone up into a ship they went over the sea to
and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew
when they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty
furlongs they see jesus walking upon the sea and drawing nigh to the
ship and they were afraid
but he saith to them it is i be not afraid
they were willing therefore to take him into the ship and
presently the ship was at the land to which they were going
the next day the multitude that stood on the other side of the
sea saw that there was no other ship there but one and that jesus had
not entered into the ship with his disciples but that his disciples
were gone away alone
but other ships came in from tiberias nigh unto the place where
they had eaten the bread the lord giving thanks
when therefore the multitude saw that jesus was not there nor his
disciples they took shipping and came to capharnaum seeking for jesus
and when they had found him on that other side of the sea they
said to him rabbi when camest thou hither
jesus answered them and said amen amen i say to you you seek
me not because you have seen miracles but because you did eat of the
loaves and were filled
labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that which
endureth unto life everlasting which the son of man will give you for
him hath god the father sealed
they said therefore unto him what shall we do that we may work
the works of god
jesus answered and said to them this is the work of god that you
believe in him whom he hath sent
they said therefore to him what sign therefore dost thou shew
that we may see and may believe thee what dost thou work
our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave
them bread from heaven to eat
then jesus said to them amen amen i say to you moses gave you
not bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from
heaven
for the bread of god is that which cometh down from heaven and
giveth life to the world
they said therefore unto him lord give us always this bread
and jesus said to them i am the bread of life he that cometh to
me shall not hunger and he that believeth in me shall never thirst
but i said unto you that you also have seen me and you believe
not
all that the father giveth to me shall come to me and him that
cometh to me i will not cast out
because i came down from heaven not to do my own will but the
will of him that sent me
now this is the will of the father who sent me that of all that
he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again in
the last day
and this is the will of my father that sent me that every one who
seeth the son and believeth in him may have life everlasting and i will
raise him up in the last day
the jews therefore murmured at him because he had said i am the
living bread which came down from heaven
and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father
and mother we know how then saith he i came down from heaven
jesus therefore answered and said to them murmur not among
yourselves
no man can come to me except the father who hath sent me draw
him and i will raise him up in the last day
necessity but by the strong and sweet motions of his heavenly grace
it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of
forth me
not that any man hath seen the father but he who is of god he
hath seen the father
amen amen i say unto you he that believeth in me hath
everlasting life
i am the bread of life
your fathers did eat manna in the desert and are dead
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that if any man
eat of it he may not die
i am the living bread which came down from heaven
if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the
bread that i will give is my flesh for the life of the world
the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this
man give us his flesh to eat
then jesus said to them amen amen i say unto you except you
eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you shall not have
life in you
fulfil though they receive but in one kind because in one kind they
receive both body and blood which cannot be separated from each other
in one kind ver if any man eat of this bread he shall live for
ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh for the life of the
world ver he that eateth me the same also shall live by me ver
he that eateth this bread shall liver for ever
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting
life and i will raise him up in the last day
for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me and i
in him
as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he
that eateth me the same also shall live by me
this is the bread that came down from heaven not as your fathers
did eat manna and are dead he that eateth this bread shall live for
ever
these things he said teaching in the synagogue in capharnaum
many therefore of his disciples hearing it said this saying is
hard and who can hear it
but jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this
said to them doth this scandalize you
if then you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was
before
this instance of his power and divinity would confirm the truth of what
he had before asserted and at the same time correct their gross
apprehension of eating his flesh and drinking his blood in a vulgar
and carnal manner by letting them know he should take his whole body
living with him to heaven and consequently not suffer it to be as they
supposed divided mangled and consumed upon earth
it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the
words that i have spoken to you are spirit and life
the gross manner they supposed they were to eat his flesh would profit
nothing neither doth mans flesh that is to say mans natural and
carnal apprehension which refuses to be subject to the spirit and
words of christ profit any thing but it would be the height of
blasphemy to say the living flesh of christ which we receive in the
blessed sacarament with his spirit that is with his soul and
divinity profiteth nothing for if christs flesh had profitedus
nothing he would never have taken flesh for us nor died in us nothing
he would never have taken flesh for us nor died in the flesh for us
which you shall receive in a wonderful manner spirit grace and life
in its very fountain
but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from
the beginning who they were that did not believe and who he was that
would betray him
and he said therefore did i say to you that no man can come to
me unless it be given him by my father
after this many of his disciples went back and walked no more
with him
then jesus said to the twelve will you also go away
and simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou
hast the words of eternal life
and we have believed and have known that thou art the christ the
jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you
is a devil
now he meant judas iscariot the son of simon for this same was
about to betray him whereas he was one of the twelve
temple
after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk
in judea because the jews sought to kill him
now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand
and his brethren said to him pass from hence and go into judea
that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost
for there is no man that doth any thing in secret and he himself
seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things manifest thyself to
the world
for neither did his brethren believe in him
then jesus said to them my time is not yet come but your time is
always ready
the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i give
testimony of it that the works thereof are evil
go you up to this festival day but i go not up to this festival
day because my time is not accomplished
when he had said these things he himself stayed in galilee
but after his brethren were gone up then he also went up to the
feast not openly but as it were in secret
the jews therefore sought him on the festival day and said where
is he
and there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him
the people
yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the jews
now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple
and taught
and the jews wondered saying how doth this man know letters
having never learned
jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his
that sent me
if any man will do the will of him he shall know of the doctrine
whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that
seeketh the glory of him that sent him he is true and there is no
injustice in him
did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the
law
why seek you to kill me the multitude answered and said thou
hast a devil who seeketh to kill thee
jesus answered and said to them one work i have done and you all
wonder
therefore moses gave you circumcision not because it is of
if a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day that the law of
whole man on the sabbath day
judge not according to the appearance but judge just judgment
some therefore of jerusalem said is not this he whom they seek to
kill
and behold he speaketh openly and they say nothing to him have
the rulers known for a truth that this is the christ
but we know this man whence he is but when the christ cometh no
man knoweth whence he is
jesus therefore cried out in the temple teaching and saying you
both know me and you know whence i am and i am not come of myself but
he that sent me is true whom you know not
i know him because i am from him and he hath sent me
they sought therefore to apprehend him and no man laid hands on
him because his hour was not yet come
but of the people many believed in him and said when the christ
cometh shall he do more miracles than this man doth
the pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning
him and the rulers and pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him
jesus therefore said to them yet a little while i am with you
and then i go to him that sent me
you shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither
you cannot come
the jews therefore said among themselves whither will he go that
we shall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles
and teach the gentiles
what is this saying that he hath said you shall seek me and shall
not find me and where i am you cannot come
and on the last and great day of the festivity jesus stood and
cried saying if any man thirst let him come to me and drink
he that believeth in me as the scripture saith out of his belly
shall flow rivers of living water
now this he said of the spirit which they should receive who
believed in him for as yet the spirit was not given because jesus was
not yet glorified
of that multitude therefore when they had heard these words of
his some said this is the prophet indeed
others said this is the christ but some said doth the christ
come out of galilee
doth not the scripture say that christ cometh of the seed of
so there arose a dissension among the people because of him
and some of them would have apprehended him but no man laid hands
upon him
the ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the
the ministers answered never did man speak like this man
the pharisees therefore answered them are you also seduced
hath any one of the rulers believed in him or of the pharisees
but this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed
nicodemus said to them he that came to him by night who was one
of them
doth our law judge any man unless it first hear him and know what
he doth
they answered and said to him art thou also a galilean search
the scriptures and see that out of galilee a prophet riseth not
and every man returned to his own house
and jesus went unto mount olivet
and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the
people came to him and sitting down he taught them
and the scribes and pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in
adultery and they set her in the midst
and said to him master this woman was even now taken in adultery
now moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one but what
sayest thou
and this they said tempting him that they might accuse him but
when therefore they continued asking him he lifted up himself and
said to them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a
stone at her
and again stooping down he wrote on the ground
but they hearing this went out one by one beginning at the
eldest and jesus alone remained and the woman standing in the midst
then jesus lifting up himself said to her woman where are they
that accused thee hath no man condemned thee
who said no man lord and jesus said neither will i condemn
thee go and now sin no more
again therefore jesus spoke to them saying i am the light of
the world he that followeth me walketh not in darkness but shall have
the light of life
the pharisees therefore said to him thou givest testimony of
thyself thy testimony is not true
jesus answered and said to them although i give testimony of
myself my testimony is true for i know whence i came and whither i go
you judge according to the flesh i judge not any man
and if i do judge my judgment is true because i am not alone
but i and the father that sent me
and in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is
true
i am one that give testimony of myself and the father that sent
me giveth testimony of me
they said therefore to him where is thy father jesus answered
would know my father also
these words jesus spoke in the treasury teaching in the temple
and no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come
again therefore jesus said to them i go and you shall seek me
the jews therefore said will he kill himself because he said
and he said to them you are from beneath i am from above you
are of this world i am not of this world
therefore i said to you that you shall die in your sins for if
you believe not that i am he you shall die in your sin
they said therefore to him who art thou jesus said to them the
beginning who also speak unto you
many things i have to speak and to judge of you but he that sent
me is true and the things i have heard of him these same i speak in
the world
and they understood not that he called god his father
jesus therefore said to them when you shall have lifted up the
myself but as the father hath taught me these things i speak
and he that sent me is with me and he hath not left me alone for
when he spoke these things many believed in him
then jesus said to those jews who believed him if you continue in
my word you shall be my disciples indeed
and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
they answered him we are the seed of abraham and we have never
been slaves to any man how sayest thou you shall be free
jesus answered them amen amen i say unto you that whosoever
committeth sin is the servant of sin
now the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son
abideth for ever
if therefore the son shall make you free you shall be free
indeed
i know that you are the children of abraham but you seek to kill
me because my word hath no place in you
i speak that which i have seen with my father and you do the
things that you have seen with your father
they answered and said to him abraham is our father jesus saith
them if you be the children of abraham do the works of abraham
but now you seek to kill me a man who have spoken the truth to
you which i have heard of god this abraham did not
you do the works of your father they said therefore to him we
are not born of fornication we have one father even god
jesus therefore said to them if god were your father you would
indeed love me for from god i proceeded and came for i came not of
myself but he sent me
why do you not know my speech because you cannot hear my word
you are of your father the devil and the desires of your father
you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and he stood not in
the truth because truth is not in him when he speaketh a lie he
speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father thereof
but if i say the truth you believe me not
which of you shall convince me of sin if i say the truth to you
why do you not believe me
he that is of god heareth the words of god therefore you hear
them not because you are not of god
the jews therefore answered and said to him do not we say well
that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil
jesus answered i have not a devil but i honour my father and
you have dishonoured me
but i seek not my own glory there is one that seeketh and
judgeth
amen amen i say to you if any man keep my word he shall not
see death for ever
the jews therefore said now we know that thou hast a devil
word he shall not taste death for ever
art thou greater than our father abraham who is dead and the
prophets are dead whom dost thou make thyself
jesus answered if i glorify myself my glory is nothing it is
my father that glorifieth me of whom you say that he is your god
and you have not known him but i know him and if i shall say
that i know him not i shall be like to you a liar but i do know him
and do keep his word
abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day he saw it
and was glad
the jews therefore said to him thou art not yet fifty years old
jesus said to them amen amen i say to you before abraham was
made i am
they took up stones therefore to cast at him but jesus hid
himself and went out of the temple
and jesus passing by saw a man who was blind from his birth
and his disciples asked him rabbi who hath sinned this man or
his parents that he should be born blind
jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but
that the works of god should be made manifest in him
i must work the works of him that sent me whilst it is day the
night cometh when no man can work
as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
when he had said these things he spat on the ground and made clay
of the spittle and spread the clay upon his eyes
and said to him go wash in the pool of siloe which is
interpreted sent he went therefore and washed and he came seeing
the neighbours therefore and they who had seen him before that he
was a beggar said is not this he that sat and begged some said this
is he
but others said no but he is like him but he said i am he
they said therefore to him how were thy eyes opened
he answered that man that is called jesus made clay and anointed
my eyes and said to me go to the pool of siloe and wash and i went i
washed and i see
and they said to him where is he he saith i know not
they bring him that had been blind to the pharisees
now it was the sabbath when jesus made the clay and opened his
eyes
again therefore the pharisees asked him how he had received his
sight but he said to them he put clay upon my eyes and i washed and
some therefore of the pharisees said this man is not of god who
keepeth not the sabbath but others said how can a man that is a sinner
do such miracles and there was a division among them
they say therefore to the blind man again what sayest thou of him
that hath opened thy eyes and he said he is a prophet
the jews then did not believe concerning him that he had been
blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of him
that had received his sight
and asked them saying is this your son who you say was born
blind how then doth he now see
his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son
and that he was born blind
but how he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we
know not ask himself he is of age let him speak for himself
these things his parents said because they feared the jews for
the jews had already agreed among themselves that if any man should
confess him to be christ he should be put out of the synagogue
therefore did his parents say he is of age ask himself
they therefore called the man again that had been blind and said
to him give glory to god we know that this man is a sinner
he said therefore to them if he be a sinner i know not one
thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see
they said then to him what did he to thee how did he open thy
eyes
he answered them i have told you already and you have heard why
would you hear it again will you also become his disciples
they reviled him therefore and said be thou his disciple but we
are the disciples of moses
we know that god spoke to moses but as to this man we know not
from whence he is
the man answered and said to them why herein is a wonderful
thing that you know not from whence he is and he hath opened my eyes
now we know that god doth not hear sinners but if a man be a
server of god and doth his will him he heareth
from the beginning of the world it hath not been heard that any
man hath opened the eyes of one born blind
unless this man were of god he could not do anything
they answered and said to him thou wast wholly born in sins and
dost thou teach us and they cast him out
jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him
he said to him dost thou believe in the son of god
he answered and said who is he lord that i may believe in him
and jesus said to him thou hast both seen him and it is he that
talketh with thee
and he said i believe lord and falling down he adored him
and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they
who see not may see and they who see may become blind
be made blind but that the jews by the abuse of his coming and by
their not receiving him brought upon themselves this judgment of
blindness
and some of the pharisees who were with him heard and they said
unto him are we also blind
jesus said to them if you were blind you should not have sin
but now you say we see your sin remaineth
neither read the scriptures nor seen my miracles you would not be
guilty of the sin of infidelity but now as you boast of your knowledge
of the scriptures you are inexcusable
amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into
the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a
robber
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he
calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out
and when he hath let out his own sheep he goeth before them and
the sheep follow him because they know his voice
but a stranger they follow not but fly from him because they
know not the voice of strangers
this proverb jesus spoke to them but they understood not what he
spoke
jesus therefore said to them again amen amen i say to you i am
the door of the sheep
all others as many as have come are thieves and robbers and the
sheep heard them not
i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and
he shall go in and go out and shall find pastures
the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to
destroy i am come that they may have life and may have it more
abundantly
i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for his
sheep
but the hireling and he that is not the shepherd whose own the
sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and flieth
and the wolf casteth and scattereth the sheep
and the hireling flieth because he is a hireling and he hath no
care for the sheep
i am the good shepherd and i know mine and mine know me
as the father knoweth me and i know the father and i lay down
my life for my sheep
and other sheep i have that are not of this fold them also i
must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold
and one shepherd
therefore doth the father love me because i lay down my life
that i may take it again
no man taketh it away from me but i lay it down of myself and
commandment have i received of my father
a dissension rose again among the jews for these words
and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear you
him
others said these are not the words of one that hath a devil
and it was the feast of the dedication at jerusalem and it was
winter
and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch
the jews therefore came round about him and said to him how long
dost thou hold our souls in suspense if thou be the christ tell us
plainly
jesus answered them i speak to you and you believe not the
works that i do in the name of my father they give testimony of me
but you do not believe because you are not of my sheep
my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
and i give them life everlasting and they shall not perish for
ever and no man shall pluck them out of my hand
that which my father hath given me is greater than all and no
one can snatch them out of the hand of my father
i and the father are one
persons
the jews then took up stones to stone him
jesus answered them many good works i have shewed you from my
the jews answered him for a good work we stone thee not but for
blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god
jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said you
are gods
if he called them gods to whom the word of god was spoken and
the scripture cannot be broken
do you say of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into
the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god
if i do not the works of my father believe me not
but if i do though you will not believe me believe the works
that you may know and believe that the father is in me and i in the
they sought therefore to take him and he escaped out of their
hands
and he went again beyond the jordan into that place where john
was baptizing first and there he abode
and many resorted to him and they said john indeed did no sign
but all things whatsoever john said of this man were true and
many believed n him
now there was a certain man sick named lazarus of bethania of
the town of mary and of martha her sister
and mary was she that anointed the lord with ointment and wiped
his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick
his sisters therefore sent to him saying lord behold he whom
thou lovest is sick
and jesus hearing it said to them this sickness is not unto
death but for the glory of god that the son of god may be glorified by
it
now jesus loved martha and her sister mary and lazarus
when he had heard therefore that he was sick he still remained in
the same place two days
then after that he said to his disciples let us go into judea
again
the disciples say to him rabbi the jews but now sought to stone
thee and goest thou thither again
jesus answered are there not twelve hours of the day if a man
walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this
world
but if he walk in the night he stumbleth because the light is
not in him
these things he said and after that he said to them lazarus our
friend sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep
his disciples therefore said lord if he sleep he shall do
well
but jesus spoke of his death and they thought that he spoke of
the repose of sleep
then therefore jesus said to them plainly lazarus is dead
and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there that you may
believe but let us go to him
thomas therefore who is called didymus said to his fellow
disciples let us also go that we may die with him
jesus therefore came and found that he had been four days
already in the grave
now bethania was near jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off
and many of the jews were come to martha and mary to comfort
them concerning their brother
martha therefore as soon as she heard that jesus was come went
to meet him but mary sat at home
martha therefore said to jesus lord if thou hadst been here my
brother had not died
but now also i know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god
will give it thee
jesus saith to her thy brother shall rise again
martha saith to him i know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection at the last day
jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life he that
believeth in me although he be dead shall live
and every one that liveth and believeth in me shall not die for
ever believest thou this
she saith to him yea lord i have believed that thou art
and when she had said these things she went and called her
sister mary secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee
she as soon as she heard this riseth quickly and cometh to him
for jesus was not yet come into the town but he was still in
that place where martha had met him
the jews therefore who were with her in the house and comforted
her when they saw mary that she rose up speedily and went out
followed her saying she goeth to the grave to weep there
when mary therefore was come where jesus was seeing him she
fell down at his feet and saith to him lord if thou hadst been here
my brother had not died
jesus therefore when he saw her weeping and the jews that were
come with her weeping groaned in the spirit and troubled himself
and said where have you laid him they say to him lord come
and see
and jesus wept
the jews therefore said behold how he loved him
but some of them said could not he that opened the eyes of the
man born blind have caused that this man should not die
jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the
sepulchre now it was a cave and a stone was laid over it
jesus saith take away the stone martha the sister of him that
was dead saith to him lord by this time he stinketh for he is now of
four days
jesus saith to her did not i say to thee that if thou believe
thou shalt see the glory of god
they took therefore the stone away and jesus lifting up his
eyes said father i give thee thanks that thou hast heard me
and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people
who stand about have i said it that they may believe that thou hast
sent me
when he had said these things he cried with a loud voice
and presently he that had been dead came forth bound feet and
hands with winding bands and his face was bound about with a napkin
many therefore of the jews who were come to mary and martha and
had seen the things that jesus did believed in him
but some of them went to the pharisees and told them the things
that jesus had done
the chief priests therefore and the pharisees gathered a
council and said what do we for this man doth many miracles
if we let him alone so all will believe in him and the romans
will come and take away our place and nation
but one of them named caiphas being the high priest that year
said to them you know nothing
neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man
should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not
and this he spoke not of himself but being the high priest of
that year he prophesied that jesus should die for the nation
and not only for the nation but to gather together in one the
children of god that were dispersed
from that day therefore they devised to put him to death
wherefore jesus walked no more openly among the jews but he went
into a country near the desert unto a city that is called ephrem and
there he abode with his disciples
and the pasch of the jews was at hand and many from the country
went up to jerusalem before the pasch to purify themselves
they sought therefore for jesus and they discoursed one with
another standing in the temple what think you that he is not come to
the festival day and the chief priests and pharisees had given a
commandment that if any man knew where he was he should tell that
they might apprehend him
voice from heaven
jesus therefore six days before the pasch came to bethania
where lazarus had been dead whom jesus raised to life
and they made him a supper there and martha served but lazarus
was one of them that were at table with him
mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard of
great price and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her
hair and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment
then one of his disciples judas iscariot he that was about to
betray him said
why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given
to the poor
now he said this not because he cared for the poor but because he
was a thief and having the purse carried the things that were put
therein
jesus therefore said let her alone that she may keep it against
the day of my burial
for the poor you have always with you but me you have not always
a great multitude therefore of the jews knew that he was there
and they came not for jesus sake only but that they might see
but the chief priests thought to kill lazarus also
because many of the jews by reason of him went away and
believed in jesus
and on the next day a great multitude that was come to the
festival day when they had heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem
took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried
and jesus found a young ass and sat upon it as it is written
fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh sitting on an
asss colt
these things his disciples did not know at the first but when
of him and that they had done these things to him
the multitude therefore gave testimony which was with him when
he called lazarus out of the grave and raised him from the dead
for which reason also the people came to meet him because they
heard that he had done this miracle
the pharisees therefore said among themselves do you see that we
prevail nothing behold the whole world is gone after him
now there were certain gentiles among them who came up to adore
on the festival day
these therefore came to philip who was of bethsaida of galilee
and desired him saying sir we would see jesus
philip cometh and telleth andrew again andrew and philip told
but jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of
man should be glorified
amen amen i say to you unless the grain of wheat falling into
the ground die
itself remaineth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much
fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life
in this world keepeth it unto life eternal
if any man minister to me let him follow me and where i am
there also shall my minister be if any man minister to me him will my
now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me
from this hour but for this cause i came unto this hour
father glorify thy name a voice therefore came from heaven i
have both glorified it and will glorify it again
the multitude therefore that stood and heard said that it
thundered others said an angel spoke to him
jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but
for your sakes
now is the judgment of the world now shall the prince of this
world be cast out
and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all things to
myself
now this he said signifying what death he should die
the multitude answered him we have heard out of the law that
lifted up who is this son of man
jesus therefore said to them yet a little while the light is
among you walk whilst you have the light and the darkness overtake you
not and he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither be goeth
whilst you have the light believe in the light that you may be
the children of light these things jesus spoke and he went away and
hid himself from them
and whereas he had done so many miracles before them they
believed not in him
that the saying of isaias the prophet might be fulfilled which
he said lord who hath believed our hearing and to whom hath the arm
of the lord been revealed
therefore they could not believe because isaias said again
he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they
should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be
converted and i should heal them
these things said isaias when he saw his glory and spoke of
him
however many of the chief men also believed in him but because
of the pharisees they did not confess him that they might not be cast
out of the synagogue
for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of god
but jesus cried and said he that believeth in me doth not
believe in me but in him that sent me
and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me
i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth in me
may not remain in darkness
and if any man hear my words and keep them not i do not judge
him for i came not to judge the world but to save the world
he that despiseth me and receiveth not my words hath one that
judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in
the last day
for i have not spoken of myself but the father who sent me he
gave me commandment what i should say and what i should speak
and i know that his commandment is life everlasting the things
therefore that i speak even as the father said unto me so do i speak
commandment of love
before the festival day of the pasch jesus knowing that his hour
was come that he should pass out of this world to the father having
loved his own who were in the world he loved them unto the end
pasch of the ministry of christ and according to the common
computation was in the thirtythird year of our lord and in the year
of the world some chronologers are of opinion that our saviour
suffered in the thirtyseventh year of his age but these different
opinions on this subject are of no consequence
and when supper was done the devil having now put into the heart
of judas iscariot the son of simon to betray him
knowing that the father had given him all things into his hands
and that he came from god and goeth to god
he riseth from supper and layeth aside his garments and having
taken a towel girded himself
after that he putteth water into a basin and began to wash the
feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was
girded
he cometh therefore to simon peter and peter saith to him lord
dost thou wash my feet
jesus answered and said to him what i do thou knowest not now
but thou shalt know hereafter
peter saith to him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered
him if i wash thee not thou shalt have no part with me
simon peter saith to him lord not only my feet but also my
hands and my head
jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not but to wash his
feet but is clean wholly and you are clean but not all
for he knew who he was that would betray him therefore he said
then after he had washed their feet and taken his garments being
set down again he said to them know you what i have done to you
you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am
if then i being your lord and master have washed your feet you
also ought to wash one anothers feet
for i have given you an example that as i have done to you so
you do also
amen amen i say to you the servant is not greater than his
lord neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him
if you know these things you shall be blessed if you do them
i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the
scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me shall lift up
his heel against me
at present i tell you before it come to pass that when it shall
come to pass you may believe that i am he
amen amen i say to you he that receiveth whomsoever i send
receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
when jesus had said these things he was troubled in spirit and
he testified and said amen amen i say to you one of you shall
betray me
the disciples therefore looked one upon another doubting of whom
he spoke
now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom
simon peter therefore beckoned to him and said to him who is it
of whom he speaketh
he therefore leaning on the breast of jesus saith to him lord
who is it
jesus answered he it is to whom i shall reach bread dipped and
when he had dipped the bread he gave it to judas iscariot the son of
and after the morsel satan entered into him and jesus said to
him that which thou dost do quickly
command to go about his treason but a signification to him that christ
would not hinder or resist what he was about do it as soon as he
pleased but was both ready and desirous to suffer for our redemption
now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto
him
for some thought because judas had the purse that jesus had
said to him buy those things which we have need of for the festival
day or that he should give something to the poor
he therefore having received the morsel went out immediately
when he therefore was gone out jesus said now is the son of man
glorified and god is glorified in him
if god be glorified in him god also will glorify him in himself
and immediately will he glorify him
little children yet a little while i am with you you shall seek
me and as i said to the jews whither i go you cannot come so i say to
you now
a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as
by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have
love one for another
simon peter saith to him lord whither goest thou jesus
answered whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt
follow hereafter
peter saith to him why cannot i follow thee now i will lay down
my life for thee
jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for me amen
amen i say to thee the cock shall not crow till thou deny me thrice
let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also
in me
in my fathers house there are many mansions if not i would have
told you because i go to prepare a place for you
and if i shall go and prepare a place for you i will come again
and will take you to myself that where i am you also may be
and whither i go you know and the way you know
thomas saith to him lord we know not whither thou goest and
how can we know the way
jesus saith to him i am the way and the truth and the life no
man cometh to the father but by me
if you had known me you would without doubt have known my father
also and from henceforth you shall know him and you have seen him
philip saith to him lord shew us the father and it is enough
for us
jesus saith to him have i been so long a time with you and have
you not known me philip he that seeth me seeth the father also how
sayest thou shew us the father
do you not believe that i am in the father and the father in me
who abideth in me he doth the works
believe you not that i am in the father and the father in me
otherwise believe for the very works sake amen amen i say to
you he that believeth in me the works that i do he also shall do and
greater than these shall he do
because i go to the father and whatsoever you shall ask the
the son
if you shall ask me any thing in my name that i will do
if you love me keep my commandments
and i will ask the father and he shall give you another
inspiring prayer he prays as it were in us and pleads for us for
ever hence it is evident that this spirit of truth was not only
promised to the persons of the apostles but also to their successors
through all generations
the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it
seeth him not nor knoweth him but you shall know him because he shall
abide with you and shall be in you
i will not leave you orphans i will come to you
yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see
me because i live and you shall live
in that day you shall know that i am in my father and you in me
and i in you
he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that
loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will
love him and will manifest myself to him
judas saith to him not the iscariot lord how is it that thou
wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world
jesus answered and said to him if any one love me he will keep
my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and will
make our abode with him
he that loveth me not keepeth not my words and the word which
you have heard is not mine but the fathers who sent me
these things have i spoken to you abiding with you
but the paraclete the holy ghost whom the father will send in
my name he will teach you all things and bring all things to your mind
whatsoever i shall have said to you
and their successors particularly in order to teach them all truth
and to preserve them from error
peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the
world giveth do i give unto you let not your heart be troubled nor
let it be afraid
you have heard that i said to you i go away and i come unto
you if you loved me you would indeed be glad because i go to the
speaks here of himself as he is made man for as god he is equal to the
these words will vanish when the relative circumstances of the text
here are considered for christ being at this time shortly to suffer
death signified to his apostles his human nature by these very words
for as god he could not die and therefore as he was both god and man
it must follow that according to his humanity he was to die which the
apostles were soon to see and believe as he expresses ver and now
you may believe
and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it
shall come to pass you may believe
i will not now speak many things with you for the prince of this
world cometh and in me he hath not any thing
but that the world may know that i love the father and as the
i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman
every branch in me that beareth not fruit he will take away and
every one that beareth fruit he will purge it that it may bring forth
more fruit
now you are clean by reason of the word which i have spoken to
you
abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself unless it abide in the vine so neither can you unless you
abide in me
i am the vine you the branches he that abideth in me and i in
him the same beareth much fruit for without me you can do nothing
if any one abide not in me he shall be cast forth as a branch and
shall wither and they shall gather him up and cast him into the fire
and he burneth
if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask
whatever you will and it shall be done unto you
in this is my father glorified that you bring forth very much
fruit and become my disciples
as the father hath loved me i also have loved you abide in my
love
if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love as i
also have kept my fathers commandments and do abide in his love
these things i have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and
your joy may be filled
this is my commandment that you love one another as i have
loved you
greater love than this no man hath that a man lay down his life
for his friends
you are my friends if you do the things that i command you
i will not now call you servants for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doth but i have called you friends because all things
whatsoever i have heard of my father i have made known to you
you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and have appointed
you that you should go and should bring forth fruit and your fruit
should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name
he may give it you
these things i command you that you love one another
if the world hate you know ye that it hath hated me before you
if you had been of the world the world would love its own but
because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the
world therefore the world hateth you
remember my word that i said to you the servant is not greater
than his master if they have persecuted me they will also persecute
you if they have kept my word they will keep yours also
but all these things they will do to you for my names sake
because they know not him that sent me
if i had not come and spoken to them they would not have sin
but now they have no excuse for their sin
he that hateth me hateth my father also
if i had not done among them the works that no other man hath
done they would not have sin but now they have both seen and hated
both me and my father
but that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law
they hated me without cause
but when the paraclete cometh whom i will send you from the
give testimony of me
otherwise he could not be sent by the son
and you shall give testimony because you are with me from the
beginning
these things have i spoken to you things have i spoken to you that
you may not be scandalized
they will put you out of the synagogues yea the hour cometh
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doth a service to god
and these things will they do to you because they have not known
the father nor me
but these things i have told you that when the hour shall come
you may remember that i told you of them
but i told you not these things from the beginning because i was
with you and now i go to him that sent me and none of you asketh me
but because i have spoken these things to you sorrow hath filled
your heart
but i tell you the truth it is expedient to you that i go for
if i go not the paraclete will not come to you but if i go i will
send him to you
and when he is come he will convince the world of sin and of
justice and of judgment
brought over many thousands first to a sense of their sin in not
believing in christ secondly to a conviction of the justice of christ
now sitting at the right hand of his father and thirdly to a right
apprehension of the judgment prepared for them that choose to follow
of sin because they believed not in me
and of justice because i go to the father and you shall see me
no longer
and of judgment because the prince of this world is already
judged
i have yet many things to say to you but you cannot bear them
now
but when he the spirit of truth is come he will teach you all
truth for he shall not speak of himself but what things soever he
shall hear he shall speak and the things that are to come he shall
shew you
he shall glorify me because he shall receive of mine and shall
shew it to you
all things whatsoever the father hath are mine therefore i said
that he shall receive of me and shew it to you
a little while and now you shall not see me and again a little
while and you shall see me because i go to the father
then some of his disciples said one to another what is this that
he saith to us a little while and you shall not see me and again a
little while and you shall see me and because i go to the father
they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while
and jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him and he said to
them of this do you inquire among yourselves because i said a little
while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall
see me
amen amen i say to you that you shall lament and weep but the
world shall rejoice and you shall be made sorrowful but your sorrow
shall be turned into joy
a woman when she is in labour hath sorrow because her hour is
come but when she hath brought forth the child she remembereth no more
the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world
so also you now indeed have sorrow but i will see you again and
your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man shall take from you
and in that day you shall not ask me any thing amen amen i say
to you if you ask the father any thing in my name he will give it you
hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name ask and you
shall receive that your joy may be full
these things i have spoken to you in proverbs the hour cometh
when i will no longer speak to you in proverbs but will shew you
plainly of the father
in that day you shall ask in my name and i say not to you that
for the father himself loveth you because you have loved me and
have believed that i came out from god
i came forth from the father and am come into the world again i
leave the world and i go to the father
his disciples say to him behold now thou speakest plainly and
speakest no proverb
now we know that thou knowest all things and thou needest not
that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth
from god
jesus answered them do you now believe
behold the hour cometh and it is now come that you shall be
scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am
not alone because the father is with me
these things i have spoken to you that in me you may have peace
overcome the world
these things jesus spoke and lifting up his eyes to heaven he
said the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son may glorify thee
as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he may give
eternal life to all whom thou hast given him
now this is eternal life that they may know thee the only true
i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which
thou gavest me to do
and now glorify thou me o father with thyself with the glory
which i had before the world was with thee
i have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out
of the world thine they were and to me thou gavest them and they have
kept thy word
now they have known that all things which thou hast given me are
from thee
because the words which thou gavest me i have given to them and
they have received them and have known in very deed that i came out from
thee and they have believed that thou didst send me
i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them whom thou
hast given me because they are thine
and all my things are thine and thine are mine and i am
glorified in them
and now i am not in the world and these are in the world and i
come to thee holy father keep them in thy name whom thou hast given
me that they may be one as we also are
while i was with them i kept them in thy name those whom thou
gavest me have i kept and none of them is lost but the son of
perdition that the scripture may be fulfilled
and now i come to thee and these things i speak in the world
that they may have my joy filled in themselves
i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them
because they are not of the world as i also am not of the world
i pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world but
that thou shouldst keep them from evil
they are not of the world as i also am not of the world
sanctify them in truth thy word is truth
as thou hast sent me into the world i also have sent them into
the world
and for them do i sanctify myself that they also may be
sanctified in truth
and not for them only do i pray but for them also who through
their word shall believe in me
that they all may be one as thou father in me and i in thee
that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou
hast sent me
and the glory which thou hast given me i have given to them
that they may be one as we also are one
i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one
and the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as
thou hast also loved me
father i will that where i am they also whom thou hast given me
may be with me that they may see my glory which thou hast given me
because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world
just father the world hath not known thee but i have known
thee and these have known that thou hast sent me
and i have made known thy name to them and will make it known
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in
them
when jesus had said these things he went forth with his disciples
over the brook cedron where there was a garden into which he entered
with his disciples
and judas also who betrayed him knew the place because jesus
had often resorted thither together with his disciples
judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants
from the chief priests and the pharisees cometh thither with lanterns
and torches and weapons
jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him
went forth and said to them whom seek ye
they answered him jesus of nazareth jesus saith to them i am
he and judas also who betrayed him stood with them
as soon therefore as he had said to them i am he they went
backward and fell to the ground
again therefore he asked them whom seek ye and they said jesus
of nazareth
jesus answered i have told you that i am he if therefore you
seek me let these go their way
that the word might be fulfilled which he said of them whom thou
hast given me i have not lost any one
then simon peter having a sword drew it and struck the servant
of the high priest and cut off his right ear and the name of thee
servant was malchus
jesus therefore said to peter put up thy sword into the
scabbard the chalice which my father hath given me shall i not drink
it
then the band and the tribune and the servants of the jews took
and they led him away to annas first for he was fatherinlaw to
now caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the jews that it
was expedient that one man should die for the people
and simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciple and
that disciple was known to the high priest and went in with jesus into
the court of the high priest
but peter stood at the door without the other disciple
therefore who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the
portress and brought in peter
the maid therefore that was portress saith to peter art not thou
also one of this mans disciple he saith i am not
now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals because
it was cold and warmed themselves and with them was peter also
standing and warming himself
the high priest therefore asked jesus of his disciples and of his
doctrine
jesus answered him i have spoken openly to the world i have
always taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither all the jews
resort and in secret i have spoken nothing
why askest thou me ask them who have heard what i have spoken
unto them behold they know what things i have said
and when he had said these things one of the servants standing
by gave jesus a blow saying answerest thou the high priest so
jesus answered him if i have spoken evil give testimony of the
evil but if well why strikest thou me
and annas sent him bound to caiphas the high priest
and simon peter was standing and warming himself they said
therefore to him art not thou also one of his disciples he denied it
and said i am not
one of the servants of the high priest a kinsman to him whose
ear peter cut off saith to him did not i see thee in the garden with
him
again therefore peter denied and immediately the cock crew
then they led jesus from caiphas to the governors hall and it
was morning and they went not into the hall that they might not be
defiled but that they might eat the pasch
pilate therefore went out to them and said what accusation
bring you against this man
they answered and said to him if he were not a malefactor we
would not have delivered him up to thee
pilate therefore said to them take him you and judge him
according to your law the jews therefore said to him it is not lawful
for us to put any man to death
that the word of jesus might be fulfilled which he said
signifying what death he should die
pilate therefore went into the hall again and called jesus and
said to him art thou the king of the jews
jesus answered sayest thou this thing of thyself or have others
told it thee of me
pilate answered am i a jew thy own nation and the chief priests
have delivered thee up to me what hast thou done
jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom
were of this world my servants would certainly strive that i should not
be delivered to the jews but now my kingdom is not from hence
pilate therefore said to him art thou a king then jesus
answered thou sayest that i am a king for this was i born and for
this came i into the world that i should give testimony to the truth
pilate saith to him what is truth and when he said this he
went out again to the jews and saith to them i find no cause in him
but you have a custom that i should release one unto you at the
then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas
then therefore pilate took jesus and scourged him
and the soldiers platting a crown of thorns put it upon his head
and they put on him a purple garment
and they came to him and said hail king of the jews and they
gave him blows
pilate therefore went forth again and saith to them behold i
bring him forth unto you that you may know that i find no cause in him
jesus therefore came forth bearing the crown of thorns and the
purple garment and he saith to them behold the man
when the chief priests therefore and the servants had seen him
they cried out saying crucify him crucify him pilate saith to them
the jews answered him we have a law and according to the law he
ought to die because he made himself the son of god
when pilate therefore had heard this saying he feared the more
and he entered into the hall again and he said to jesus whence
art thou but jesus gave him no answer
pilate therefore saith to him speakest thou not to me knowest
thou not that i have power to crucify thee and i have power to release
thee
jesus answered thou shouldst not have any power against me
unless it were given thee from above therefore he that hath delivered
me to thee hath the greater sin
and from henceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews
cried out saying if thou release this man thou art not caesars
friend for whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar
now when pilate had heard these words he brought jesus forth and
sat down in the judgment seat in the place that is called lithostrotos
and in hebrew gabbatha
and it was the parasceve of the pasch about the sixth hour and
he saith to the jews behold your king
sabbath the eve of every sabbath was called the parasceve or day of
preparation but this was the eve of a high sabbath viz that which
fell in the paschal week
but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him
answered we have no king but caesar
then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified and
they took jesus and led him forth
and bearing his own cross he went forth to the place which is
called calvary but in hebrew golgotha
where they crucified him and with him two others one on each
side and jesus in the midst
and pilate wrote a title also and he put it upon the cross and
the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews
this title therefore many of the jews did read because the place
where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in
then the chief priests of the jews said to pilate write not the
pilate answered what i have written i have written
the soldiers therefore when they had crucified him took his
garments and they made four parts to every soldier a part and also
his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout
they said then one to another let us not cut it but let us cast
lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled
saying they have parted my garments among them and upon my vesture
they have cast lots and the soldiers indeed did these things
now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his
mothers sister mary of cleophas and mary magdalen
when jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple
standing whom he loved he saith to his mother woman behold thy son
after that he saith to the disciple behold thy mother and
from that hour the disciple took her to his own
afterwards jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished
that the scripture might be fulfilled said i thirst
now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar and they
putting a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop put it to his mouth
jesus therefore when he had taken the vinegar said it is
consummated and bowing his head he gave up the ghost
then the jews because it was the parasceve that the bodies
might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that was a great
sabbath day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that
they might be taken away
the soldiers therefore came and they broke the legs of the
first and of the other that was crucified with him
but after they were come to jesus when they saw that he was
already dead they did not break his legs
but one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side and
immediately there came out blood and water
and he that saw it hath given testimony and his testimony is
true and he knoweth that he saith true that you also may believe
for these things were done that the scripture might be fulfilled
and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom
they pierced
and after these things joseph of arimathea because he was a
disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate
that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave leave he
came therefore and took away the body of jesus
and nicodemus also came he who at the first came to jesus by
night bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound
weight
they took therefore the body of jesus and bound it in linen
cloths with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury
now there was in the place where he was crucified a garden and
in the garden a new sepulchre wherein no man yet had been laid
there therefore because of the parasceve of the jews they laid
and on the first day of the week mary magdalen cometh early when
it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and she saw the stone taken away
from the sepulchre
she ran therefore and cometh to simon peter and to the other
disciple whom jesus loved and saith to them they have taken away the
peter therefore went out and the other disciple and they came to
the sepulchre
and they both ran together and that other disciple did outrun
and when he stooped down he saw the linen cloths lying but yet
he went not in
then cometh simon peter following him and went into the
sepulchre and saw the linen cloths lying
and the napkin that had been about his head not lying with the
linen cloths but apart wrapped up into one place
then that other disciple also went in who came first to the
sepulchre and he saw and believed
for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again
from the dead
the disciples therefore departed again to their home
but mary stood at the sepulchre without weeping now as she was
weeping she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre
and she saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and
one at the feet where the body of jesus had been laid
they say to her woman why weepest thou she saith to them
laid him
when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus
standing and she knew not that it was jesus
jesus saith to her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou
taken him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him
away
jesus saith to her mary she turning saith to him rabboni
which is to say master
jesus saith to her do not touch me for i am not yet ascended to
my father but go to my brethren and say to them i ascend to my father
and to your father to my god and to your god
mary magdalen cometh and telleth the disciples i have seen the
now when it was late the same day the first of the week and the
doors were shut where the disciples were gathered together for fear of
the jews jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them peace be
to you
body entire in all its dimensions through the doors can without the
least question make the same body really present in the sacrament
though both the one and the other be above our comprehension
and when he had said this he shewed them his hands and his side
he said therefore to them again peace be to you as the father
hath sent me i also send you
when he had said this he breathed on them and he said to them
whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them and whose
sins you shall retain they are retained
heaven by virtue of which the pastors of christs church absolve
repenting sinners upon their confession
now thomas one of the twelve who is called didymus was not
with them when jesus came
the other disciples therefore said to him we have seen the lord
nails and put my finger into the place of the nails and put my hand into
his side i will not believe
and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas
with them jesus cometh the doors being shut and stood in the midst
and said peace be to you
then he said to thomas put in thy finger hither and see my
hands and bring hither the hand and put it into my side and be not
faithless but believing
thomas answered and said to him my lord and my god
jesus saith to him because thou hast seen me thomas thou hast
believed blessed are they that have not seen and have believed
many other signs also did jesus in the sight of his disciples
which are not written in this book
but these are written that you may believe that jesus is the
name
after this jesus shewed himself to the disciples at the sea of
there were together simon peter and thomas who is called
simon peter saith to them i go a fishing they say to him we
also come with thee and they went forth and entered into the ship and
that night they caught nothing
but when the morning was come jesus stood on the shore yet the
disciples knew not that it was jesus
jesus therefore said to them children have you any meat they
answered him no
he saith to them cast the net on the right side of the ship and
you shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw
it for the multitude of fishes
that disciple therefore whom jesus loved said to peter it is the
about him for he was naked and cast himself into the sea
but the other disciples came in the ship for they were not far
from the land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with
fishes
as soon then as they came to land they saw hot coals lying and a
fish laid thereon and bread
jesus saith to them bring hither of the fishes which you have
now caught
simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great
fishes one hundred and fiftythree and although there were so many
the net was not broken
jesus saith to them come and dine and none of them who were at
meat durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord
and jesus cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish in
like manner
this is now the third time that jesus was manifested to his
disciples after he was risen from the dead
when therefore they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon
son of john lovest thou me more than these he saith to him yea lord
thou knowest that i love thee he saith to him feed my lambs
he saith to him again simon son of john lovest thou me he
saith to him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith to him
he said to him the third time simon son of john lovest thou
me peter was grieved because he had said to him the third time lovest
thou me and he said to him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest
that i love thee he said to him feed my sheep
him with the superintendency of all his sheep without exception and
consequently of his whole flock that is of his own church
amen amen i say to thee when thou wast younger thou didst
gird thyself and didst walk where thou wouldst but when thou shalt be
old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and
lead thee whither thou wouldst not
and this he said signifying by what death he should glorify god
peter turning about saw that disciple whom jesus loved
following who also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord who
is he that shall betray thee
him therefore when peter had seen he saith to jesus lord and
what shall this man do
jesus saith to him so i will have him to remain till i come
what is it to thee follow thou me
this saying therefore went abroad among the brethren that that
disciple should not die and jesus did not say to him he should not
die but so i will have him to remain till i come what is it to thee
this is that disciple who giveth testimony of these things and
hath written these things and we know that his testimony is true
but there are also many other things which jesus did which if
they were written every one the world itself i think would not be
able to contain the books that should be written
the apostles who were dispersed into different nations but only a
short view of the first establishment of the christian church a part of
the preaching and action of st peter are related in the first twelve
chapters and a particular account of st pauls apostolical labours in
the subsequent chapters it was written by st luke the evangelist and
the original in greek its history commences from the ascension of
of the church for the space of about thirty years
eternal to the end that we may have fellowship with god and all good
through him yet so if we confess our sins
that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we
have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have
handled of the word of life
for the life was manifested and we have seen and do bear witness
and declare unto you the life eternal which was with the father and
hath appeared to us
that which we have seen and have heard we declare unto you that
you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship may be with the
and these things we write to you that you may rejoice and your joy
may be full
and this is the declaration which we have heard from him and
declare unto you that god is light and in him there is no darkness
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we
lie and do not the truth
but if we walk in the light as he also is in the light we have
fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son
cleanseth us from all sin
if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
is not in us
if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity
if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his
word is not in us
another we must not love the world nor give ear to new teachers but
abide by the spirit of god in the church
my little children these things i write to you that you may not
sin but if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus
and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only
but also for those of the whole world
and by this we know that we have known him if we keep his
commandments
practical knowledge by love and affection which can only be proved by
our keeping his commandments and without which we can not be said to
know god as we should do
he who saith that he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments
is a liar and the truth is not in him
but he that keepeth his word in him in very deed the charity of
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as
he walked
dearly beloved i write not a new commandment to you but an old
commandment which you had from the beginning the old commandment is the
word which you have heard
again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true both
in him and in you because the darkness is passed and the true light now
shineth
given in the old law but was renewed and extended by christ see john

he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in
darkness even until now
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is no
scandal in him
but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in
darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because the darkness hath
blinded his eyes
i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven
you for his names sake
i write unto you fathers because you have known him who is from
the beginning i write unto you young men because you have overcome
the wicked one
i write unto you babes because you have known the father i
write unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god
abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one
love not the world nor the things which are in the world if any
man love the world the charity of the father is not in him
for all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and
the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life which is not of the
and the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof but he
that doth the will of god abideth for ever
little children it is the last hour and as you have heard that
we know that it is the last hour
church and forerunners of the great antichrist
they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had
been of us they would no doubt have remained with us but that they may
be manifest that they are not all of us
but you have the unction from the holy one and know all things
in unity under the guidance of their lawful pastors partake of the
grace of the holy ghost promised to the church and her pastors and
have in the church all necessary knowledge and instruction so as to
have no need to seek it elsewhere since it can be only found in that
society of which they are members
i have not written to you as to them that know not the truth but
as to them that know it and that no lie is of the truth
who is a liar but he who denieth that jesus is the christ this
is antichrist who denieth the father and the son
whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father he that
confesseth the son hath the father also
as for you let that which you have heard from the beginning abide
in you if that abide in you which you have heard from the beginning
you also shall abide in the son and in the father
and this is the promise which he hath promised us life
everlasting
these things have i written to you concerning them that seduce
you
and as for you let the unction which you have received from him
abide in you and you have no need that any man teach you but as his
unction teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and as it
hath taught you abide in him
who under pretence of imparting more knowledge to you seek to seduce
you ver since you are sufficiently taught already and have all
knowledge and grace in the church with the unction of the holy ghost
which these new teachers have no share in
and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear
we may have confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming
if you know that he is just know ye that every one also who doth
justice is born of him
those of the devil of loving one another and of purity of conscience
behold what manner of charity the father hath bestowed upon us
that we should be called and should be the sons of god therefore the
world knoweth not us because it knew not him
dearly beloved we are now the sons of god and it hath not yet
appeared what we shall be we know that when he shall appear we shall be
like to him because we shall see him as he is
and every one that hath this hope in him sanctifieth himself as he
also is holy
whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity and sin is
iniquity
and you know that he appeared to take away our sins and in him
there is no sin
whosoever abideth in him sinneth not and whosoever sinneth hath
not seen him nor known him
little children let no man deceive you he that doth justice is
just even as he is just
he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from
the beginning for this purpose the son of god appeared that he might
destroy the works of the devil
whosoever is born of god committeth not sin for his seed abideth
in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god
seed of grace and this divine generation by which he is born of god
will as appears from rom cor and phil
in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the
devil whosoever is not just is not of god or he that loveth not his
brother
for this is the declaration which you have heard from the
beginning that you should love one another
not as cain who was of the wicked one and killed his brother
his brothers just
wonder not brethren if the world hate you
we know that we have passed from death to life because we love
the brethren he that loveth not abideth in death
whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself
in this we have known the charity of god because he hath laid
down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the
brethren
he that hath the substance of this world and shall see his brother
in need and shall shut up his bowels from him how doth the charity of
my little children let us not love in word nor in tongue but in
deed and in truth
in this we know that we are of the truth and in his sight shall
persuade our hearts
for if our heart reprehend us god is greater than our heart and
knoweth all things
dearly beloved if our heart do not reprehend us we have
confidence towards god
and whatsoever we shall ask we shall receive of him because we
keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his
sight
and this is his commandment that we should believe in the name of
his son jesus christ and love one another as he hath given commandment
unto us
and he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him and he in
him and in this we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he
hath given us
because god has loved us
dearly beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits if
they be of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
agreeable to the rule of the catholic faith and the doctrine of the
church for as he says ver he that knoweth god heareth us the
pastors of the church by this we know the spirit of truth and the
spirit of error
by this is the spirit of god known every spirit which confesseth
that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god
point of faith alone is at all times and in all cases sufficient
but that with relation to that time and for that part of the christian
doctrine which was then particularly to be confessed taught and
maintained against the heretics of those days this was the most proper
token by which the true teachers might be distinguished form the false
and every spirit that dissolveth jesus is not of god and this is
in the world
divinity he is now already in the world not in his person but in
his spirit and in his precursors
you are of god little children and have overcome him because
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world
they are of the world therefore of the world they speak and the
world heareth them
we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of
of error
dearly beloved let us love one another for charity is of god and
every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god
he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is charity
by this hath the charity of god appeared towards us because god
hath sent his only begotten son into the world that we may live by him
in this is charity not as though we had loved god but because he
hath first loved us and sent his son to be a propitiation for our sins
my dearest if god hath so loved us we also ought to love one
another
no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god
abideth in us and his charity is perfected in us
in this we know that we abide in him and he in us because he
hath given us of his spirit
and we have seen and do testify that the father hath sent his son
to be the saviour of the world
whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god abideth
in him and he in god
and we have known and have believed the charity which god hath to
us god is charity and he that abideth in charity abideth in god and
in this is the charity of god perfected with us that we may have
confidence in the day of judgment because as he is we also are in this
world
fear is not in charity but perfect charity casteth out fear
because fear hath sin and he that feareth is not perfected in charity
fear that is the fear of men as also all perplexing fear which makes
men mistrust or despair of gods mercy and that kind of servile fear
which makes them fear the punishment of sin more than the offence
offered to god but it no way excludes the wholesome fear of gods
judgments so often recomended in holy writ nor that fear and
trembling with which we are told to work out our salvation phil
let us therefore love god because god first hath loved us
if any man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar
whom he seeth not
and this commandment we have from god that he who loveth god love
also his brother
world three that bear witness to christ of faith in his name and of
sin that is and is not to death
whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and
every one that loveth him who begot loveth him also who is born of him
baptism which is also to be understood provided the belief of this
fundamental article of the christian faith be accompanied with all the
other conditions which by the word of god and his appointment are
also required to justification such as a general belief of all that god
has revealed and promised hope love repentance and a sincere
disposition to keep gods holy law and commandments
in this we know that we love the children of god when we love god
and keep his commandments
for this is the charity of god that we keep his commandments and
his commandments are not heavy
for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the
victory which overcameth the world our faith
worketh by charity gal
who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that
this is he that came by water and blood jesus christ not by water
only but by water and blood and it is the spirit which testifieth that
of baptism but by his own blood
and there are three who give testimony in heaven the father the
and there are three that give testimony on earth the spirit and
the water and the blood and these three are one
the holy ghost all bear witness to christs divinity so the spirit
which he yielded up crying out with a loud voice upon the cross and
the water and blood that issued from his side bear witness to his
humanity and are one that is all agree in one testimony
if we receive the testimony of men the testimony of god is
greater for this is the testimony of god which is greater because he
hath testified of his son
he that believeth in the son of god hath the testimony of god in
himself he that believeth not the son maketh him a liar because he
believeth not in the testimony which god hath testified of his son
testimonies given by the three divine persons that jesus was the
promised to all that comply with his doctrine in him we have also this
lively confidence that we shall obtain whatever we ask according to
his will when we ask what is for our good with perseverance and in
the manner we ought and this we know and have experience of by having
obtained the petitions that we have made
and this is the testimony that god hath given to us eternal life
he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son hath not
life
these things i write to you that you may know that you have
eternal life you who believe in the name of the son of god
and this is the confidence which we have towards him that
whatsoever we shall ask according to his will he heareth us
and we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask we know that we
have the petitions which we request of him
he that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death
let him ask and life shall be given to him who sinneth not to death
death the difference can not be the same as betwixt sins that are
called venial and mortal for he says that if a man pray for his
brother who commits a sin that is not to death life shall be given
him therefore such a one had before lost the life of grace and been
guilty of what is commonly called a mortal sin and when he speaks of a
sin that is unto death and adds these words for that i say not that
any man ask it cannot be supposed that st john would say this of every
mortal sin but only of some heinous sins which are very seldom
remitted because such sinners very seldom repent by a sin therefore
which is unto death interpreters commonly understand a wilfull apostasy
from the faith and from the known truth when a sinner hardened by his
own ingratitude becomes deaf to all admonitions will do nothing for
himself but runs on to a final impenitence nor yet does st john say
that such a sin is never remitted or cannnot be remitted but only has
these words for that i say not that any man ask the remission that
is though we must pray for all sinners whatsoever yet men can not pray
for such sinners with such a confidence of obtaining always their
petitions as st john said before ver whatever exposition we
follow on this verse our faith teacheth us from the holy scriptures
that god desires not the death of any sinner but that he be converted
and live ezech though mens sins be as red as scarlet they
shall become as white as snow isa it is the will of god that
every one come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved there is no
sin so great but which god is willing to forgive and has left a power
in his church to remit the most enormous sins so that no sinner need
despair of pardon nor will any sinner perist but by his own fault a
sin unto death some understand this of final impenitence or of dying
in mortal sin which is the only sin that never can be remitted but it
is probable he may also comprise under this name the sin of apostasy
from the faith and some other such heinous sins as are seldom and
hardly remitted and therefore he gives little encouragement to such as
pray for these sinners to expect what they ask
all iniquity is sin and there is a sin unto death
we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but the
generation of god preserveth him and the wicked one toucheth him not
we know that we are of god and the whole world is seated in
wickedness
the world it may also signify is under the wicked one meaning the
devil who is elsewhere called the prince of this world that is of all
the wicked john
and we know that the son of god is come and he hath given us
understanding that we may know the true god and may be in his true son
eternal which words are a clear proof of christs divinity and as
such made use of by the ancient fathers
little children keep yourselves from idols amen
back into the sin of idolatry which may be the sin unto death here
mentioned by st john
the true faith and exhorts them to persevere lest they lose the reward
of their labours he exhorts them to love one another but with heretics
to have no society even not to salute them although this epistle is
written to a particular person yet its instructions may serve as a
lesson to others especially to those who from their connections
situation or condition in life are in danger of perversion
false teachers
the ancient to the lady elect and her children whom i love in the
truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth
of the twelve apostles then living to the lady elect some
conjecture that electa might be the name of a family or of a particular
church but the general opinion is that it is the proper name of a
lady so eminent for her piety and great charity as to merit this
for the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us and shall be with us
for ever
grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from
i was exceeding glad that i found of thy children walking in truth
as we have received a commandment from the father
and now i beseech thee lady not as writing a new commandment to
thee but that which we have had from the beginning that we love one
another
and this is charity that we walk according to his commandments
you should walk in the same
for many seducers are gone out into the world who confess not that
look to yourselves that you lose not the things which you have
wrought but that you may receive a full reward
whosoever revolteth and continueth not in the doctrine of christ
hath not god he that continueth in the doctrine the same hath both the
if any man come to you and bring not this doctrine receive him
not into the house nor say to him god speed you
forewarn the faithful of the dangers which may arise from a familiarity
with those who have prevaricated and gone from the true faith and with
such as teach false doctrine but this is not forbidding a charity for
all men by which we ought to wish and pray for the eternal salvation of
every one even of our enemies
for he that saith unto him god speed you communicateth with his
wicked works
having more things to write unto you i would not by paper and
ink for i hope that i shall be with you and speak face to face that
your joy may be full
the children of thy sister elect salute thee
complains of the bad conduct of diotrephes and gives a good testimony to
the ancient to the dearly beloved gaius whom i love in truth
dearly beloved concerning all things i make it my prayer that thou
mayest proceed prosperously and fare well as thy soul doth
prosperously
i was exceedingly glad when the brethren came and gave testimony to
the truth in thee even as thou walkest in the truth
i have no greater grace than this to hear that my children walk in
truth
satisfaction
dearly beloved thou dost faithfully whatever thou dost for the
brethren and that for strangers
who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the church
of god
because for his name they went out taking nothing of the
commended by st john who took nothing from the gentiles lest they
should seem to preach in order to get money by it
we therefore ought to receive such that we may be fellow helpers
of the truth
i had written perhaps to the church but diotrephes who loveth to
have the preeminence among them doth not receive us
for this cause if i come i will advertise his works which he
doth with malicious words prating against us and as if these things
were not enough for him neither doth he himself receive the brethren
and them that do receive them he forbiddeth and casteth out of the
church
friend to the faithful therefore this part of the letter might be an
admonition to him from the apostle
dearly beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is
good he that doth good is of god he that doth evil hath not seen god
to demetrius testimony is given by all and by the truth itself
yea and we also give testimony and thou knowest that our testimony is
true
i had many things to write unto thee but i would not by ink and
pen write to thee
but i hope speedily to see thee and we will speak mouth to mouth
brother to st james the less the time it was written is uncertain
only it may be inferred from verse that few or none of the apostles
were then living except st john he inveighs against the heresies and
wicked practices of the simonians nicolaites and gnostics etc
describing them and their leaders by strong epithets and similes he
exhorts the faithful to contend earnestly for the faith first delivered
to them and to beware of heretics
