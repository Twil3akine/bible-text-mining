saved by preaching of the cross and not by human wisdom or eloquence
paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god
and sosthenes a brother
to the church of god that is at corinth to them that are
sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints with all that invoke
the name of our lord jesus christ in every place of theirs and ours
grace to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus
i give thanks to my god always for you for the grace of god that
is given you in christ jesus
that in all things you are made rich in him in all utterance and
in all knowledge
as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you
so that nothing is wanting to you in any grace waiting for the
manifestation of our lord jesus christ
who also will confirm you unto the end without crime in the days
of the coming of our lord jesus christ
god is faithful by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his
now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ
that you all speak the same thing and that there be no schisms among
you but that you be perfect in the same mind and in the same judgment
for it hath been signified unto me my brethren of you by them
that are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you
now this i say that every one of you saith i indeed am of paul
and i am of apollo and i of cephas and i of christ
is christ divided was paul then crucified for you or were you
baptized in the name of paul
i give god thanks that i baptized none of you but crispus and
lest any should say that you were baptized in my name
and i baptized also the household of stephanus besides i know
not whether i baptized any other
for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not
in wisdom of speech lest the cross of christ should be made void
for the word of the cross to them indeed that perish is
foolishness but to them that are saved that is to us it is the power
of god
for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the
prudence of the prudent i will reject
where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of
this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world
for seeing that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew
not god it pleased god by the foolishness of our preaching to save
them that believe
for both the jews require signs and the greeks seek after wisdom
but we preach christ crucified unto the jews indeed a
stumblingblock and unto the gentiles foolishness
but unto them that are called both jews and greeks christ the
power of god and the wisdom of god
for the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of
world in the ways of god is indeed most wise and what appears weak is
indeed above all the strength and comprehension of man
for see your vocation brethren that there are not many wise
according to the flesh not many mighty not many noble
but the foolish things of the world hath god chosen that he may
confound the wise and the weak things of the world hath god chosen
that he may confound the strong
and the base things of the world and the things that are
contemptible hath god chosen and things that are not that he might
bring to nought things that are
that no flesh should glory in his sight
but of him are you in christ jesus who of god is made unto us
wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption
that as it is written he that glorieth may glory in the lord
sensual man but only by the spiritual man
and i brethren when i came to you came not in loftiness of
speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of christ
for i judged not myself to know anything among you but jesus
and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling
and my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of
human wisdom but in shewing of the spirit and power
that your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men but on the
power of god
howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect yet not the wisdom of
this world neither of the princes of this world that come to nought
but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery a wisdom which is
hidden which god ordained before the world unto our glory
which none of the princes of this world knew for if they had known
it they would never have crucified the lord of glory
but as it is written that eye hath not seen nor ear heard
neither hath it entered into the heart of man what things god hath
prepared for them that love him
but to us god hath revealed them by his spirit for the spirit
searcheth all things yea the deep things of god
for what man knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of a man
that is in him so the things also that are of god no man knoweth but
the spirit of god
now we have received not the spirit of this world but the spirit
that is of god that we may know the things that are given us from god
which things also we speak not in the learned words of human
wisdom but in the doctrine of the spirit comparing spiritual things
with spiritual
but the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the
because it is spiritually examined
is taken up with sensual pleasures with carnal and worldly affections
or he who measureth divine mysteries by natural reason sense and human
wisdom only now such a man has little or no notion of the things of
takes not human sense for his guide but submits his judgment to the
decisions of the church which he is commanded to hear and obey for
and to direct her in all things by the spirit of truth
but the spiritual man judgeth all things and he himself is judged
of no man
for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him
and accountable to him their works shall be tried by fire
and i brethren could not speak to you as unto spiritual but as
unto carnal as unto little ones in christ
i gave you milk to drink not meat for you were not able as yet
for whereas there is among you envying and contention are you not
carnal and walk you not according to man
for while one saith i indeed am of paul and another i am of
the ministers of him whom you have believed and to every one as
the lord hath given
i have planted apollo watered but god gave the increase
therefore neither he that planteth is any thing nor he that
watereth but god that giveth the increase
now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man
shall receive his own reward according to his own labour
for we are gods coadjutors you are gods husbandry you are gods
building
according to the grace of god that is given to me as a wise
architect i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but
let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon
for other foundation no man can lay but that which is laid which
is christ jesus
now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious
stones wood hay stubble
the true faith in him working through charity the building upon this
foundation gold silver and precious stones signifies the more perfect
preaching and practice of the gospel the wood hay and stubble such
preaching as that of the corinthian teachers who affected the pomp of
words and human eloquence and such practice as is mixed with much
imperfection and many lesser sins now the day of the lord and his
fiery trial in the particular judgment immediately after death shall
make manifest of what sort every mans work has been of which during
this life it is hard to make a judgment for then the fire of gods
judgment shall try every mans work and they whose works like wood
hay and stubble cannot abide the fire shall suffer loss these works
being found to be of no value yet they themselves having built upon
the right foundation by living and dying in the true faith and in the
state of grace though with some imperfection shall be saved yet so as
by fire being liable to this punishment by reason of the wood hay
and stubble which was mixed with their building
every mans work shall be manifest for the day of the lord shall
declare it because it shall be revealed in fire and the fire shall try
every mans work of what sort it is
if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall
receive a reward
if any mans work burn he shall suffer loss but he himself shall
be saved yet so as by fire
know you not that you are the temple of god and that the spirit of
but if any man violate the temple of god him shall god destroy
let no man deceive himself if any man among you seem to be wise
in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is
written i will catch the wise in their own craftiness
and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they
are vain
let no man therefore glory in men
for all things are yours whether it be paul or apollo or cephas
or the world or life or death or things present or things to come
and you are christs and christ is gods
their preachers and describes the treatment the apostles every where met
with
let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and the
dispensers of the mysteries of god
here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found
faithful
but to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by mans
day but neither do i judge my own self
for i am not conscious to myself of anything yet am i not hereby
justified but he that judgeth me is the lord
therefore judge not before the time until the lord come who both
will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest
the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise from
but these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to
myself and to apollo for your sakes that in us you may learn that one
be not puffed up against the other for another above that which is
written
for who distinguisheth thee or what hast thou that thou hast not
received and if thou hast received why dost thou glory as if thou
hadst not received it
you are now full you are now become rich you reign without us
and i would to god you did reign that we also might reign with you
for i think that god hath set forth us apostles the last as it
were men appointed to death we are made a spectacle to the world and to
angels and to men
we are fools for christs sake but you are wise in christ we are
weak but you are strong you are honourable but we without honour
even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and
are buffeted and have no fixed abode
and we labour working with our own hands we are reviled and we
bless we are persecuted and we suffer it
we are blasphemed and we entreat we are made as the refuse of
this world the offscouring of all even until now
i write not these things to confound you but i admonish you as my
dearest children
for if you have ten thousand instructors in christ yet not many
fathers for in christ jesus by the gospel i have begotten you
wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me as i also am of
for this cause have i sent to you timothy who is my dearest son
and faithful in the lord who will put you in mind of my ways which are
in christ jesus as i teach every where in every church
as if i would not come to you so some are puffed up
but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know
not the speech of them that are puffed up but the power
for the kingdom of god is not in speech but in power
what will you shall i come to you with a rod or in charity and
in the spirit of meekness
out the old leaven
it is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and such
fornication as the like is not among the heathens that one should have
his fathers wife
and you are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he might be
taken away from among you that hath done this thing
i indeed absent in body but present in spirit have already
judged as though i were present him that hath so done
in the name of our lord jesus christ you being gathered together
and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus
to deliver such a one to satan for the destruction of the flesh
that the spirit may be saved in the day of our lord jesus christ
your glorying is not good know you not that a little leaven
corrupteth the whole lump
purge out the old leaven that you may be a new paste as you are
unleavened for christ our pasch is sacrificed
therefore let us feast not with the old leaven nor with the
leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth
i wrote to you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators
i mean not with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous
or the extortioners or the servers of idols otherwise you must needs go
out of this world
but now i have written to you not to keep company if any man
that is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of idols
or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one not so
much as to eat
for what have i to do to judge them that are without do not you
judge them that are within
for them that are without god will judge put away the evil one
from among yourselves
from the kingdom of heaven the evil of fornication
dare any of you having a matter against another go to be judged
before the unjust and not before the saints
know you not that the saints shall judge this world and if the
world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest
matters
know you not that we shall judge angels how much more things of
this world
if therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world
set them to judge who are the most despised in the church
i speak to your shame is it so that there is not among you any one
wise man that is able to judge between his brethren
but brother goeth to law with brother and that before unbelievers
already indeed there is plainly a fault among you that you have
law suits one with another why do you not rather take wrong why do you
not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded
or the other and oftentimes on both sides
but you do wrong and defraud and that to your brethren
know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of god
nor the effeminate nor liers with mankind nor thieves nor covetous
nor drunkards nor railers nor extortioners shall possess the kingdom of
and such some of you were but you are washed but you are
sanctified but you are justified in the name of our lord jesus christ
and the spirit of our god
all things are lawful to me but all things are not expedient all
things are lawful to me but i will not be brought under the power of
any
lawful inasmuch as they are not prohibited but oftentimes they are not
expedient as in the case of lawsuits etc and much less would it be
expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing how
indifferent soever
meat for the belly and the belly for the meats but god shall
destroy both it and them but the body is not for fornication but for
the lord and the lord for the body
now god hath raised up the lord and will raise us up also by his
power
know you not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i
then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot
or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one
body for they shall be saith he two in one flesh
but he who is joined to the lord is one spirit
fly fornication every sin that a man doth is without the body
but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body
or know you not that your members are the temple of the holy
for you are bought with a great price glorify and bear god in
your body
married state
now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me it is good for a
man not to touch a woman
but for fear of fornication let every man have his own wife and
let every woman have her own husband
meaning is not to exhort the unmarried to marry on the contrary he
would have them rather continue as they are ver but he speaks
here to them that are already married who must not depart from one
another but live together as they ought to do in the marriage state
let the husband render the debt to his wife and the wife also in
like manner to the husband
the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and in
like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body but the
wife
defraud not one another except perhaps by consent for a time
that you may give yourselves to prayer and return together again lest
but i speak this by indulgence not by commandment
for i would that all men were even as myself but every one hath
his proper gift from god one after this manner and another after that
but i say to the unmarried and to the widows it is good for them
if they so continue even as i
but if they do not contain themselves let them marry for it is
better to marry than to be burnt
not of such as by vow have given their first faith to god to whom if
they will use proper means to obtain it god will never refuse the gift
of continency some translators have corrupted this text by rendering
it if they cannot contain
but to them that are married not i but the lord commandeth that
the wife depart not from her husband
and if she depart that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to
her husband and let not the husband put away his wife
for to the rest i speak not the lord if any brother hath a wife
that believeth not and she consent to dwell with him let him not put
her away
and if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent
to dwell with her let her not put away her husband
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife
and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband
the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving party or their
children in the state of grace and salvation but that it is very often
an occasion of their sanctification by bringing them to the true faith
but if the unbeliever depart let him depart for a brother or
sister is not under servitude in such cases but god hath called us in
peace
for how knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband
but as the lord hath distributed to every one as god hath called
every one so let him walk and so in all churches i teach
is any man called being circumcised let him not procure
uncircumcision is any man called in uncircumcision let him not be
circumcised
circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the
observance of the commandments of god
let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called
wast thou called being a bondman care not for it but if thou
mayest be made free use it rather
for he that is called in the lord being a bondman is the freeman
of the lord likewise he that is called being free is the bondman of
you are bought with a price be not made the bondslaves of men
brethren let every man wherein he was called therein abide with
now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord but i
give counsel as having obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful
i think therefore that this is good for the present necessity
that it is good for a man so to be
art thou bound to a wife seek not to be loosed art thou loosed
from a wife seek not a wife
but if thou take a wife thou hast not sinned and if a virgin
marry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have tribulation of
the flesh but i spare you
this therefore i say brethren the time is short it remaineth
that they also who have wives be as if they had none
and they that weep as though they wept not and they that
rejoice as if they rejoiced not and they that buy as if they possessed
not
and they that use this world as if they used it not for the
fashion of this world passeth away
but i would have you to be without solicitude he that is without
a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the lord how he may
please god
but he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the
world how he may please his wife and he is divided
and the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of
the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that
is married thinketh on the things of the world how she may please her
husband
and this i speak for your profit not to cast a snare upon you
but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon
the lord without impediment
but if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to
his virgin for that she is above the age and it must so be let him do
what he will he sinneth not if she marry
libertines would have it that persons may do what they will and not
sin provided they afterwards marry but that the father with regard to
the giving his virgin in marriage may do as he pleaseth and that it
will be no sin to him if she marry
for he that hath determined being steadfast in his heart having
no necessity but having power of his own will and hath judged this in
his heart to keep his virgin doth well
therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well
and he that giveth her not doth better
a woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if
her husband die she is at liberty let her marry to whom she will only
in the lord
but more blessed shall she be if she so remain according to my
counsel and i think that i also have the spirit of god
eaten for fear of scandal
now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols we know
we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth
serveth only to puff persons up
and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he hath not yet
known as he ought to know
but if any man love god the same is known by him
but as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols we know that an
idol is nothing in the world and that there is no god but one
for although there be that are called gods either in heaven or on
earth for there be gods many and lords many
yet to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things
and we unto him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and
we by him
but there is not knowledge in every one for some until this
present with conscience of the idol eat as a thing sacrificed to an
idol and their conscience being weak is defiled
but meat doth not commend us to god for neither if we eat shall
we have the more nor if we eat not shall we have the less
but take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a
stumblingblock to the weak
for if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idols
temple shall not his conscience being weak be emboldened to eat those
things which are sacrificed to idols
and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom
now when you sin thus against the brethren and wound their weak
conscience you sin against christ
wherefore if meat scandalize my brother i will never eat flesh
lest i should scandalize my brother
charges of those to whom he preached that he might give no hindrance to
the gospel of running in the race and striving for the mastery
am i not i free am not i an apostle have not i seen christ jesus
our lord are not you my work in the lord
and if unto others i be not an apostle but yet to you i am for
you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord
my defence with them that do examine me is this
have not we power to eat and to drink
have we not power to carry about a woman a sister as well as the
rest of the apostles and the brethren of the lord and cephas
by rendering it a sister a wife whereas it is certain st paul had
no wife chap ver and that he only speaks of such devout
women as according to the custom of the jewish nation waited upon the
preachers of the gospel and supplied them with necessaries
or i only and barnabas have not we power to do this
who serveth as a soldier at any time at his own charges who
planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof who feedeth
the flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock
speak i these things according to man or doth not the law also
say these things
for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the
mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen
or doth he say this indeed for our sakes for these things are
written for our sakes that he that plougheth should plough in hope and
he that thrasheth in hope to receive fruit
if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great matter if
we reap your carnal things
if others be partakers of this power over you why not we rather
we should give any hindrance to the gospel of christ
know you not that they who work in the holy place eat the things
that are of the holy place and they that serve the altar partake with
the altar
so also the lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should
live by the gospel
but i have used none of these things neither have i written these
things that they should be so done unto me for it is good for me to
die rather than that any man should make my glory void
for if i preach the gospel it is no glory to me for a necessity
lieth upon me for woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel
for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against
my will a dispensation is committed to me
what is my reward then that preaching the gospel i may deliver
the gospel without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel
for whereas i was free as to all i made myself the servant of
all that i might gain the more
and i became to the jews a jew that i might gain the jews
to them that are under the law as if i were under the law
whereas myself was not under the law that i might gain them that
were under the law to them that were without the law as if i were
without the law whereas i was not without the law of god but was
in the law of christ that i might gain them that were without the law
to the weak i became weak that i might gain the weak i became
all things to all men that i might save all
and i do all things for the gospels sake that i may be made
partaker thereof
know you not that they that run in the race all run indeed but
one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain
and every one that striveth for the mastery refraineth himself
from all things and they indeed that they may receive a corruptible
crown but we an incorruptible one
i therefore so run not as at an uncertainty i so fight not as
one beating the air
but i chastise my body and bring it into subjection lest perhaps
when i have preached to others i myself should become a castaway
mortification to subdue the flesh and its inordinate desires
much upon favours received but to avoid their sins and fly from the
service of idols and from things offered to idols
for i would not have you ignorant brethren that our fathers were
all under the cloud and all passed through the sea
and all in moses were baptized in the cloud and in the sea
by passing under the cloud and through the sea and they partook of the
body and blood of christ in figure by eating of the manna called here
a spiritual food because it was a figure of the true bread which comes
down from heaven and drinking the water miraculously brought out of
the rock called here a spiritual rock because it was also a figure of
and did all eat the same spiritual food
and all drank the same spiritual drink and they drank of the
spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ
but with most of them god was not well pleased for they were
overthrown in the desert
now these things were done in a figure of us that we should not
covet evil things as they also coveted
neither become ye idolaters as some of them as it is written
neither let us commit fornication as some of them that committed
fornication and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand
neither let us tempt christ as some of them tempted and perished
by the serpent
neither do you murmur as some of them murmured and were
destroyed by the destroyer
now all these things happened to them in figure and they are
written for our correction upon whom the ends of the world are come
wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand let him take heed
lest he fall
let no temptation take hold on you but such as is human and
you are able but will make also with temptation issue that you may be
able to bear it
but what is human or incident to man issue or a way to escape
wherefore my dearly beloved fly from the service of idols
i speak as to wise men judge ye yourselves what i say
the chalice of benediction which we bless is it not the
communion of the blood of christ and the bread which we break is it
not the partaking of the body of the lord
of the body and blood of christ in the sacred mysteries and becoming
thereby one mystical body with christ from whence he infers ver
that they who are made partakers with christ by the eucharistic
sacrifice and sacrament must not be made partakers with devils by
eating of the meats sacrificed to them
for we being many are one bread one body all that partake of
one bread
partake of that one bread for it is by our communicating with christ
and with one another in this blessed sacrament that we are formed into
one mystical body and made as it were one bread compounded of many
grains of corn closely united together
behold israel according to the flesh are not they that eat of
the sacrifices partakers of the altar
what then do i say that what is offered in sacrifice to idols is
any thing or that the idol is any thing
but the things which the heathens sacrifice they sacrifice to
devils and not to god and i would not that you should be made partakers
with devils
you cannot drink the chalice of the lord and the chalice of
devils you cannot be partakers of the table of the lord and of the
table of devils
do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he all
things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient
all things are lawful for me but all things do not edify
let no man seek his own but that which is anothers
whatsoever is sold in the shambles eat asking no question for
conscience sake
the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof
if any of them that believe not invite you and you be willing
to go eat of any thing that is set before you asking no question for
conscience sake
but if any man say this has been sacrificed to idols do not eat
of it for his sake that told it and for conscience sake
conscience i say not thy own but the others for why is my
liberty judged by another mans conscience
if i partake with thanksgiving why am i evil spoken of for that
for which i give thanks
therefore whether you eat or drink or whatsoever else you do
do all to the glory of god
be without offence to the jew and to the gentiles and to the
church of god
as i also in all things please all men not seeking that which is
profitable to myself but to many that they may be saved
their love feasts and upon that occasion treats of the blessed
be ye followers of me as i also am of christ
now i praise you brethren that in all things you are mindful of
me and keep my ordinances as i have delivered them to you
but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ
and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god
every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth
his head
but every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered
disgraceth her head for it is all one as if she were shaven
for if a woman be not covered let her be shorn but if it be a
shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald let her cover her head
the man indeed ought not to cover his head because he is the
image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man
for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man
for the man was not created for the woman but the woman for the
man
therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head because
of the angels
power of her husband and this the apostle adds because of the angels
who are present in the assemblies of the faithful
but yet neither is the man without the woman nor the woman
without the man in the lord
for as the woman is of the man so also is the man by the woman
but all things of god
you yourselves judge doth it become a woman to pray unto god
uncovered
doth not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed if he
nourish his hair it is a shame unto him
but if a woman nourish her hair it is a glory to her for her
hair is given to her for a covering
but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom
nor the church of god
now this i ordain not praising you that you come together not
for the better but for the worse
for first of all i hear that when you come together in the
church there are schisms among you and in part i believe it
for there must be also heresies that they also who are approved
may be made manifest among you
mans heart not by gods will or appointment who nevertheless draws
good out of this evil manifesting by that occasion who are the good
and firm christians and making their faith more remarkable
when you come therefore together into one place it is not now to
eat the lords supper
observed by the primitive christians and reprehends the abuses of the
these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the eucharistic
sacrifice and sacrament
for every one taketh before his own supper to eat and one indeed
is hungry and another is drunk
what have you no houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye
the church of god and put them to shame that have not what shall i say
to you do i praise you in this i praise you not
for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto
you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took
bread
and giving thanks broke and said take ye and eat this is my
body which shall be delivered for you this do for the commemoration of
me
in like manner also the chalice after he had supped saying
you shall drink for the commemoration of me
for as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice
you shall shew the death of the lord until he come
therefore whosoever shall eat this bread or drink the chalice
of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of
the lord
and drink contrary to the original instead of or drink
demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of christ even to
the unworthy communicant who otherwise could not be guilty of the body
and blood of christ or justly condemned for not discerning the lords
body
but let a man prove himself and so let him eat of that bread and
drink of the chalice
of allowance viz where and when it is agreeable to the practice and
discipline of the church
for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
judgment to himself not discerning the body of the lord
therefore are there many infirm and weak among you and many
sleep
but if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged
but whilst we are judged we are chastised by the lord that we
be not condemned with this world
wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat wait for
one another
if any man be hungry let him eat at home that you come not
together unto judgment and the rest i will set in order when i come
like those of the natural body must mutually cherish one another
now concerning spiritual things my brethren i would not have you
ignorant
you know that when you were heathens you went to dumb idols
according as you were led
wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the
now there are diversities of graces but the same spirit
and there are diversities of ministries but the same lord
and there are diversities of operations but the same god who
worketh all in all
and the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man unto
profit
to one indeed by the spirit is given the word of wisdom and to
another the word of knowledge according to the same spirit
to another faith in the same spirit to another the grace of
healing in one spirit
to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to
another the discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of
tongues to another interpretation of speeches
but all these things one and the same spirit worketh dividing
to every one according as he will
for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members
of the body whereas they are many yet are one body so also is christ
for in one spirit were we all baptized into one body whether
been made to drink
for the body also is not one member but many
if the foot should say because i am not the hand i am not of
the body is it therefore not of the body
and if the ear should say because i am not the eye i am not of
the body is it therefore not of the body
if the whole body were the eye where would be the hearing if
the whole were hearing where would be the smelling
but now god hath set the members every one of them in the body
as it hath pleased him
and if they all were one member where would be the body
but now there are many members indeed yet one body
and the eye cannot say to the hand i need not thy help nor
again the head to the feet i have no need of you
yea much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of
the body are more necessary
and such as we think to be the less honourable members of the
body about these we put more abundant honour and those that are our
uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness
but our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body
together giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour
that there might be no schism in the body but the members might
be mutually careful one for another
and if one member suffer any thing all the members suffer with
it or if one member glory all the members rejoice with it
now you are the body of christ and members of member
and god indeed hath set some in the church first apostles
secondly prophets thirdly doctors after that miracles then the graces
of healings helps governments kinds of tongues interpretations of
speeches
are all apostles are all prophets are all doctors
are all workers of miracles have all the grace of healing do
all speak with tongues do all interpret
but be zealous for the better gifts and i shew unto you yet a
more excellent way
if i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not
charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal
and if i should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and
all knowledge and if i should have all faith so that i could remove
mountains and have not charity i am nothing
and if i should distribute all my goods to feed the poor and if i
should deliver my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth
me nothing
charity is patient is kind charity envieth not dealeth not
perversely is not puffed up
is not ambitious seeketh not her own is not provoked to anger
thinketh no evil
rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth with the truth
beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things
endureth all things
charity never falleth away whether prophecies shall be made void
or tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed
for we know in part and we prophesy in part
but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part
shall be done away
when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child
a child
we see now through a glass in a dark manner but then face to
face now i know in part but then i shall know even as i am known
and now there remain faith hope and charity these three but
the greatest of these is charity
strange tongues
follow after charity be zealous for spiritual gifts but rather
that you may prophesy
for he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men but unto
by them
but he that prophesieth speaketh to men unto edification and
exhortation and comfort
he that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself but he that
prophesieth edifieth the church
and i would have you all to speak with tongues but rather to
prophesy for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with
tongues unless perhaps he interpret that the church may receive
edification
but now brethren if i come to you speaking with tongues what
shall i profit you unless i speak to you either in revelation or in
knowledge or in prophecy or in doctrine
even things without life that give sound whether pipe or harp
except they give a distinction of sounds how shall it be known what is
piped or harped
for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare
himself to the battle
so likewise you except you utter by the tongue plain speech how
shall it be known what is said for you shall be speaking into the air
there are for example so many kinds of tongues in this world
and none is without voice
if then i know not the power of the voice i shall be to him to
whom i speak a barbarian and he that speaketh a barbarian to me
so you also forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits seek to
abound unto the edifying of the church
and therefore he that speaketh by a tongue let him pray that he
may interpret
for if i pray in a tongue my spirit prayeth but my
understanding is without fruit
what is it then i will pray with the spirit i will pray also
with the understanding i will sing with the spirit i will sing also
with the understanding
else if thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that
holdeth the place of the unlearned say amen to thy blessing because
he knoweth not what thou sayest
be qualified to join with you by saying amen to your blessing the use
or abuse of strange tongues of which the apostle here speaks does not
regard the public liturgy of the church in which strange tongues were
never used but certain conferences of the faithful ver etc in
which meeting together they discovered to one another their various
miraculous gifts of the spirit common in those primitive times amongst
which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of speaking
strange tongues because it was more to the public edification where
also not that the latin used in our liturgy is so far from being a
strange or unknown tongue that it is perhaps the best known tongue in
the world
for thou indeed givest thanks well but the other is not edified
i thank my god i speak with all your tongues
but in the church i had rather speak five words with my
understanding that i may instruct others also than ten thousand words
in a tongue
brethren do not become children in sense but in malice be
children and in sense be perfect
in the law it is written in other tongues and other lips i will
speak to this people and neither so will they hear me saith the lord
wherefore tongues are for a sign not to believers but to
unbelievers but prophecies not to unbelievers but to believers
if therefore the whole church come together into one place and
all speak with tongues and there come in unlearned persons or infidels
will they not say that you are mad
but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or
an unlearned person he is convinced of all he is judged of all
the secrets of his heart are made manifest and so falling down
on his face he will adore god affirming that god is among you indeed
how is it then brethren when you come together every one of
you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a revelation hath a tongue
hath an interpretation let all things be done to edification
if any speak with a tongue let it be by two or at the most by
three and in course and let one interpret
but if there be no interpreter let him hold his peace in the
church and speak to himself and to god
and let the prophets speak two or three and let the rest
judge
but if any thing be revealed to another sitting let the first
hold his peace
for you may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all
may be exhorted
and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets
for god is not the god of dissension but of peace as also i
teach in all the churches of the saints
let women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted
them to speak but to be subject as also the law saith
but if they would learn anything let them ask their husbands at
home for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church
or did the word of god come out from you or came it only unto
you
if any seem to be a prophet or spiritual let him know the things
that i write to you that they are the commandments of the lord
but if any man know not he shall not be known
wherefore brethren be zealous to prophesy and forbid not to
speak with tongues
but let all things be done decently and according to order
now i make known unto you brethren the gospel which i preached
to you which also you have received and wherein you stand
by which also you are saved if you hold fast after what manner i
preached unto you unless you have believed in vain
for i delivered unto you first of all which i also received how
that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
and that he was buried and that he rose again according to the
scriptures
and that he was seen by cephas and after that by the eleven
then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once of
whom many remain until this present and some are fallen asleep
after that he was seen by james then by all the apostles
and last of all he was seen also by me as by one born out of due
tine
for i am the least of the apostles who am not worthy to be called
an apostle because i persecuted the church of god
but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace in me hath
not been void but i have laboured more abundantly than all they yet
not i but the grace of god with me
for whether i or they so we preach and so you have believed
now if christ be preached that he arose again from the dead how
do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead
but if there be no resurrection of the dead then christ is not
risen again
and if christ be not risen again then is our preaching vain and
your faith is also vain
yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have
given testimony against god that he hath raised up christ whom he hath
not raised up if the dead rise not again
for if the dead rise not again neither is christ risen again
and if christ be not risen again your faith is vain for you are
yet in your sins
then they also that are fallen asleep in christ are perished
if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men
most miserable
but now christ is risen from the dead the firstfruits of them
that sleep
for by a man came death and by a man the resurrection of the
dead
and as in adam all die so also in christ all shall be made
alive
but every one in his own order the firstfruits christ then
they that are of christ who have believed in his coming
afterwards the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
to god and the father when he shall have brought to nought all
principality and power and virtue
for he must reign until he hath put all his enemies under his
feet
and the enemy death shall be destroyed last for he hath put
all things under his feet and whereas he saith
all things are put under him undoubtedly he is excepted who
put all things under him
and when all things shall be subdued unto him then the son also
himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him that
be subject to the father according to his human nature even after the
general resurrection and also the whole mystical body of christ will be
entirely subject to god obeying him in every thing
otherwise what shall they do that are baptized for the dead if
the dead rise not again at all why are they then baptized for them
a ceremony then in use but others more probably to the prayers and
penitential labours performed by the primitive christians for the souls
of the faithful departed or to the baptism of afflictions and
sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead
why also are we in danger every hour
i die daily i protest by your glory brethren which i have in
if according to man i fought with beasts at ephesus what doth
it profit me if the dead rise not again let us eat and drink for to
morrow we shall die
to rise again from the dead we might live like the impious and wicked
who have no belief in the resurrection
be not seduced evil communications corrupt good manners
awake ye just and sin not for some have not the knowledge of
but some man will say how do the dead rise again or with what
manner of body shall they come
senseless man that which thou sowest is not quickened except it
die first
and that which thou sowest thou sowest not the body that shall
be but bare grain as of wheat or of some of the rest
but god giveth it a body as he will and to every seed its proper
body
all flesh is not the same flesh but one is the flesh of men
another of beasts other of birds another of fishes
and there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial but one
is the glory of the celestial and another of the terrestrial
one is the glory of the sun another the glory of the moon and
another the glory of the stars for star differeth from star in glory
so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in
corruption it shall rise in incorruption
it is sown in dishonour it shall rise in glory it is sown in
weakness it shall rise in power
it is sown a natural body it shall rise a spiritual body if
there be a natural body there is also a spiritual body as it is
written
the first man adam was made into a living soul the last adam
into a quickening spirit
yet that was not first which is spiritual but that which is
natural afterwards that which is spiritual
the first man was of the earth earthly the second man from
heaven heavenly
such as is the earthly such also are the earthly and such as is
the heavenly such also are they that are heavenly
therefore as we have borne the image of the earthly let us bear
also the image of the heavenly
now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot possess the
kingdom of god neither shall corruption possess incorruption
behold i tell you a mystery we shall all indeed rise again but
we shall not all be changed
in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for
the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again incorruptible and
we shall be changed
for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal
must put on immortality
and when this mortal hath put on immortality then shall come to
pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory
o death where is thy victory o death where is thy sting
now the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law
but thanks be to god who hath given us the victory through our
therefore my beloved brethren be ye steadfast and unmoveable
always abounding in the work of the lord knowing that your labour is
not in vain in the lord
now concerning the collections that are made for the saints as i
have given order to the churches of galatia so do ye also
on the first day of the week let every one of you put apart with
himself laying up what it shall well please him that when i come the
collections be not then to be made
and when i shall be with you whomsoever you shall approve by
letters them will i send to carry your grace to jerusalem
and if it be meet that i also go they shall go with me
now i will come to you when i shall have passed through
and with you perhaps i shall abide or even spend the winter that
you may bring me on my way whithersoever i shall go
for i will not see you now by the way for i trust that i shall
abide with you some time if the lord permit
but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost
for a great door and evident is opened unto me and many
adversaries
now if timothy come see that he be with you without fear for he
worketh the work of the lord as i also do
let no man therefore despise him but conduct ye him on his way
in peace that he may come to me for i look for him with the brethren
and touching our brother apollo i give you to understand that i
much entreated him to come unto you with the brethren and indeed it was
not his will at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall
have leisure
watch ye stand fast in the faith do manfully and be
strengthened
let all your things be done in charity
and i beseech you brethren you know the house of stephanus and
of fortunatus and of achaicus that they are the firstfruits of achaia
and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints
that you also be subject to such and to every one that worketh
with us and laboureth
and i rejoice in the presence of stephanus and fortunatus and
supplied
for they have refreshed both my spirit and yours know them
therefore that are such
the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you
much in the lord with the church that is in their house with whom i
also lodge
all the brethren salute you salute one another with a holy kiss
the salutation of me paul with my own hand
if any man love not our lord jesus christ let him be anathema
maranatha
accursed maranatha which according to st jerome and st chrysostom
signify the lord is come already and therefore is to be taken as an
admonition to those who doubted of the resurrection and to put them in
mind that christ the judge of the living and the dead is come already
punish those with exemplary judgments and punishments that do not love
the lord jesus christ
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
my charity be with you all in christ jesus amen
admonitions to them in the former and absolves the incestuous man on
doing penance whom he had before excommunicated for his crime hence he
treats of true penance and of the dignity of the ministers of the new
society of infidels he gives an account of his sufferings and also of
the favours and graces which god hath bestowed on him this second
from some place in macedonia
levity the constancy and sincerity of his doctrine
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy
our brother to the church of god that is at corinth with all the
saints that are in all achaia
grace unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father
of mercies and the god of all comfort
who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we also may be able
to comfort them who are in all distress by the exhortation wherewith we
also are exhorted by god
for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so also by christ
doth our comfort abound
now whether we be in tribulation it is for your exhortation and
salvation or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation or
whether we be exhorted it is for your exhortation and salvation which
worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer
that our hope for you may be steadfast knowing that as you are
partakers of the sufferings so shall you be also of the consolation
for we would not have you ignorant brethren of our tribulation
which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above our
strength so that we were weary even of life
but we had in ourselves the answer of death that we should not
trust in ourselves but in god who raiseth the dead
who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers in
whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us
you helping withal in prayer for us that for this gift obtained
for us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many in our
behalf
for our glory is this the testimony of our conscience that in
simplicity of heart and sincerity of god and not in carnal wisdom but
in the grace of god we have conversed in this world and more
abundantly towards you
for we write no other things to you than what you have read and
known and i hope that you shall know unto the end
as also you have known us in part that we are your glory as you
also are ours in the day of our lord jesus christ
and in this confidence i had a mind to come to you before that
you might have a second grace
and to pass by you into macedonia and again from macedonia to
come to you and by you to be brought on my way towards judea
whereas then i was thus minded did i use lightness or the
things that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that there
should be with me it is and it is not
but god is faithful for our preaching which was to you was not
for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by
us by me and sylvanus and timothy was not it is and it is not but
apostles sometimes like modern sectaries saying it is and at other
times saying it is not but their doctrine was ever the same one
uniform yea in jesus christ one amen that is one truth in him
for all the promises of god are in him it is therefore also by
him amen to god unto our glory
now he that confirmeth us with you in christ and that hath
anointed us is god
who also hath sealed us and given the pledge of the spirit in our
hearts
but i call god to witness upon my soul that to spare you i came
not any more to corinth not because we exercise dominion over your
faith but we are helpers of your joy for in faith you stand
but i determined this with myself to come to you again in sorrow
for if i make you sorrowful who is he then that can make me glad
but the same who is made sorrowful by me
and i wrote this same to you that i may not when i come have
sorrow upon sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having
confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote to you
with many tears not that you should be made sorrowful but that you
might know the charity i have more abundantly towards you
and if any one have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in
part that i may not burden you all
to him who is such a one this rebuke is sufficient which is given
by many
so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort
him lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow
wherefore i beseech you that you would confirm your charity
towards him
for to this end also did i write that i may know the experiment of
you whether you be obedient in all things
and to whom you have pardoned any thing i also for what i have
pardoned if i have pardoned any thing for your sakes have i done it in
the person of christ
person and by the authority of christ to the incestuous corinthian
whom before he had put under penance which pardon consisted in a
releasing of part of the temporal punishment due to his sin
that we be not overreached by satan for we are not ignorant of
his devices
and when i was come to troas for the gospel of christ and a door
was opened unto me in the lord
i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother
but bidding them farewell i went into macedonia
now thanks be to god who always maketh us to triumph in christ
for we are the good odour of christ unto god in them that are
saved and in them that perish
to the one indeed the odour of death unto death but to the others
the odour of life unto life and for these things who is so sufficient
fragrant odour brought many to life was to others through their own
fault the occasion of death by their wilfully opposing and resisting
that divine call
for we are not as many adulterating the word of god but with
sincerity but as from god before god in christ we speak
do we begin again to commend ourselves or do we need as some do
epistles of commendation to you or from you
you are our epistle written in our hearts which is known and read
by all men
being manifested that you are the epistle of christ ministered by
us and written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not
in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart
and such confidence we have through christ towards god
not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves as of
ourselves but our sufficiency is from god
who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament not in
the letter but in the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit
quickeneth
now if the ministration of death engraven with letters upon
stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not
steadfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance
which is made void
how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory
for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more the
ministration of justice aboundeth in glory
for even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified by
reason of the glory that excelleth
for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which
remaineth is in glory
having therefore such hope we use much confidence
and not as moses put a veil upon his face that the children of
void
but their senses were made dull for until this present day the
selfsame veil in the reading of the old testament remaineth not taken
away because in christ it is made void
but even until this day when moses is read the veil is upon
their heart
but when they shall be converted to the lord the veil shall be
taken away
now the lord is a spirit and where the spirit of the lord is
there is liberty
but we all beholding the glory of the lord with open face are
transformed into the same image from glory to glory as by the spirit of
the lord
therefore seeing we have this ministration according as we have
obtained mercy we faint not
but we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in
craftiness nor adulterating the word of god but by manifestation of the
truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of
and if our gospel be also hid it is hid to them that are lost
in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of
unbelievers that the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is
the image of god should not shine unto them
for we preach not ourselves but jesus christ our lord and
ourselves your servants through jesus
for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath
shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency
may be of the power of god and not of us
in all things we suffer tribulation but are not distressed we
are straitened but are not destitute
we suffer persecution but are not forsaken we are cast down but
we perish not
always bearing about in our body the mortification of jesus that
the life also of jesus may be made manifest in our bodies
for we who live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake
that the life also of jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh
so then death worketh in us but life in you
but having the same spirit of faith as it is written i believed
for which cause i have spoken we also believe for which cause we speak
also
knowing that he who raised up jesus will raise us up also with
for all things are for your sakes that the grace abounding
through many may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of god
for which cause we faint not but though our outward man is
corrupted yet the inward man is renewed day by day
for that which is at present momentary and light of our
tribulation worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight
of glory
while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things
which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the
things which are not seen are eternal
charity to the corinthians
for we know if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved
that we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in
heaven
for in this also we groan desiring to be clothed upon with our
habitation that is from heaven
yet so that we be found clothed not naked
for we also who are in this tabernacle do groan being burthened
because we would not be unclothed but clothed upon that that which is
mortal may be swallowed up by life
now he that maketh us for this very thing is god who hath given us
the pledge of the spirit
therefore having always confidence knowing that while we are in
the body we are absent from the lord
for we walk by faith and not by sight
but we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from
the body and to be present with the lord
and therefore we labour whether absent or present to please him
for we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of christ
that every one may receive the proper things of the body according as
he hath done whether it be good or evil
after death the soul is rewarded or punished according to what it has
done in the body
knowing therefore the fear of the lord we use persuasion to men
but to god we are manifest and i trust also that in your consciences we
are manifest
we commend not ourselves again to you but give you occasion to
glory in our behalf that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory
in face and not in heart
for whether we be transported in mind it is to god or whether we
be sober it is for you
for the charity of christ presseth us judging this that if one
died for all then all were dead
and christ died for all that they also who live may not now live
to themselves but unto him who died for them and rose again
wherefore henceforth we know no man according to the flesh and
if we have known christ according to the flesh but now we know him so
no longer
man with regard to his nation family kindred or other natural
qualities or advantages but only with relation to christ and according
to the order of divine charity in god and for god the apostle adds
that even with respect to christ himself he now no longer considers him
according to the flesh by taking a satisfaction in his being his
countryman his affection being now purified from all such earthly
considerations
if then any be in christ a new creature the old things are passed
away behold all things are made new
but all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by
for god indeed was in christ reconciling the world to himself
not imputing to them their sins and he hath placed in us the word of
reconciliation
for christ therefore we are ambassadors god as it were exhorting
by us for christ we beseech you be reconciled to god
him who knew no sin he hath made sin for us that we might be
made the justice of god in him
associate with unbelievers
and we helping do exhort you that you receive not the grace of god
in vain
for he saith in an accepted time have i heard thee and in the day
of salvation have i helped thee behold now is the acceptable time
behold now is the day of salvation
giving no offence to any man that our ministry be not blamed
but in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of god
in much patience in tribulation in necessities in distresses
in stripes in prisons in seditions in labours in watchings in
fastings
in chastity in knowledge in longsuffering in sweetness in the
in the word of truth in the power of god by the armour of justice
on the right hand and on the left
by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as
deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet known
as dying and behold we live as chastised and not killed
as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as needy yet enriching many
as having nothing and possessing all things
our mouth is open to you o ye corinthians our heart is enlarged
you are not straitened in us but in your own bowels you are
straitened
but having the same recompense i speak as to my children be you
also enlarged
bear not the yoke with unbelievers for what participation hath
justice with injustice or what fellowship hath light with darkness
and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath the
faithful with the unbeliever
and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for you are
the temple of the living god as god saith i will dwell in them and
walk among them and i will be their god and they shall be my people
wherefore go out from among them and be ye separate saith the
and i will receive you and will be a father to you and you shall
be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty
their account
having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse
ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit perfecting
sanctification in the fear of god
receive us we have injured no man we have corrupted no man we
have overreached no man
i speak not this to your condemnation for we have said before that
you are in our hearts to die together and to live together
great is my confidence for you great is my glorying for you i am
filled with comfort i exceedingly abound with joy in all our
tribulation
for also when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest
but we suffered all tribulation combats without fears within
but god who comforteth the humble comforted us by the coming of
and not by his coming only but also by the consolation wherewith
he was comforted in you relating to us your desire your mourning your
zeal for me so that i rejoiced the more
for although i made you sorrowful by my epistle i do not repent
time did make you sorrowful
now i am glad not because you were made sorrowful but because you
were made sorrowful unto penance for you were made sorrowful according
to god that you might suffer damage by us in nothing
for the sorrow that is according to god worketh penance steadfast
unto salvation but the sorrow of the world worketh death
for behold this selfsame thing that you were made sorrowful
according to god how great carefulness it worketh in you yea defence
yea indignation yea fear yea desire yea zeal yea revenge in all
things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter
wherefore although i wrote to you it was not for his sake that
did the wrong nor for him that suffered it but to manifest our
carefulness that we have for you
before god therefore we were comforted but in our consolation we
did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of titus because his spirit
was refreshed by you all
and if i have boasted any thing to him of you i have not been put
to shame but as we have spoken all things to you in truth so also our
boasting that was made to titus is found a truth
and his bowels are more abundantly towards you remembering the
obedience of you all how with fear and trembling you received him
i rejoice that in all things i have confidence in you
now we make known unto you brethren the grace of god that hath
been given in the churches of macedonia
that in much experience of tribulation they have had abundance of
joy and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their
simplicity
for according to their power i bear them witness and beyond their
power they were willing
with much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the
ministry that is done toward the saints
and not as we hoped but they gave their own selves first to the
insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so also he
would finish among you this same grace
that as in all things you abound in faith and word and knowledge
and all carefulness moreover also in your charity towards us so in
this grace also you may abound
i speak not as commanding but by the carefulness of others
approving also the good disposition of your charity
for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that being rich he
became poor for your sakes that through his poverty you might be rich
and herein i give my advice for this is profitable for you who
have begun not only to do but also to be willing a year ago
now therefore perform ye it also in deed that as your mind is
forward to be willing so it may be also to perform out of that which
you have
for if the will be forward it is accepted according to that which
a man hath not according to that which he hath not
for i mean not that others should be eased and you burdened but
by an equality
in this present time let your abundance supply their want that
their abundance also may supply your want that there may be an
equality
as it is written he that had much had nothing over and he that
had little had no want
and thanks be to god who hath given the same carefulness for you
in the heart of titus
for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more careful
of his own will he went unto you
we have sent also with him the brother whose praise is in the
gospel through all the churches
and not that only but he was also ordained by the churches
companion of our travels for this grace which is administered by us
to the glory of the lord and our determined will
avoiding this lest any man should blame us in this abundance
which is administered by us
for we forecast what may be good not only before god but also
before men
and we have sent with them our brother also whom we have often
proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent with much
confidence in you
either for titus who is my companion and fellow labourer towards
you or our brethren the apostles of the churches the glory of christ
wherefore shew ye to them in the sight of the churches the
evidence of your charity and of our boasting on your behalf
for concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints it is
superfluous for me to write unto you
for i know your forward mind for which i boast of you to the
emulation hath provoked very many
now i have sent the brethren that the thing which we boast of
concerning you be not made void in this behalf that as i have said
you may be ready
lest when the macedonians shall come with me and find you
unprepared we not to say ye should be ashamed in this matter
therefore i thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they
would go to you before and prepare this blessing before promised to be
ready so as a blessing not as covetousness
now this i say he who soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly
and he who soweth in blessings shall also reap blessings
every one as he hath determined in his heart not with sadness or
of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver
and god is able to make all grace abound in you that ye always
having all sufficiently in all things may abound to every good work
as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the
poor his justice remaineth for ever
and he that ministereth seed to the sower will both give you bread
to eat and will multiply your seed and increase the growth of the fruits
of your justice
that being enriched in all things you may abound unto all
simplicity which worketh through us thanksgiving to god
because the administration of this office doth not only supply the
want of the saints but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the
by the proof of this ministry glorifying god for the obedience of
your confession unto the gospel of christ and for the simplicity of your
communicating unto them and unto all
and in their praying for you being desirous of you because of
the excellent grace of god in you
thanks be to god for his unspeakable gift
power of his apostleship
now i paul myself beseech you by the mildness and modesty of
bold toward you
but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with
that confidence wherewith i am thought to be bold against some who
reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh
for though we walk in the flesh we do not war according to the
flesh
for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty to god
unto the pulling down of fortifications destroying counsels
and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of
of christ
and having in readiness to revenge all disobedience when your
obedience shall be fulfilled
see the things that are according to outward appearance if any
man trust to himself that he is christs let him think this again with
himself that as he is christs so are we also
for if also i should boast somewhat more of our power which the
should not be ashamed
but that i may not be thought as it were to terrify you by
epistles
for his epistles indeed say they are weighty and strong but
his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible
let such a one think this that such as we are in word by
epistles when absent such also we will be indeed when present
for we dare not match or compare ourselves with some that commend
themselves but we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare ourselves
with ourselves
but we will not glory beyond our measure but according to the
measure of the rule which god hath measured to us a measure to reach
even unto you
for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as if we reached
not unto you for we are come as far as to you in the gospel of christ
not glorying beyond measure in other mens labours but having
hope of your increasing faith to be magnified in you according to our
rule abundantly
yea unto those places that are beyond you to preach the gospel
not to glory in another mans rule in those things that are made ready
to our hand
but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord
for not he who commendeth himself is approved but he whom god
commendeth
should be imposed upon by the false apostles
would to god you could bear with some little of my folly but do
bear with me
speaking is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity though the
apostle was constrained to do it for the good of the souls committed to
his charge
for i am jealous of you with the jealousy of god for i have
espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin
to christ
but i fear lest as the serpent seduced eve by his subtilty so
your minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity that is in
for if he that cometh preacheth another christ whom we have not
preached or if you receive another spirit whom you have not received
or another gospel which you have not received you might well bear with
him
for i suppose that i have done nothing less than the great
apostles
for although i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but in all
things we have been made manifest to you
or did i commit a fault humbling myself that you might be
exalted because i preached unto you the gospel of god freely
i have taken from other churches receiving wages of them for your
ministry
and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to
no man for that which was wanting to me the brethren supplied who came
from macedonia and in all things i have kept myself from being
burthensome to you and so i will keep myself
the truth of christ is in me that this glorying shall not be
broken off in me in the regions of achaia
wherefore because i love you not god knoweth it
but what i do that i will do that i may cut off the occasion
from them that desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be
found even as we
for such false apostles are deceitful workmen transforming
themselves into the apostles of christ
and no wonder for satan himself transformeth himself into an
angel of light
therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as
the ministers of justice whose end shall be according to their works
i say again let no man think me to be foolish otherwise take me
as one foolish that i also may glory a little
that which i speak i speak not according to god but as it were
in foolishness in this matter of glorying
seeing that many glory according to the flesh i will glory also
for you gladly suffer the foolish whereas yourselves are wise
for you suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour
you if a man take from you if a man be lifted up if a man strike you
on the face
i seek according to dishonour as if we had been weak in this
part wherein if any man dare i speak foolishly i dare also
they are hebrews so am i they are israelites so am i they
are the seed of abraham so am i
they are the ministers of christ i speak as one less wise i am
more in many more labours in prisons more frequently in stripes above
measure in deaths often
of the jews five times did i receive forty stripes save one
thrice was i beaten with rods once i was stoned thrice i
suffered shipwreck a night and a day i was in the depth of the sea
in journeying often in perils of waters in perils of robbers
in perils from my own nation in perils from the gentiles in perils in
the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils
from false brethren
in labour and painfulness in much watchings in hunger and
thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness
besides those things which are without my daily instance the
solicitude for all the churches
day
who is weak and i am not weak who is scandalized and i am not
on fire
if i must needs glory i will glory of the things that concern my
infirmity
the god and father of our lord jesus christ who is blessed for
ever knoweth that i lie not
at damascus the governor of the nation under aretas the king
guarded the city of the damascenes to apprehend me
and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and
so escaped his hands
the corinthians
if i must glory it is not expedient indeed but i will come to
visions and revelations of the lord
i know a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the
body i know not or out of the body i know not god knoweth such a
one caught up to the third heaven
and i know such a man whether in the body or out of the body i
know not god knoweth
that he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words which
it is not granted to man to utter
for such an one i will glory but for myself i will glory nothing
but in my infirmities
for though i should have a mind to glory i shall not be foolish
for i will say the truth but i forbear lest any man should think of me
above that which he seeth in me or any thing he heareth from me
and lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me there
was given me a sting of my flesh an angel of satan to buffet me
for which thing thrice i besought the lord that it might depart
from me
and he said to me my grace is sufficient for thee for power is
made perfect in infirmity gladly therefore will i glory in my
infirmities that the power of christ may dwell in me
shines forth in our weakness and infirmity as the more weak we are of
ourselves the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us and
giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts
for which cause i please myself in my infirmities in reproaches
in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christ for when i
am weak then am i powerful
i am become foolish you have compelled me for i ought to have
been commended by you for i have no way come short of them that are
above measure apostles although i be nothing
yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you in all
patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds
for what is there that you have had less than the other churches
but that i myself was not burthensome to you pardon me this injury
behold now the third time i am ready to come to you and i will
not be burthensome unto you for i seek not the things that are yours
but you for neither ought the children to lay up for the parents but
the parents for the children
but i most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls
although loving you more i be loved less
but be it so i did not burthen you but being crafty i caught
you by guile
did i overreach you by any of them whom i sent to you
i desired titus and i sent with him a brother did titus
overreach you did we not walk with the same spirit did we not in the
same steps
of old think you that we excuse ourselves to you we speak
before god in christ but all things my dearly beloved for your
edification
for i fear lest perhaps when i come i shall not find you such
as i would and that i shall be found by you such as you would not lest
perhaps contentions envyings animosities dissensions detractions
whisperings swellings seditions be among you
lest again when i come god humble me among you and i mourn
many of them that sinned before and have not done penance for the
uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed
behold this is the third time i am coming to you in the mouth of
two or three witnesses shall every word stand
i have told before and foretell as present and now absent to
them that sinned before and to all the rest that if i come again i
will not spare
do you seek a proof of christ that speaketh in me who towards you
is not weak but is mighty in you
for although he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by
the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with
him by the power of god towards you
try your own selves if you be in the faith prove ye yourselves
perhaps you be reprobates
but i trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates
now we pray god that you may do no evil not that we may appear
approved but that you may do that which is good and that we may be as
reprobates
our power in punishing you
for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth
for we rejoice that we are weak and you are strong this also we
pray for your perfection
therefore i write these things being absent that being
present i may not deal more severely according to the power which the
for the rest brethren rejoice be perfect take exhortation be
of one mind have peace and the god of grace and of love shall be with
you
salute one another with a holy kiss all the saints salute you
the grace of our lord jesus christ and the charity of god and the
communication of the holy ghost be with you all amen
seduced by some false teachers who had been jews and who were for
obliging all christians even those who had been gentiles to observe
circumcision and the other ceremonies of the mosaical law in this
their calumny against his mission and apostleship the subject matter of
this epistle is much the same as that to the romans it was written at
