philosophy of the heathens being void of faith and humility betrayed
them into shameful sins
paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated
unto the gospel of god
which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy
scriptures
concerning his son who was made to him of the seed of david
according to the flesh
who was predestinated the son of god in power according to the
spirit of sanctification by the resurrection of our lord jesus christ
from the dead
power that is by his working stupendous miracles secondly by the
spirit of sanctification that is by his infinite sanctity thirdly by
his ressurection or raising himself from the dead
by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the
faith in all nations for his name
among whom are you also the called of jesus christ
to all that are at rome the beloved of god called to be saints
first i give thanks to my god through jesus christ for you all
because your faith is spoken of in the whole world
for god is my witness whom i serve in my spirit in the gospel of
his son that without ceasing i make a commemoration of you
always in my prayers making request if by any means now at length
for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual
grace to strengthen you
that is to say that i may be comforted together in you by that
which is common to us both your faith and mine
and i would not have you ignorant brethren that i have often
purposed to come unto you and have been hindered hitherto that i might
have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles
to the greeks and to the barbarians to the wise and to the
unwise i am a debtor
so as much as is in me i am ready to preach the gospel to you
also that are at rome
for i am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of god
unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and to the
for the justice of god is revealed therein from faith unto faith
as it is written the just man liveth by faith
for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of god in
injustice
because that which is known of god is manifest in them for god
hath manifested it unto them
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen being understood by the things that are made his eternal
power also and divinity so that they are inexcusable
because that when they knew god they have not glorified him as
foolish heart was darkened
for professing themselves to be wise they became fools
and they changed the glory of the incorruptible god into the
likeness of the image of a corruptible man and of birds and of
fourfooted beasts and of creeping things
wherefore god gave them up to the desires of their heart unto
uncleanness to dishonour their own bodies among themselves
who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served
the creature rather than the creator who is blessed for ever amen
for this cause god delivered them up to shameful affections for
their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against
nature
withdrawing his grace and so permitting them in punishment of their
pride to fall into those shameful sins
and in like manner the men also leaving the natural use of the
women have burned in their lusts one towards another men with men
working that which is filthy and receiving in themselves the recompense
which was due to their error
and as they liked not to have god in their knowledge god
delivered them up to a reprobate sense to do those things which are not
convenient
being filled with all iniquity malice fornication avarice
wickedness full of envy murder contention deceit malignity
whisperers
detractors hateful to god contumelious proud haughty
inventors of evil things disobedient to parents
foolish dissolute without affection without fidelity without
mercy
who having known the justice of god did not understand that they
who do such things are worthy of death and not only they that do them
but they also that consent to them that do them
wherefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that
judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for
thou dost the same things which thou judgest
for we know that the judgment of god is according to truth
against them that do such things
and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them who do such things
and dost the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god
or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and patience and
longsuffering knowest thou not that the benignity of god leadeth thee
to penance
but according to thy hardness and impenitent heart thou treasurest
up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the just
judgment of god
who will render to every man according to his works
to them indeed who according to patience in good work seek glory
and honour and incorruption eternal life
but to them that are contentious and who obey not the truth but
give credit to iniquity wrath and indignation
tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil
of the jew first and also of the greek
but glory and honour and peace to every one that worketh good to
the jew first and also to the greek
for there is no respect of persons with god
for whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without the
law and whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law
for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers
of the law shall be justified
for when the gentiles who have not the law do by nature those
things that are of the law these having not the law are a law to
themselves
who shew the work of the law written in their hearts their
conscience bearing witness to them and their thoughts between
themselves accusing or also defending one another
in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus
but if thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy
boast of god
and knowest his will and approvest the more profitable things
being instructed by the law
art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light
of them that are in darkness
an instructor of the foolish a teacher of infants having the
form of knowledge and of truth in the law
thou therefore that teachest another teachest not thyself thou
that preachest that men should not steal stealest
thou that sayest men should not commit adultery committest
adultery thou that abhorrest idols committest sacrilege
thou that makest thy boast of the law by transgression of the
law dishonourest god
for the name of god through you is blasphemed among the gentiles
as it is written
circumcision profiteth indeed if thou keep the law but if thou
be a transgressor of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision
if then the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law shall not
this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision
and shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision if it fulfil
the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision art a
transgressor of the law
for it is not he is a jew who is so outwardly nor is that
circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh
but he is a jew that is one inwardly and the circumcision is that
of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of
men but of god
justified by the works of the law but only by the grace of christ
what advantage then hath the jew or what is the profit of
circumcision
much every way first indeed because the words of god were
committed to them
for what if some of them have not believed shall their unbelief
make the faith of god without effect god forbid
but god is true and every man a liar as it is written that thou
mayest be justified in thy words and mayest overcome when thou art
judged
to lies and errors nevertheless god who is the truth will make good
his promise of keeping his church in all truth see st john
but if our injustice commend the justice of god what shall we say
i speak according to man god forbid otherwise how shall god
judge this world
for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his
glory why am i also yet judged as a sinner
and not rather as we are slandered and as some affirm that we say
let us do evil that there may come good whose damnation is just
what then do we excel them no not so for we have charged both
as it is written there is not any man just
nature or of the law of moses but only by faith and grace
there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after
all have turned out of the way they are become unprofitable
together there is none that doth good there is not so much as one
their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have
dealt deceitfully the venom of asps is under their lips
whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
their feet swift to shed blood
destruction and misery in their ways
and the way of peace they have not known
there is no fear of god before their eyes
now we know that what things soever the law speaketh it speaketh
to them that are in the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the
world may be made subject to god
because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before
him for by the law is the knowledge of sin
but now without the law the justice of god is made manifest
being witnessed by the law and the prophets
even the justice of god by faith of jesus christ unto all and
upon all them that believe in him for there is no distinction
for all have sinned and do need the glory of god
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that
is in christ jesus
whom god hath proposed to be a propitiation through faith in his
blood to the shewing of his justice for the remission of former sins
through the forbearance of god for the shewing of his justice in
this time that he himself may be just and the justifier of him who is
of the faith of jesus christ
where is then thy boasting it is excluded by what law of
works no but by the law of faith
for we account a man to be justified by faith without the works
of the law
justification is not a presumptuous assurance of our being justified
but a firm and lively belief of all that god has revealed or promised
short a faith which takes in hope love repentance and the use of the
sacraments and the works which he here excludes are only the works of
the law that is such as are done by the law of nature or that of
follow faith and proceed from it
is he the god of the jews only is he not also of the gentiles
yes of the gentiles also
for it is one god that justifieth circumcision by faith and
uncircumcision through faith
do we then destroy the law through faith god forbid but we
establish the law
by faith and that before he was circumcised gentiles by faith are
his children
what shall we say then that abraham hath found who is our father
according to the flesh
for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory
but not before god
faith in him not before god whatever glory or applause such works
might procure from men they would be of no value in the sight of god
for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was
reputed to him unto justice
justification proceedeth from gods free grace and bounty and not from
any efficacy which any act of ours could have of its own nature
abstracting from gods grace
now to him that worketh the reward is not reckoned according to
grace but according to debt
own performances whereas he who worketh not that is who presumeth not
upon any works done by his own strength but seeketh justice through
faith and grace is freely justified by gods grace
but to him that worketh not yet believeth in him that justifieth
the ungodly his faith is reputed to justice according to the purpose
of the grace of god
as david also termeth the blessedness of a man to whom god reputeth
justice without works
blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are
covered
covered that is blessed are those who by doing penance have
obtained pardon and remission of their sins and also are covered that
is newly clothed with the habit of grace and vested with the stole of
charity
blessed is the man to whom the lord hath not imputed sin
blessed is the man who hath retained his baptismal innocence that no
grievous sin can be imputed to him and likewise blessed is the man
who after fall into sin hath done penance and leads a virtuous life by
frequenting the sacraments necessary for obtaining the grace to prevent
a relapse that sin is no more imputed to him
this blessedness then doth it remain in the circumcision only or
in the uncircumcision also for we say that unto abraham faith was
reputed to justice
circumcised no says the apostle but also for the uncircumcised
before he was circumcised
how then was it reputed when he was in circumcision or in
uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision
and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the justice of
the faith which he had being uncircumcised that he might be the father
of all them that believe being uncircumcised that unto them also it
may be reputed to justice
and he might be the father of circumcision not to them only that
are of the circumcision but to them also that follow the steps of the
faith that is in the uncircumcision of our father abraham
for not through the law was the promise to abraham or to his seed
that he should be heir of the world but through the justice of faith
for if they who are of the law be heirs faith is made void the
promise is made of no effect
be heirs of the blessings promised to abraham then that faith which was
so much praised in him will be found to be of little value and the
very promise will be made void by which he was promised to be the
father not of the jews only but of all nations of believers
for the law worketh wrath for where there is no law neither is
there transgression
worketh wrath occasionally by being an occasion of many transgressions
which provoke gods wrath
therefore is it of faith that according to grace the promise
might be firm to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but
to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us
all
as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations
before god whom he believed who quickeneth the dead and calleth those
things that are not as those that are
who against hope believed in hope that he might be made the
father of many nations according to that which was said to him so
shall thy seed be
and he was not weak in faith neither did he consider his own
body now dead whereas he was almost an hundred years old nor the
dead womb of sara
in the promise also of god he staggered not by distrust but was
strengthened in faith giving glory to god
most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised he is able
also to perform
and therefore it was reputed to him unto justice
now it is not written only for him that it was reputed to him
unto justice
but also for us to whom it shall be reputed if we believe in him
that raised up jesus christ our lord from the dead
who was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our
justification
grace and life by christ
being justified therefore by faith let us have peace with god
through our lord jesus christ
by whom also we have access through faith into this grace wherein
we stand and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of god
and not only so but we glory also in tribulation knowing that
tribulation worketh patience
and patience trial and trial hope
and hope confoundeth not because the charity of god is poured
forth in our hearts by the holy ghost who is given to us
for why did christ when as yet we were weak according to the
time die for the ungodly
for scarce for a just man will one die yet perhaps for a good man
some one would dare to die
but god commendeth his charity towards us because when as yet we
were sinners according to the time
christ died for us much more therefore being now justified by his
blood shall we be saved from wrath through him
for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the
death of his son much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his
life
and not only so but also we glory in god through our lord jesus
wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and by sin
death and so death passed upon all men in whom all have sinned
for until the law sin was in the world but sin was not imputed
when the law was not
was it imputed to them in the manner it was afterwards when they
transgressed the known written law of god
but death reigned from adam unto moses even over them also who
have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of adam who
is a figure of him who was to come
but not as the offence so also the gift for if by the offence of
one many died much more the grace of god and the gift by the grace of
one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many
and not as it was by one sin so also is the gift for judgment
indeed was by one unto condemnation but grace is of many offences unto
justification
for if by one mans offence death reigned through one much more
they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift and of justice shall
reign in life through one jesus christ
therefore as by the offence of one unto all men to condemnation
so also by the justice of one unto all men to justification of life
for as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners so
also by the obedience of one many shall be made just
now the law entered in that sin might abound and where sin
abounded grace did more abound
to abound but that it so happened through mans perversity taking
occasion of sinning more from the prohibition of sin
that as sin hath reigned to death so also grace might reign by
justice unto life everlasting through jesus christ our lord
what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may
abound
god forbid for we that are dead to sin how shall we live any
longer therein
know you not that all we who are baptized in christ jesus are
baptized in his death
for we are buried together with him by baptism into death that as
walk in newness of life
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection
knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body
of sin may be destroyed to the end that we may serve sin no longer
concupiscence coming to us from adam is called our old man as our
state reformed in and by christ is called the new man and the vices
and sins which then ruled in us are named the body of sin
for he that is dead is justified from sin
now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall live also
together with christ
knowing that christ rising again from the dead dieth now no more
for in that he died to sin he died once but in that he liveth
he liveth unto god
so do you also reckon that you are dead to sin but alive unto
let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body so as to obey the
lusts thereof
neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin
but present yourselves to god as those that are alive from the dead
and your members as instruments of justice unto god
for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under
the law but under grace
what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but
under grace god forbid
know you not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey
his servants you are whom you obey whether it be of sin unto death or
of obedience unto justice
but thanks be to god that you were the servants of sin but have
obeyed from the heart unto that form of doctrine into which you have
been delivered
being then freed from sin we have been made servants of justice
i speak an human thing because of the infirmity of your flesh
unto iniquity so now yield your members to serve justice unto
sanctification
for when you were the servants of sin you were free men to
justice
what fruit therefore had you then in those things of which you are
now ashamed for the end of them is death
but now being made free from sin and become servants to god you
have your fruit unto sanctification and the end life everlasting
for the wages of sin is death but the grace of god life
everlasting in christ jesus our lord
the inclination to it still tempts us
know you not brethren for i speak to them that know the law that
the law hath dominion over a man as long as it liveth
for the woman that hath an husband whilst her husband liveth is
bound to the law but if her husband be dead she is loosed from the law
of her husband
therefore whilst her husband liveth she shall be called an
adulteress if she be with another man but if her husband be dead she
is delivered from the law of her husband so that she is not an
adulteress if she be with another man
therefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the
body of christ that you may belong to another who is risen again from
the dead that we may bring forth fruit to god
for when we were in the flesh the passions of sins which were by
the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death
but now we are loosed from the law of death wherein we were
detained so that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the
oldness of the letter
what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid but i do not
know sin but by the law for i had not known concupiscence if the law
did not say thou shalt not covet
but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence for without the law sin was dead
because it is from sin and leads to sin which was asleep before was
weakened by the prohibition the law not being the cause thereof nor
properly giving occasion to it but occasion being taken by our corrupt
nature to resist the commandment laid upon us
and i lived some time without the law but when the commandment
came sin revived
and i died and the commandment that was ordained to life the
same was found to be unto death to me
for sin taking occasion by the commandment seduced me and by it
killed me
wherefore the law indeed is holy and the commandment holy and
just and good
was that then which is good made death unto me god forbid but
sin that it may appear sin by that which is good wrought death in me
that sin by the commandment might become sinful above measure
it is which is even capable to take occasion from that which is good
to work death
for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under
sin
for that which i work i understand not for i do not that good
which i will but the evil which i hate that i do
disorderly motions of passion and concupiscence which oftentimes in us
get the start of reason and by means of which even good men suffer in
the inferior appetite what their will abhors and are much hindered in
the accomplishment of the desires of their spirit and mind but these
evil motions though they are called the law of sin because they come
from original sin and violently tempt and incline to sin as long as
the will does not consent to them are not sins because they are not
voluntary
if then i do that which i will not i consent to the law that it
is good
now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
for i know that there dwelleth not in me that is to say in my
flesh that which is good for to will is present with me but to
accomplish that which is good i find not
for the good which i will i do not but the evil which i will
not that i do
now if i do that which i will not it is no more i that do it but
sin that dwelleth in me
i find then a law that when i have a will to do good evil is
present with me
for i am delighted with the law of god according to the inward
man
but i see another law in my members fighting against the law of
my mind and captivating me in the law of sin that is in my members
unhappy man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this
death
the grace of god by jesus christ our lord therefore i myself
with the mind serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin
not according to the flesh but according to the spirit their strong
hope and love of god
there is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in christ
for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath delivered
me from the law of sin and of death
for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the
flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and of
sin hath condemned sin in the flesh
that the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk
not according to the flesh but according to the spirit
for they that are according to the flesh mind the things that are
of the flesh but they that are according to the spirit mind the things
that are of the spirit
for the wisdom of the flesh is death but the wisdom of the spirit
is life and peace
because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to god for it is not
subject to the law of god neither can it be
and they who are in the flesh cannot please god
but you are not in the flesh but the spirit if so be that the
and if christ be in you the body indeed is dead because of sin
but the spirit liveth because of justification
and if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
in you he that raised up jesus christ from the dead shall quicken also
your mortal bodies because of his spirit that dwelleth in you
therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live
according to the flesh
for if you live according to the flesh you shall die but if by
the spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh you shall live
for whosoever are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of
for you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear but
you have received the spirit of adoption of sons whereby we cry abba
father
for the spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit that we are
the sons of god
peace of conscience which the children of god experience they have a
kind of testimony of gods favour by which they are much strengthened
in their hope of their justification and salvation but yet not so as to
pretend to an absolute assurance which is not usually granted in this
mortal life during which we are taught to work out our salvation with
fear and trembling phil and that he that thinketh himself to
stand must take heed lest he fall cor see also rom

and if sons heirs also heirs indeed of god and joint heirs with
with him
for i reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory to come that shall be revealed in us
for the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of
the sons of god
creation made for the use and service of man and by occasion of his
sin made subject to vanity that is to a perpetual instability
tending to corruption and other defects so that by a figure of speech
it is here said to groan and be in labour and to long for its
deliverance which is then to come when sin shall reign no more and
separate and to be in everlasting happiness in heaven
for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by
reason of him that made it subject in hope
because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the
servitude of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children
of god
for we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain
even till now
and not only it but ourselves also who have the firstfruits of
the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the
adoption of the sons of god the redemption of our body
for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for
what a man seeth why doth he hope for
but if we hope for that which we see not we wait for it with
patience
likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmity for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit himself asketh for
us with unspeakable groanings
and to pray in us inasmuch as he inspireth prayer and teacheth us to
pray
and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what the spirit desireth
because he asketh for the saints according to god
and we know that to them that love god all things work together
unto good to such as according to his purpose are called to be
saints
for whom he foreknew he also predestinated to be made conformable
to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn amongst many
brethren
elect should be conformable to the image of his son we must not here
offer to pry into the secrets of gods eternal election only firmly
believe that all our good in time and eternity flows originally from
and whom he predestinated them he also called and whom he
called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also
glorified
what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who is
against us
he that spared not even his own son but delivered him up for us
all how hath he not also with him given us all things
who shall accuse against the elect of god god is he that
justifieth
who is he that shall condemn christ jesus that died yea that is
risen also again who is at the right hand of god who also maketh
intercession for us
who then shall separate us from the love of christ shall
tribulation or distress or famine or nakedness or danger or
persecution or the sword
as it is written for thy sake we are put to death all the day
long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
but in all these things we overcome because of him that hath
loved us
for i am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor
principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor
might
nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to
separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
confined to their nation
i speak the truth in christ i lie not my conscience bearing me
witness in the holy ghost
that i have great sadness and continual sorrow in my heart
for i wished myself to be an anathema from christ for my brethren
who are my kinsmen according to the flesh
the jews was so great that he was willing to suffer even an anathema
or curse for their sake or any evil that could come upon him without
his offending god
who are israelites to whom belongeth the adoption as of children
and the glory and the testament and the giving of the law and the
service of god and the promises
whose are the fathers and of whom is christ according to the
flesh who is over all things god blessed for ever amen
not as though the word of god hath miscarried for all are not
he heretofore preferred isaac before ismael and jacob before esau so
he could and did by the like free grace election and mercy raise up
spiritual children by faith to abraham and israel from among the
neither are all they that are the seed of abraham children but in
that is to say not they that are the children of the flesh are the
children of god but they that are the children of the promise are
accounted for the seed
for this is the word of promise according to this time will i
come and sara shall have a son
and not only she but when rebecca also had conceived at once of
for when the children were not yet born nor had done any good or
evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand
of the younger to the elder the drift of the apostle is to shew that
nation as the jews imagined nor to any prerogative of birth or any
forgoing merits for as antecedently to his grace he sees no merits in
any but finds all involved in sin in the common mass of condemnation
and all children of wrath there is no one whom he might not justly
leave in that mass so that whomsoever he delivers from it he delivers
in his mercy and whomsoever he leaves in it he leaves in his justice
to pardon one whilst he suffers justice to take place in the execution
of the other
not of works but of him that calleth it was said to her the
elder shall serve the younger
as it is written jacob i have loved but esau i have hated
what shall we say then is there injustice with god god forbid
for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have
mercy and i will shew mercy to whom i will shew mercy
so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth
but of god that sheweth mercy
own abstracting from the grace of god
for the scripture saith to pharao to this purpose have i raised
thee that i may shew my power in thee and that my name may be declared
throughout all the earth
sin and so be damned but foreseeing his obstinacy in sin and the
abuse of his own free will he raised him up to be a mighty king to
make a more remarkable example of him and that his power might be
better known and his justice in punishing him published throughout the
earth
therefore he hath mercy on whom he will and whom he will he
hardeneth
withholding his grace and so leaving him in his sin in punishment of
his past demerits
thou wilt say therefore to me why doth he then find fault for
who resisteth his will
o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing
formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus
or hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to
make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour
dispute with our maker nor to reason with him why he does not give as
uch grace to one as to another for since the whole lump of our clay is
vitiated by sin it is owing to his goodness and mercy that he makes
out of it so many vessels of honor and it is no more than just that
others in punishment of their unrepented sins should be given up to be
vessels of dishonor
what if god willing to shew his wrath and to make his power
known endured with much patience vessels of wrath fitted for
destruction
that he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy
which he hath prepared unto glory
even us whom also he hath called not only of the jews but also
of the gentiles
as in osee he saith i will call that which was not my people my
people and her that was not beloved beloved and her that had not
obtained mercy one that hath obtained mercy
and it shalt be in the place where it was said unto them you are
not my people there they shall be called the sons of the living god
and isaias cried out concerning israel if the number of the
children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved
shall be converted and saved how perversely is this text quoted for the
salvation of men of all religions when it speaks only of the converts
of the children of israel
for he shall finish his word and cut it short in justice because
a short word shall the lord make upon the earth
and isaias foretold unless the lord of sabbath had left us a
seed we had been made as sodom and we had been like unto gomorrha
what then shall we say that the gentiles who followed not after
justice have attained to justice even the justice that is of faith
but israel by following after the law of justice is not come
unto the law of justice
why so because they sought it not by faith but as it were of
works for they stumbled at the stumblingstone
as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and a
rock of scandal and whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded
to cannot be justified
brethren the will of my heart indeed and my prayer to god is for
them unto salvation
for i bear them witness that they have a zeal of god but not
according to knowledge
for they not knowing the justice of god and seeking to establish
their own have not submitted themselves to the justice of god
pretended to by their own strength or by the observance of the law
without faith in christ
for the end of the law is christ unto justice to everyone that
believeth
for moses wrote that the justice which is of the law the man that
shall do it shall live by it
but the justice which is of faith speaketh thus say not in thy
heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down
or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ
again from the dead
but what saith the scripture the word is nigh thee even in thy
mouth and in thy heart this is the word of faith which we preach
for if thou confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and believe in
thy heart that god hath raised him up from the dead thou shalt be
saved
name of the lord ver is not barely the professing a belief in the
person of christ but moreover implies a belief of his whole doctrine
and an obedience to his law without which the calling him lord will
save no man st matt
for with the heart we believe unto justice but with the
mouth confession is made unto salvation
for the scripture saith whosoever believeth in him shall not be
confounded
for there is no distinction of the jew and the greek for the
same is lord over all rich unto all that call upon him
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be
saved
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed
they hear without a preacher
and how shall they preach unless they be sent as it is written
them that bring glad tidings of good things
teachers who have all usurped to themselves the ministry without any
lawful mission derived by succession from the apostles to whom christ
said john as my father hath sent me i also send you
but all do not obey the gospel for isaias saith lord who hath
believed our report
faith then cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of christ
but i say have they not heard yes verily their sound hath
gone forth into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the
whole world
but i say hath not israel known first moses saith i will
provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation by a foolish
nation i will anger you
but isaias is bold and saith i was found by them that did not
seek me i appeared openly to them that asked not after me
but to israel he saith all the day long have i spread my hands
to a people that believeth not and contradicteth me
stand in faith and fear
i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also
am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin
god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew know you not
what the scripture saith of elias how he calleth on god against israel
lord they have slain thy prophets they have dug down thy altars
but what saith the divine answer to him i have left me seven
thousand men that have not bowed their knees to baal
perpetual visibility of the church of christ the more because however
the number of the faithful might be abridged by the persecution of
time in a most flourishing condition under asa and josaphat in the
kingdom of judah
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant saved
according to the election of grace
and if by grace it is not now by works otherwise grace is no
more grace
by nature without faith and grace salvation would not be a grace or
favour but a debt but such dead works are indeed of no value in the
sight of god towards salvation it is not the same with regard to works
done with and by gods grace for to such works as these he has
promised eternal salvation
what then that which israel sought he hath not obtained but the
election hath obtained it and the rest have been blinded
as it is written god hath given them the spirit of insensibility
eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear until
this present day
his permission and by withdrawing his grace in punishment of their
obstinacy
and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a
stumbling block and a recompense unto them
let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down
their back always
i say then have they so stumbled that they should fall god
forbid but by their offence salvation is come to the gentiles that
they may be emulous of them
without remedy cast off for ever but in part only many thousands of
them having been at first converted and for a time which fall of
theirs god has been pleased to turn to the good of the gentiles
now if the offence of them be the riches of the world and the
diminution of them the riches of the gentiles how much more the fulness
of them
for i say to you gentiles as long indeed as i am the apostle of
the gentiles i will honour my ministry
if by any means i may provoke to emulation them who are my
flesh and may save some of them
for if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world what
shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead
for if the firstfruit be holy so is the lump also and if the
root be holy so are the branches
and if some of the branches be broken and thou being a wild
olive art ingrafted in them and art made partaker of the root and of
the fatness of the olive tree
boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest
not the root but the root thee
thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be
grafted in
well because of unbelief they were broken off but thou standest
by faith be not highminded but fear
he who standeth by faith may fall from it and therefore must live in
fear and not in the vain presumption and security of modern sectaries
for if god hath not spared the natural branches fear lest
perhaps also he spare not thee
see then the goodness and the severity of god towards them
indeed that are fallen the severity but towards thee the goodness of
not to be proud nor to glory against the jews but to take occasion
rather from their fall to fear and to be humble lest they be cast off
secured by so many divine promises in holy writ but that each one in
particular may fall and therefore all in general are to be admonished
to beware of that which may happen to any one in particular
and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be
grafted in for god is able to graft them in again
for if thou were cut out of the wild olive tree which is natural
to thee and contrary to nature wert grafted into the good olive tree
how much more shall they that are the natural branches be grafted into
their own olive tree
for i would not have you ignorant brethren of this mystery
lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part
has happened in israel until the fulness of the gentiles should come
in
and so all israel should be saved as it is written there shall
come out of sion he that shall deliver and shall turn away ungodliness
from jacob
and this is to them my covenant when i shall take away their
sins
as concerning the gospel indeed they are enemies for your sake
but as touching the election they are most dear for the sake of the
fathers
for the gifts and the calling of god are without repentance
himself of them for the promises of god are unchangeable nor can he
repent of conferring his gifts
for as you also in times past did not believe god but now have
obtained mercy through their unbelief
so these also now have not believed for your mercy that they
also may obtain mercy
for god hath concluded all in unbelief that he may have mercy on
all
their own free will so that their calling and election is purely owing
to his mercy
o the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of
ways
for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his
counsellor
or who hath first given to him and recompense shall be made him
for of him and by him and in him are all things to him be
glory for ever amen
i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercy of god that you
present your bodies a living sacrifice holy pleasing unto god your
reasonable service
and be not conformed to this world but be reformed in the newness
of your mind that you may prove what is the good and the acceptable and
the perfect will of god
for i say by the grace that is given me to all that are among
you not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise but to be wise
unto sobriety and according as god hath divided to every one the measure
of faith
for as in one body we have many members but all the members have
not the same office
so we being many are one body in christ and every one members
one of another
and having different gifts according to the grace that is given
us either prophecy to be used according to the rule of faith
or ministry in ministering or he that teacheth in doctrine
he that exhorteth in exhorting he that giveth with simplicity
he that ruleth with carefulness he that sheweth mercy with
cheerfulness
let love be without dissimulation hating that which is evil
cleaving to that which is good
loving one another with the charity of brotherhood with honour
preventing one another
in carefulness not slothful in spirit fervent serving the lord
rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation instant in prayer
communicating to the necessities of the saints pursuing
hospitality
bless them that persecute you bless and curse not
rejoice with them that rejoice weep with them that weep
being of one mind one towards another not minding high things
but consenting to the humble be not wise in your own conceits
to no man rendering evil for evil providing good things not
only in the sight of god but also in the sight of all men
if it be possible as much as is in you have peace with all men
revenge not yourselves my dearly beloved but give place unto
wrath for it is written revenge is mine i will repay saith the lord
but if the enemy be hungry give him to eat if he thirst give
him to drink for doing this thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his
head
be not overcome by evil but overcome evil by good
let every soul be subject to higher powers for there is no power
but from god and those that are ordained of god
therefore he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of
for princes are not a terror to the good work but to the evil
thou shalt have praise from the same
for he is gods minister to thee for good but if thou do that
which is evil fear for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is
wherefore be subject of necessity not only for wrath but also
for conscience sake
for therefore also you pay tribute for they are the ministers of
render therefore to all men their dues tribute to whom tribute
is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom
honour
owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth
his neighbour hath fulfilled the law
for thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou
shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not
covet and if there be any other commandment it is comprised in this
word thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
the love of our neighbour worketh no evil love therefore is the
fulfilling of the law
and that knowing the season that it is now the hour for us to
rise from sleep for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed
the night is passed and the day is at hand let us therefore
cast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light
let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and
drunkenness not in chambering and impurities not in contention and
envy
but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for
the flesh in its concupiscences
scandal
now him that is weak in faith take unto you not in disputes
about thoughts
for one believeth that he may eat all things but he that is weak
let him eat herbs
unclean meats prescribed by the law of moses which was now no longer
obligatory some weak christians converted from among the jews as we
here gather from the apostle made a scruple of eating such meats as
were deemed unclean by the law such as swines flesh etc which the
stronger sort of christians did eat without scruple now the apostle to
reconcile them together exhorts the former not to judge or condemn the
latter using their christian liberty and the latter to take care not
to despise or scandalize their weaker brethren either by bringing them
to eat what in their conscience they think they should not or by giving
them such offence as to endanger the driving them thereby from the
let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and he that
eateth not let him not judge him that eateth for god hath taken him to
him
who art thou that judgest another mans servant to his own lord
he standeth or falleth and he shall stand for god is able to make him
stand
for one judgeth between day and day and another judgeth every
day let every man abound in his own sense
law
he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he that
eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth thanks to god and he that
eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth thanks to god
for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself
for whether we live we live unto the lord or whether we die we
die unto the lord therefore whether we live or whether we die we are
the lords
for to this end christ died and rose again that he might be lord
both of the dead and of the living
but thou why judgest thou thy brother or thou why dost thou
despise thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of
for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall
bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god
therefore every one of us shall render account to god for
himself
let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this
rather that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brothers
way
i know and am confident in the lord jesus that nothing is
unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to
him it is unclean
for if because of thy meat thy brother be grieved thou walkest
not now according to charity destroy not him with thy meat for whom
let not then our good be evil spoken of
for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but justice and
peace and joy in the holy ghost
for he that in this serveth christ pleaseth god and is approved
of men
therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace and
keep the things that are of edification one towards another
destroy not the work of god for meat all things indeed are
clean but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence
it is good not to eat flesh and not to drink wine nor any thing
whereby thy brother is offended or scandalized or made weak
hast thou faith have it to thyself before god blessed is he
that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth
but he that discerneth if he eat is condemned because not of
faith for all that is not of faith is sin
his conscience what he deems unclean of faith by faith is here
understood judgment and conscience to act against which is always a
sin
now we that are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the
weak and not to please ourselves
let every one of you please his neighbour unto good to
edification
for christ did not please himself but as it is written the
reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me
for what things soever were written were written for our learning
that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures we might have
hope
now the god of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one
mind one towards another according to jesus christ
that with one mind and with one mouth you may glorify god and the
wherefore receive one another as christ also hath received you
unto the honour of god
for i say that christ jesus was minister of the circumcision for
the truth of god to confirm the promises made unto the fathers
ministry towards the jews the people of the circumcision
but that the gentiles are to glorify god for his mercy as it is
written therefore will i confess to thee o lord among the gentiles
and will sing to thy name
and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people
and again praise the lord all ye gentiles and magnify him all
ye people
and again isaias saith there shall be a root of jesse and he
that shall rise up to rule the gentiles in him the gentiles shall hope
now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing
that you may abound in hope and in the power of the holy ghost
and i myself also my brethren am assured of you that you also
are full of love replenished with all knowledge so that you are able
to admonish one another
but i have written to you brethren more boldly in some sort as
it were putting you in mind because of the grace which is given me from
that i should be the minister of christ jesus among the gentiles
sanctifying the gospel of god that the oblation of the gentiles may be
made acceptable and sanctified in the holy ghost
i have therefore glory in christ jesus towards god
for i dare not to speak of any of those things which christ
worketh not by me for the obedience of the gentiles by word and deed
by the virtue of signs and wonders in the power of the holy
have replenished the gospel of christ
and i have so preached this gospel not where christ was named
lest i should build upon another man a foundation
but as it is written they to whom he was not spoken of shall
see and they that have not heard shall understand
for which cause also i was hindered very much from coming to you
and have been kept away till now
but now having no more place in these countries and having a
great desire these many years past to come unto you
when i shall begin to take my journey into spain i hope that as
first in part i shall have enjoyed you
but now i shall go to jerusalem to minister unto the saints
for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a
contribution for the poor of the saints that are in jerusalem
for it hath pleased them and they are their debtors for if the
also in carnal things to minister to them
when therefore i shall have accomplished this and consigned to
them this fruit i will come by you into spain
and i know that when i come to you i shall come in the abundance
of the blessing of the gospel of christ
i beseech you therefore brethren through our lord jesus christ
and by the charity of the holy ghost that you help me in your prayers
for me to god
that i may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in judea
and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in jerusalem to
the saints
that i may come to you with joy by the will of god and may be
refreshed with you
now the god of peace be with you all amen
oppose the doctrine they had learned
and i commend to you phebe our sister who is in the ministry of
the church that is in cenchrae
that you receive her in the lord as becometh saints and that you
assist her in whatsoever business she shall have need of you for she
also hath assisted many and myself also
salute prisca and aquila my helpers in christ jesus
who have for my life laid down their own necks to whom not i
only give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles
and the church which is in their house salute epenetus my
beloved who is the firstfruits of asia in christ
salute mary who hath laboured much among you
salute andronicus and junias my kinsmen and fellow prisoners who
are of note among the apostles who also were in christ before me
salute ampliatus most beloved to me in the lord

salute apellas approved in christ
salute them that are of aristobulus household salute herodian
my kinsman salute them that are of narcissus household who are in the

brethren that are with them
salute philologus and julia nereus and his sister and olympias
and all the saints that are with them
salute one another with an holy kiss all the churches of christ
salute you
now i beseech you brethren to mark them who make dissensions
and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid
them
for they that are such serve not christ our lord but their own
belly and by pleasing speeches and good words seduce the hearts of the
innocent
for your obedience is published in every place i rejoice
therefore in you but i would have you to be wise in good and simple in
evil
and the god of peace crush satan under your feet speedily the
grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
timothy my fellow labourer saluteth you and lucius and jason

the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
now to him that is able to establish you according to my gospel
and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the
mystery which was kept secret from eternity
which now is made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets
according to the precept of the eternal god for the obedience of faith
known among all nations
to god the only wise through jesus christ to whom be honour
and glory for ever and ever amen
a year and a half and converted a great many went to ephesus after
being there three years he wrote this first epistle to the corinthians
and sent it by the same persons stephanus fortunatus and achaicus who
had brought their letter to him it was written about twentyfour years
after our lords ascension and contains several matters appertaining to
faith and morals and also to ecclesiastical discipline
