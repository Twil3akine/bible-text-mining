rebuked
paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ according to
the faith of the elect of god and the acknowledging of the truth which
is according to godliness
unto the hope of life everlasting which god who lieth not hath
promised before the times of the world
but hath in due times manifested his word in preaching which is
committed to me according to the commandment of god our saviour
to titus my beloved son according to the common faith grace and
peace from god the father and from christ jesus our saviour
for this cause i left thee in crete that thou shouldest set in
order the things that are wanting and shouldest ordain priests in every
city as i also appointed thee
if any be without crime the husband of one wife having faithful
children not accused of riot or unruly
for a bishop must be without crime as the steward of god not
proud not subject to anger nor given to wine no striker not greedy
of filthy lucre
but given to hospitality gentle sober just holy continent
embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine that
he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the
gainsayers
for there are also many disobedient vain talkers and seducers
especially they who are of the circumcision
who must be reproved who subvert whole houses teaching things
which they ought not for filthy lucres sake
one of them a prophet of their own said the cretans are always
liars evil beasts slothful bellies
this testimony is true wherefore rebuke them sharply that they
may be sound in the faith
not giving heed to jewish fables and commandments of men who turn
themselves away from the truth
all things are clean to the clean but to them that are defiled
and to unbelievers nothing is clean but both their mind and their
conscience are defiled
they profess that they know god but in their works they deny him
being abominable and incredulous and to every good work reprobate
but speak thou the things that become sound doctrine
that the aged men be sober chaste prudent sound in faith in
love in patience
the aged women in like manner in holy attire not false accusers
not given to much wine teaching well
that they may teach the young women to be wise to love their
husbands to love their children
to be discreet chaste sober having a care of the house gentle
obedient to their husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed
young men in like manner exhort that they be sober
in all things shew thyself an example of good works in doctrine
in integrity in gravity
the sound word that can not be blamed that he who is on the
contrary part may be afraid having no evil to say of us
exhort servants to be obedient to their masters in all things
pleasing not gainsaying
not defrauding but in all things shewing good fidelity that they
may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things
for the grace of god our saviour hath appeared to all men
instructing us that denying ungodliness and worldly desires we
should live soberly and justly and godly in this world
looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great
who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity
and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable a pursuer of good
works
these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let
no man despise thee
admonish them to be subject to princes and powers to obey at a
word to be ready to every good work
to speak evil of no man not to be litigious but gentle shewing
all mildness towards all men
for we ourselves also were some time unwise incredulous erring
slaves to divers desires and pleasures living in malice and envy
hateful and hating one another
but when the goodness and kindness of god our saviour appeared
not by the works of justice which we have done but according to
his mercy he saved us by the laver of regeneration and renovation of
the holy ghost
whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly through jesus christ
our saviour
that being justified by his grace we may be heirs according to
hope of life everlasting
it is a faithful saying and these things i will have thee affirm
constantly that they who believe in god may be careful to excel in good
works these things are good and profitable unto men
but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and
strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain
a man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition
avoid
knowing that he that is such an one is subverted and sinneth
being condemned by his own judgment
church by the sentence of the pastors of the same church heretics
more unhappy run out of the church of their own accord and by doing
so give judgment and sentence against their own souls
when i shall send to thee artemas or tychicus make haste to come
unto me to nicopolis for there i have determined to winter
send forward zenas the lawyer and apollo with care that nothing
be wanting to them
and let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary
uses that they be not unfruitful
all that are with me salute thee salute them that love us in the
faith the grace of god be with you all amen
robbed him and fled to rome where he met st paul who was then a
prisoner there the first time the apostle took compassion on him and
received him with tenderness and converted him to the faith for he was
a gentile before st paul sends him back to his master with this
yet the apostle writes with becoming dignity and authority it contains
divers profitable instructions and points out the charity and humanity
that masters should have for their servants
