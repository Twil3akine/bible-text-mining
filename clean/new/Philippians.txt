paul and timothy the servants of jesus christ to all the saints
in christ jesus who are at philippi with the bishops and deacons
grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord
i give thanks to my god in every remembrance of you
always in all my prayers making supplication for you all with joy
for your communication in the gospel of christ from the first day
unto now
being confident of this very thing that he who hath begun a good
work in you will perfect it unto the day of christ jesus
as it is meet for me to think this for you all for that i have you
in my heart and that in my bands and in the defence and confirmation
of the gospel you all are partakers of my joy
for god is my witness how i long after you all in the bowels of
and this i pray that your charity may more and more abound in
knowledge and in all understanding
that you may approve the better things that you may be sincere
and without offence unto the day of christ
filled with the fruit of justice through jesus christ unto the
glory and praise of god
now brethren i desire you should know that the things which have
happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel
so that my bands are made manifest in christ in all the court and
in all other places
and many of the brethren in the lord growing confident by my
bands are much more bold to speak the word of god without fear
some indeed even out of envy and contention but some also for
good will preach christ
some out of charity knowing that i am set for the defence of the
gospel
and some out of contention preach christ not sincerely supposing
that they raise affliction to my bands
but what then so that by all means whether by occasion or by
truth christ be preached in this also i rejoice yea and will
rejoice
for i know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation through
your prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ
according to my expectation and hope that in nothing i shall be
confounded but with all confidence as always so now also shall
for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
and if to live in the flesh this is to me the fruit of labour
immediately for christ would be his gain by putting him presently in
possession of heaven yet he is doubtful what he should choose because
by staying longer in the flesh he should be more beneficial to the
souls of his neighbours
but i am straitened between two having a desire to be dissolved
and to be with christ a thing by far the better
but to abide still in the flesh is needful for you
and having this confidence i know that i shall abide and continue
with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith
that your rejoicing may abound in christ jesus for me by my
coming to you again
only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of christ
that whether i come and see you or being absent may hear of you
that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind labouring together for
the faith of the gospel
and in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries which to them
is a cause of perdition but to you of salvation and this from god
for unto you it is given for christ not only to believe in him
but also to suffer for him
having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me and now
have heard of me
salvation with fear and trembling
if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of
charity if any society of the spirit if any bowels of commiseration
fulfil ye my joy that you be of one mind having the same charity
being of one accord agreeing in sentiment
let nothing be done through contention neither by vain glory but
in humility let each esteem others better than themselves
each one not considering the things that are his own but those
that are other mens
for let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal
with god
but emptied himself taking the form of a servant being made in
the likeness of men and in habit found as a man
he humbled himself becoming obedient unto death even to the death
of the cross
for which cause god also hath exalted him and hath given him a
name which is above all names
that in the name of jesus every knee should bow of those that are
in heaven on earth and under the earth
and that every tongue should confess that the lord jesus christ is
in the glory of god the father
wherefore my dearly beloved as you have always obeyed not as
in my presence only but much more now in my absence with fear and
trembling work out your salvation
security of modern sectaries
for it is god who worketh in you both to will and to accomplish
according to his good will
and do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations
that you may be blameless and sincere children of god without
reproof in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom
you shine as lights in the world
holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of christ
because i have not run in vain nor laboured in vain
yea and if i be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of
your faith i rejoice and congratulate with you all
and for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice and congratulate
with me
and i hope in the lord jesus to send timothy unto you shortly
that i also may be of good comfort when i know the things concerning
you
for i have no man so of the same mind who with sincere affection
is solicitous for you
for all seek the things that are their own not the things that are
now know ye the proof of him that as a son with the father so
hath he served with me in the gospel
him therefore i hope to send unto you immediately so soon as i
shall see how it will go with me
and i trust in the lord that i myself also shall come to you
shortly
but i have thought it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my
brother and fellow labourer and fellow soldier but your apostle and he
that hath ministered to my wants
for indeed he longed after you all and was sad for that you had
heard that he was sick
for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him
sorrow
therefore i sent him the more speedily that seeing him again
you may rejoice and i may be without sorrow
receive him therefore with all joy in the lord and treat with
honour such as he is
because for the work of christ he came to the point of death
delivering his life that he might fulfil that which on your part was
wanting towards my service
that he may gain christ
as to the rest my brethren rejoice in the lord to write the same
things to you to me indeed is not wearisome but to you is necessary
beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision
for we are the circumcision who in spirit serve god and glory in
though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other
thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh i more
being circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the
tribe of benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews according to the law a
according to zeal persecuting the church of god according to the
justice that is in the law conversing without blame
but the things that were gain to me the same i have counted loss
for christ
furthermore i count all things to be but loss for the excellent
knowledge of jesus christ my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of
all things and count them but as dung that i may gain christ
and may be found in him not having my justice which is of the
law but that which is of the faith of christ jesus which is of god
justice in faith
that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the
fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable to his death
if by any means i may attain to the resurrection which is from the
dead
not as though i had already attained or were already perfect but
apprehended by christ jesus
brethren i do not count myself to have apprehended but one thing
to those that are before
i press towards the mark to the prize of the supernal vocation of
let us therefore as many as are perfect be thus minded and if
in any thing you be otherwise minded this also god will reveal to you
nevertheless whereunto we are come that we be of the same mind
let us also continue in the same rule
be ye followers of me brethren and observe them who walk so as
you have our model
for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you
weeping that they are enemies of the cross of christ
whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose
glory is in their shame who mind earthly things
but our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for
the saviour our lord jesus christ
who will reform the body of our lowness made like to the body of
his glory according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue
all things unto himself
charitable contributions to him
therefore my dearly beloved brethren and most desired my joy and
my crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved
i beg of evodia and i beseech syntyche to be of one mind in the
and i entreat thee also my sincere companion help those women who
have laboured with me in the gospel with clement and the rest of my
fellow labourers whose names are in the book of life
rejoice in the lord always again i say rejoice
let your modesty be known to all men the lord is nigh
be nothing solicitous but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to
and the peace of god which surpasseth all understanding keep your
hearts and minds in christ jesus
for the rest brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever
modest whatsoever just whatsoever holy whatsoever lovely whatsoever
of good fame if there be any virtue if any praise of discipline think
on these things
apostle enumerates general precepts of morality which they ought to
practise whatsoever things are true in words in promises in lawful
oaths etc he commands rectitude of mind and sincerity of heart
modesty in dress and decency in conversation whatsoever just that
is in dealing with others in buying or selling in trade or business
to be fair and honest whatsoever holy by these words may be
understood that those who are in a religious state professed or in
holy orders should lead a life of sanctity and chastity according to
the vows they make but these words being also applied to those in the
world indicate the virtuous life they are bound by the divine
commandments to follow whatsoever lovely that is to practise those
good offices in society that procure us the esteem and good will of our
neighbours whatsoever of good fame that is that by our conduct and
behaviour we should edify our neighbours and give them good example by
our actions if there be any virtue if any praise of discipline
that those in error by seeing the morality and good discipline of the
true religion may be converted and finally the apostle commands not
only the philippians but all christians to think on these things
that is to make it their study and concern that the peace of god might
be with them
the things which you have both learned and received and heard and
seen in me these do ye and the god of peace shall be with you
now i rejoice in the lord exceedingly that now at length your
thought for me hath flourished again as you did also think but you
were busied
i speak not as it were for want for i have learned in whatsoever
state i am to be content therewith
i know both how to be brought low and i know how to abound every
where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be
hungry both to abound and to suffer need
i can do all things in him who strengtheneth me
nevertheless you have done well in communicating to my
tribulation
and you also know o philippians that in the beginning of the
gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me
as concerning giving and receiving but you only
for unto thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use
not that i seek the gift but i seek the fruit that may abound to
your account
but i have all and abound i am filled having received from
sacrifice pleasing to god
and may my god supply all your want according to his riches in
glory in christ jesus
now to god and our father be glory world without end amen
salute ye every saint in christ jesus
the brethren who are with me salute you all the saints salute
you especially they that are of caesars household
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen
converted by epaphras a disciple of the apostles however as st paul
was the great apostle of the gentiles he wrote this epistle to the
to the ephesians and philippians the exhortations and doctrine it
contains are similar to that which is set forth in his epistle to the
