faith and to eternal life into which we are to enter by many
tribulations he exhorts to holiness of life considering the holiness
of god and our redemption by the blood of christ
peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers dispersed
through pontus cappadocia asia and bithynia elect
according to the foreknowledge of god the father unto the
sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood
of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who
according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope by
the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
unto an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that cannot
fade reserved in heaven for you
who by the power of god are kept by faith unto salvation ready
to be revealed in the last time
wherein you shalt greatly rejoice if now you must be for a little
time made sorrowful in divers temptations
that the trial of your faith much more precious than gold which is
tried by the fire may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the
appearing of jesus christ
whom having not seen you love in whom also now though you see him
not you believe and believing shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and
glorified
receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls
of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently
searched who prophesied of the grace to come in you
searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ in them
did signify when it foretold those sufferings that are in christ and
the glories that should follow
to whom it was revealed that not to themselves but to you they
ministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have
preached the gospel to you the holy ghost being sent down from heaven
on whom the angels desire to look
wherefore having the loins of your mind girt up being sober
trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of
as children of obedience not fashioned according to the former
desires of your ignorance
but according to him that hath called you who is holy be you
also in all manner of conversation holy
because it is written you shall be holy for i am holy
and if you invoke as father him who without respect of persons
judgeth according to every ones work converse in fear during the time
of your sojourning here
knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as
gold or silver from your vain conversation of the tradition of your
fathers
but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb unspotted and
undefiled
foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world but
manifested in the last times for you
who through him are faithful in god who raised him up from the
dead and hath given him glory that your faith and hope might be in god
purifying your souls in the obedience of charity with a brotherly
love from a sincere heart love one another earnestly
being born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible by
the word of god who liveth and remaineth for ever
for all flesh is as grass and all the glory thereof as the flower
of grass the grass is withered and the flower thereof is fallen away
but the word of the lord endureth for ever and this is the word
which by the gospel hath been preached unto you
being now his people walk worthily of him with submission to superiors
and patience under sufferings
wherefore laying away all malice and all guile and dissimulations
and envies and all detractions
as newborn babes desire the rational milk without guile that
thereby you may grow unto salvation
if so be you have tasted that the lord is sweet
unto whom coming as to a living stone rejected indeed by men but
chosen and made honourable by god
be you also as living stones built up a spiritual house a holy
priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus
wherefore it is said in the scripture behold i lay in sion a
chief corner stone elect precious and he that shall believe in him
shall not be confounded
to you therefore that believe he is honour but to them that
believe not the stone which the builders rejected the same is made the
head of the corner
and a stone of stumbling and a rock of scandal to them who stumble
at the word neither do believe whereunto also they are set
but you are a chosen generation a kingly priesthood a holy
nation a purchased people that you may declare his virtues who hath
called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
who in times past were not a people but are now the people of
dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims to
refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul
having your conversation good among the gentiles that whereas
they speak against you as evildoers they may by the good works which
they shall behold in you glorify god in the day of visitation
be ye subject therefore to every human creature for gods sake
whether it be to the king as excelling
or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and
for the praise of the good
for so is the will of god that by doing well you may put to
silence the ignorance of foolish men
as free and not as making liberty a cloak for malice but as the
servants of god
honour all men love the brotherhood fear god honour the king
servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to
the good and gentle but also to the froward
for this is thankworthy if for conscience towards god a man
endure sorrows suffering wrongfully
for what glory is it if committing sin and being buffeted for
it you endure but if doing well you suffer patiently this is
thankworthy before god
for unto this are you called because christ also suffered for us
leaving you an example that you should follow his steps
who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth
who when he was reviled did not revile when he suffered he
threatened not but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly
who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree that we
being dead to sins should live to justice by whose stripes you were
healed
for you were as sheep going astray but you are now converted to
the shepherd and bishop of your souls
seek exhortations to divers virtues
in like manner also let wives be subject to their husbands that
if any believe not the word they may be won without the word by the
conversation of the wives
considering your chaste conversation with fear
whose adorning let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair or
the wearing of gold or the putting on of apparel
but the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptibility of a quiet
and a meek spirit which is rich in the sight of god
for after this manner heretofore the holy women also who trusted
in god adorned themselves being in subjection to their own husbands
as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters you are
doing well and not fearing any disturbance
ye husbands likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge
giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the
coheirs of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered
and in fine be ye all of one mind having compassion one of
another being lovers of the brotherhood merciful modest humble
not rendering evil for evil nor railing for railing but
contrariwise blessing for unto this are you called that you may
inherit a blessing
for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his
tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile
let him decline from evil and do good let him seek after peace
and pursue it
because the eyes of the lord are upon the just and his ears unto
their prayers but the countenance of the lord upon them that do evil
things
and who is he that can hurt you if you be zealous of good
but if also you suffer any thing for justice sake blessed are
ye and be not afraid of their fear and be not troubled
but sanctify the lord christ in your hearts being ready always to
satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you
but with modesty and fear having a good conscience that whereas
they speak evil of you they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good
conversation in christ
for it is better doing well if such be the will of god to suffer
than doing ill
because christ also died once for our sins the just for the
unjust that he might offer us to god being put to death indeed in the
flesh but enlivened in the spirit
in which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in
prison
middle state of souls for these spirits in prison to whom christ went
to preach after his death were not in heaven nor yet in the hell of
the damned because heaven is no prison and christ did not go to preach
to the damned
which had been some time incredulous when they waited for the
patience of god in the days of noe when the ark was a building wherein
a few that is eight souls were saved by water
whereunto baptism being of the like form now saveth you also
not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the examination of
a good conscience towards god by the resurrection of jesus christ
the water by which noe was saved because the one was a figure of the
other not the putting away etc as much as to say that baptism has
not its efficacy in order to salvation from its washing away any
bodily filth or dirt but from its purging the conscience from sin when
accompanied with suitable dispositions in the party to answer the
interrogations made at that time with relation to faith the renouncing
of satan with all his works and the obedience to gods commandments
who is on the right hand of god swallowing down death that we
might be made heirs of life everlasting being gone into heaven the
angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him
glory of god to be willing to suffer for christ
christ therefore having suffered in the flesh be you also armed
with the same thought for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath
ceased from sins
that now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh not after
the desires of men but according to the will of god
for the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the
wine revellings banquetings and unlawful worshipping of idols
wherein they think it strange that you run not with them into the
same confusion of riotousness speaking evil of you
who shall render account to him who is ready to judge the living
and the dead
for for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead that
they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh but may live
according to god in the spirit
but the end of all is at hand be prudent therefore and watch in
prayers
but before all things have a constant mutual charity among
yourselves for charity covereth a multitude of sins
using hospitality one towards another without murmuring
as every man hath received grace ministering the same one to
another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god
if any man speak let him speak as the words of god if any
minister let him do it as of the power which god administereth that
in all things god may be honoured through jesus christ to whom is glory
and empire for ever and ever amen
dearly beloved think not strange the burning heat which is to try
you as if some new thing happened to you
but if you partake of the sufferings of christ rejoice that when
his glory shall be revealed you may also be glad with exceeding joy
if you be reproached for the name of christ you shall be blessed
for that which is of the honour glory and power of god and that which
is his spirit resteth upon you
but let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a railer or
coveter of other mens things
but if as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him
glorify god in that name
for the time is that judgment should begin at the house of god
the gospel of god
and if the just man shall scarcely be saved where shall the
ungodly and the sinner appear
of the dangers which constantly surround the temptations of the world
of the devil and of our own corrupt nature
wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of god
commend their souls in good deeds to the faithful creator
recommends to all humility and watchfulness
the ancients therefore that are among you i beseech who am myself
also an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of christ as also a
partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come
feed the flock of god which is among you taking care of it not by
constraint but willingly according to god not for filthy lucres sake
but voluntarily
neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of
the flock from the heart
and when the prince of pastors shall appear you shall receive a
never fading crown of glory
in like manner ye young men be subject to the ancients and do
you all insinuate humility one to another for god resisteth the proud
but to the humble he giveth grace
be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may
exalt you in the time of visitation
casting all your care upon him for he hath care of you
be sober and watch because your adversary the devil as a roaring
lion goeth about seeking whom he may devour
whom resist ye strong in faith knowing that the same affliction
befalls your brethren who are in the world
but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal
glory in christ jesus after you have suffered a little will himself
perfect you and confirm you and establish you
to him be glory and empire for ever and ever amen
by sylvanus a faithful brother unto you as i think i have
written briefly beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace
of god wherein you stand
the church that is in babylon elected together with you saluteth
you and so doth my son mark
salute one another with a holy kiss grace be to all you who are
in christ jesus amen
write to you and before chap being assured that the laying away
of this my tabernacle is at hand this shews that it was written a very
short time before his martyrdom which was about thirtyfive years after
our lords ascension in this epistle he admonishes the faithful to be
mindful of the great gifts they received from god and to join all other
virtues with their faith he warns them against false teachers by
describing their practices and foretelling their punishments he
describes the dissolution of this world by fire and the day of judgment
secure their salvation
simon peter servant and apostle of jesus christ to them that have
obtained equal faith with us in the justice of our god and saviour jesus
grace to you and peace be accomplished in the knowledge of god and
of christ jesus our lord
as all things of his divine power which appertain to life and
godliness are given us through the knowledge of him who hath called us
by his own proper glory and virtue
by whom he hath given us most great and precious promises that by
these you may be made partakers of the divine nature flying the
corruption of that concupiscence which is in the world
and you employing all care minister in your faith virtue and in
virtue knowledge
and in knowledge abstinence and in abstinence patience and in
patience godliness
and in godliness love of brotherhood and in love of brotherhood
charity
for if these things be with you and abound they will make you to
be neither empty nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus
for he that hath not these things with him is blind and groping
having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins
wherefore brethren labour the more that by good works you may
make sure your calling and election for doing these things you shall
not sin at any time
for so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the
everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
for which cause i will begin to put you always in remembrance of
these things though indeed you know them and are confirmed in the
present truth
but i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir
you up by putting you in remembrance
being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at
hand according as our lord jesus christ also hath signified to me
and i will endeavour that you frequently have after my decease
whereby you may keep a memory of these things
for we have not by following artificial fables made known to you
the power and presence of our lord jesus christ but we were
eyewitnesses of his greatness
for he received from god the father honour and glory this voice
coming down to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in
whom i am well pleased hear ye him
and this voice we heard brought from heaven when we were with
him in the holy mount
and we have the more firm prophetical word whereunto you do well
to attend as to a light that shineth in a dark place until the day
dawn and the day star arise in your hearts
understanding this first that no prophecy of scripture is made by
private interpretation
shows plainly that the scriptures are not to be expounded by any ones
private judgment or private spirit because every part of the holy
scriptures were written by men inspired by the holy ghost and declared
as such by the church therefore they are not to be interpreted but by
the spirit of god which he hath left and promised to remain with his
us that many of our divines interpret the scriptures they may do so
but they do it always with a submission to the judgment of the church
and not otherwise
for prophecy came not by the will of man at any time but the holy
men of god spoke inspired by the holy ghost
but there were also false prophets among the people even as there
shall be among you lying teachers who shall bring in sects of perdition
and deny the lord who bought them bringing upon themselves swift
destruction
and many shall follow their riotousness through whom the way of
truth shall be evil spoken of
and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and
their perdition slumbereth not
for if god spared not the angels that sinned but delivered them
drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell unto torments to be
reserved unto judgment
and spared not the original world but preserved noe the eighth
person the preacher of justice bringing in the flood upon the world of
the ungodly
and reducing the cities of the sodomites and of the gomorrhites
into ashes condemned them to be overthrown making them an example to
those that should after act wickedly
and delivered just lot oppressed by the injustice and lewd
conversation of the wicked
for in sight and hearing he was just dwelling among them who from
day to day vexed the just soul with unjust works
the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation but to
reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented
and especially them who walk after the flesh in the lust of
uncleanness and despise government audacious self willed they fear
not to bring in sects blaspheming
whereas angels who are greater in strength and power bring not
against themselves a railing judgment
cursing sentence not even in their conflicts with the evil angels see
but these men as irrational beasts naturally tending to the
snare and to destruction blaspheming those things which they know not
shall perish in their corruption
receiving the reward of their injustice counting for a pleasure
the delights of a day stains and spots sporting themselves to excess
rioting in their feasts with you
which they place all their happiness
having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not alluring
unstable souls having their heart exercised with covetousness children
of malediction
leaving the right way they have gone astray having followed the
way of balaam of bosor who loved the wages of iniquity
but had a check of his madness the dumb beast used to the yoke
which speaking with mans voice forbade the folly of the prophet
these are fountains without water and clouds tossed with
whirlwinds to whom the mist of darkness is reserved
for speaking proud words of vanity they allure by the desires of
fleshly riotousness those who for a little while escape such as
converse in error
promising them liberty whereas they themselves are the slaves of
corruption for by whom a man is overcome of the same also he is the
slave
for if flying from the pollutions of the world through the
knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ they be again entangled
in them and overcome their latter state is become unto them worse than
the former
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of
justice than after they have known it to turn back from that holy
commandment which was delivered to them
for that of the true proverb has happened to them the dog is
returned to his vomit and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in
the mire
sudden dissolution of this world and exhorts to holiness of life
behold this second epistle i write to you my dearly beloved in
which i stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind
that you may be mindful of those words which i told you before from
the holy prophet and of your apostles of the precepts of the lord and
knowing this first that in the last days there shall come
deceitful scoffers walking after their own lusts
saying where is his promise or his coming for since the time that
the fathers slept all things continue as they were from the beginning
of the creation
for this they are wilfully ignorant of that the heavens were
before and the earth out of water and through water consisting by the
word of god
whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water
perished
but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are
kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of the ungodly men
but of this one thing be not ignorant my beloved that one day
with the lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day
the lord delayeth not his promise as some imagine but dealeth
patiently for your sake not willing that any should perish but that
all should return to penance
but the day of the lord shall come as a thief in which the
heavens shall pass away with great violence and the elements shall be
melted with heat and the earth and the works which are in it shall be
burnt up
seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved what manner
of people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness
looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the lord by
which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements
shall melt with the burning heat
but we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his
promises in which justice dwelleth
wherefore dearly beloved waiting for these things be diligent
that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace
and account the longsuffering of our lord salvation as also our
most dear brother paul according to the wisdom given him hath written
to you
as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in
which are certain things hard to be understood which the unlearned and
unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures to their own
destruction
you therefore brethren knowing these things before take heed
lest being led aside by the error of the unwise you fall from your own
steadfastness
but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour
runs throughout the gospel written by the beloved disciple and
principal mysteries of faith the mystery of the trinity and the mystery
of the incarnation of jesus christ the son of god the sublimity and
excellence of the evangelical doctrine he declares and this commandment
we have from god that he who loveth god love also his brother chap
and again for this is the charity of god that we keep his
commandments and his commandments are not heavy chap he shews
how to distinguish the children of god from those of the devil marks
out those who should be called antichrists describes the turpitude and
gravity of sin finally he shews how the sinner may hope for pardon it
was written according to baronius account sixtysix years after our
