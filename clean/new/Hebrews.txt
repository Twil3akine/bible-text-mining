incomparably greater than the angels
god who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in times
past to the fathers by the prophets last of all
in these days hath spoken to us by his son whom he hath appointed
heir of all things by whom also he made the world
who being the brightness of his glory and the figure of his
substance and upholding all things by the word of his power making
purgation of sins sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high
being made so much better than the angels as he hath inherited a
more excellent name than they
for to which of the angels hath he said at any time thou art my
and he shall be to me a son
and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world
he saith and let all the angels of god adore him
and to the angels indeed he saith he that maketh his angels
spirits and his ministers a flame of fire
but to the son thy throne o god is for ever and ever a sceptre
of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom
thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity therefore god thy god
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows
and thou in the beginning o lord didst found the earth and the
works of thy hands are the heavens
they shall perish but thou shalt continue and they shall all
grow old as a garment
and as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shalt be
changed but thou art the selfsame and thy years shall not fail
but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right
hand until i make thy enemies thy footstool
are they not all ministering spirits sent to minister for them
who shall receive the inheritance of salvation
condemnable than of those of the old testament given by angels
therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we
have heard lest perhaps we should let them slip
for if the word spoken by angels became steadfast and every
transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward
how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which having
begun to be declared by the lord was confirmed unto us by them that
heard him
god also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers
miracles and distributions of the holy ghost according to his own will
for god hath not subjected unto angels the world to come whereof
we speak
but one in a certain place hath testified saying what is man
that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him
thou hast made him a little lower than the angels thou hast
crowned him with glory and honour and hast set him over the works of thy
hands
thou hast subjected all things under his feet for in that he hath
subjected all things to him he left nothing not subject to him but now
we see not as yet all things subject to him
but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for
the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that through the
grace of god he might taste death for all
for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all
things who had brought many children into glory to perfect the author
of their salvation by his passion
glory luke which the apostle here calls being made perfect
for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all
of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying
i will declare thy name to my brethren in the midst of the church
will i praise thee
and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and my
children whom god hath given me
therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood
he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same that
through death he might destroy him who had the empire of death that is
to say the devil
and might deliver them who through the fear of death were all
their lifetime subject to servitude
for nowhere doth he take hold of the angels but of the seed of
angels but that of the seed of abraham
wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his
brethren that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest
before god that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people
for in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted he
is able to succour them also that are tempted
faith and obedience
wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly vocation
consider the apostle and high priest of our confession jesus
who is faithful to him that made him as was also moses in all his
house
for this man was counted worthy of greater glory than moses by so
much as he that hath built the house hath greater honour than the house
for every house is built by some man but he that created all
things is god
and moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant for a
testimony of those things which were to be said
but christ as the son in his own house which house are we if we
hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end
wherefore as the holy ghost saith today if you shall hear his
voice
harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of
temptation in the desert
where your fathers tempted me proved and saw my works
forty years for which cause i was offended with this generation
and i said they always err in heart and they have not known my ways
as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest
take heed brethren lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil
heart of unbelief to depart from the living god
but exhort one another every day whilst it is called to day that
none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
for we are made partakers of christ yet so if we hold the
beginning of his substance firm unto the end
while it is said to day if you shall hear his voice harden not
your hearts as in that provocation
for some who heard did provoke but not all that came out of egypt
by moses
and with whom was he offended forty years was it not with them
that sinned whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert
and to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his
rest but to them that were incredulous
and we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief
let us fear therefore lest the promise being left of entering into
his rest any of you should be thought to be wanting
for unto us also it hath been declared in like manner as unto them
of those things they heard
for we who have believed shall enter into rest as he said as i
have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest and this
indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished
for in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus and god
rested the seventh day from all his works
and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest
seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it and they
to whom it was first preached did not enter because of unbelief
again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after so
long a time as it is above said to day if you shall hear his voice
harden not your hearts
for if jesus had given them rest he would never have afterwards
spoken of another day
there remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of god
for he that is entered into his rest the same also hath rested
from his works as god did from his
let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall
into the same example of unbelief
for the word of god is living and effectual and more piercing than
any two edged sword and reaching unto the division of the soul and the
spirit of the joints also and the marrow and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart
neither is there any creature invisible in his sight but all
things are naked and open to his eyes to whom our speech is
having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the
heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our confession
for we have not a high priest who cannot have compassion on our
infirmities but one tempted in all things like as we are without sin
let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace that
we may obtain mercy and find grace in seasonable aid
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
the things that appertain to god that he may offer up gifts and
sacrifices for sins
who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err
because he himself also is compassed with infirmity
and therefore he ought as for the people so also for himself to
offer for sins
neither doth any man take the honour to himself but he that is
called by god as aaron was
so christ also did not glorify himself that he might be made a
high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son this day have i
begotten thee
as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for ever
according to the order of melchisedech
who in the days of his flesh with a strong cry and tears offering
up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from
death was heard for his reverence
and whereas indeed he was the son of god he learned obedience by
the things which he suffered
and being consummated he became to all that obey him the cause
of eternal salvation
called by god a high priest according to the order of
of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered
because you are become weak to hear
for whereas for the time you ought to be masters you have need to
be taught again what are the first elements of the words of god and you
are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat
for every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word
of justice for he is a little child
but strong meat is for the perfect for them who by custom have
their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil
patience and perseverance
wherefore leaving the word of the beginning of christ let us go
on to things more perfect not laying again the foundation of penance
from dead works and of faith towards god
doctrine
of the doctrine of baptisms and imposition of hands and of the
resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment
and this will we do if god permit
for it is impossible for those who were once illuminated have
tasted also the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost
as have fallen after baptism to be again baptized and very hard for
such as have apostatized from the faith after having received many
graces to return again to the happy state from which they fell
have moreover tasted the good word of god and the powers of the
world to come
and are fallen away to be renewed again to penance crucifying
again to themselves the son of god and making him a mockery
for the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it
and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled receiveth
blessing from god
but that which bringeth forth thorns and briers is reprobate and
very near unto a curse whose end is to be burnt
but my dearly beloved we trust better things of you and nearer
to salvation though we speak thus
for god is not unjust that he should forget your work and the
love which you have shewn in his name you who have ministered and do
minister to the saints
and we desire that every one of you shew forth the same
carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end
that you become not slothful but followers of them who through
faith and patience shall inherit the promises
for god making promises to abraham because he had no one greater
by whom he might swear swore by himself
saying unless blessing i shall bless thee and multiplying i shall
multiply thee
and so patiently enduring he obtained the promise
for men swear by one greater than themselves and an oath for
confirmation is the end of all their controversy
wherein god meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the
promise the immutability of his counsel interposed an oath
that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for god to
lie we may have the strongest comfort we who have fled for refuge to
hold fast the hope set before us
which we have as an anchor of the soul sure and firm and which
entereth in even within the veil
where the forerunner jesus is entered for us made a high priest
for ever according to the order of melchisedech
the levitical priesthood and puts an end both to that and to the law
for this melchisedech was king of salem priest of the most high
blessed him
to whom also abraham divided the tithes of all who first indeed by
interpretation is king of justice and then also king of salem that is
king of peace
without father without mother without genealogy having neither
beginning of days nor end of life but likened unto the son of god
continueth a priest for ever
his father nor his pedigree nor his birth nor his death are set down
in scripture
now consider how great this man is to whom also abraham the
patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things
and indeed they that are of the sons of levi who receive the
priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to
the law that is to say of their brethren though they themselves also
came out of the loins of abraham
but he whose pedigree is not numbered among them received tithes
of abraham and blessed him that had the promises
and without all contradiction that which is less is blessed by the
better
and here indeed men that die receive tithes but there he hath
witness that he liveth
and as it may be said even levi who received tithes paid tithes
in abraham
for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedech met
him
if then perfection was by the levitical priesthood for under it
the people received the law what further need was there that another
priest should rise according to the order of melchisedech and not be
called according to the order of aaron
for the priesthood being translated it is necessary that a
translation also be made of the law
for he of whom these things are spoken is of another tribe of
which no one attended on the altar
for it is evident that our lord sprung out of juda in which tribe
and it is yet far more evident if according to the similitude of
who is made not according to the law of a law of a carnal
commandment but according to the power of an indissoluble life
for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever according to the
order of melchisedech
there is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment because
of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof
for the law brought nothing to perfection but a bringing in of a
better hope by which we draw nigh to god
and inasmuch as it is not without an oath for the others indeed
were made priests without an oath
but this with an oath by him that said unto him the lord hath
sworn and he will not repent thou art a priest for ever
by so much is jesus made a surety of a better testament
and the others indeed were made many priests because by reason of
death they were not suffered to continue
priests of the law and our high priest jesus christ that they being
removed by death made way for their successors whereas our lord jesus
is a priest for ever and hath no successor but liveth and concurreth
for ever with his ministers the priests of the new testament in all
their functions also that no one priest of the law nor all of them
together could offer that absolute sacrifice of everlasting redemption
which our one high priest jesus christ has offered once and for ever
but this for that he continueth for ever hath an everlasting
priesthood
whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to god by
him always living to make intercession for us
us by representing his passion to his father
for it was fitting that we should have such a high priest holy
innocent undefiled separated from sinners and made higher than the
heavens
who needeth not daily as the other priests to offer sacrifices
first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once
in offering himself
for the law maketh men priests who have infirmity but the word
of the oath which was since the law the son who is perfected for
evermore
now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have
such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of
majesty in the heavens
a minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle which the lord
hath pitched and not man
for every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices
wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer
if then he were on earth he would not be a priest seeing that
there would be others to offer gifts according to the law
condition than the levitical order of earthly priests and had not
another kind of sacrifice to offer he should be excluded by them from
the priesthood and its functions which by the law were appropriated to
their tribe
who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as it was
answered to moses when he was to finish the tabernacle see saith he
that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee
on the mount
a kind of an example and shadow of what is done by christ in his church
militant and triumphant of which the tabernacle was a pattern
but now he hath obtained a better ministry by how much also he is
a mediator of a better testament which is established on better
promises
for if that former had been faultless there should not indeed a
place have been sought for a second
for finding fault with them he saith behold the days shall come
saith the lord and i will perfect unto the house of israel and unto
the house of juda a new testament
not according to the testament which i made to their fathers on
the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of
not saith the lord
for this is the testament which i will make to the house of israel
after those days saith the lord i will give my laws into their mind
and in their heart will i write them and i will be their god and they
shall be my people
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his
brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to
the greatest of them
new testament that it shall not be necessary to inculcate to the
faithful the belief and knowledge of the true god for they shall all
know him
because i will be merciful to their iniquities and their sins i
will remember no more
now in saying a new he hath made the former old and that which
decayeth and groweth old is near its end
the former indeed had also justifications of divine service and a
sanctuary
for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein were the
candlesticks and the table and the setting forth of loaves which is
called the holy
and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holy
of holies
having a golden censer and the ark of the testament covered about
on every part with gold in which was a golden pot that had manna and
the rod of aaron that had blossomed and the tables of the testament
and over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the
propitiatory of which it is not needful to speak now particularly
now these things being thus ordered into the first tabernacle the
priests indeed always entered accomplishing the offices of sacrifices
but into the second the high priest alone once a year not
without blood which he offereth for his own and the peoples ignorance
the holy ghost signifying this that the way into the holies was
not yet made manifest whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing
which is a parable of the time present according to which gifts
and sacrifices are offered which cannot as to the conscience make him
perfect that serveth only in meats and in drinks
and divers washings and justices of the flesh laid on them until
the time of correction
but christ being come an high priest of the good things to come
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand that is
not of this creation
neither by the blood of goats or of calves but by his own blood
entered once into the holies having obtained eternal redemption
on the cross christ our lord paid and exhibited once for all the
general price and ransom of all mankind which no other priest could do
for if the blood of goats and of oxen and the ashes of an heifer
being sprinkled sanctify such as are defiled to the cleansing of the
flesh
how much more shall the blood of christ who by the holy ghost
offered himself unspotted unto god cleanse our conscience from dead
works to serve the living god
and therefore he is the mediator of the new testament that by
means of his death for the redemption of those transgressions which were
under the former testament they that are called may receive the promise
of eternal inheritance
for where there is a testament the death of the testator must of
necessity come in
for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is as
yet of no strength whilst the testator liveth
whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood
for when every commandment of the law had been read by moses to
all the people he took the blood of calves and goats with water and
scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the
people
saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined
unto you
the tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry in like
manner he sprinkled with blood
and almost all things according to the law are cleansed with
blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission
it is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things
should be cleansed with these but the heavenly things themselves with
better sacrifices than these
for jesus is not entered into the holies made with hands the
patterns of the true but into heaven itself that he may appear now in
the presence of god for us
nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest
entereth into the holies every year with the blood of others
sacrifice in that violent painful and bloody manner nor can there be
any occasion for it since by that one sacrifice upon the cross he has
furnished the full ransom redemption and remedy for all the sins of
the world but this hinders not that he may offer himself daily in the
sacred mysteries in an unbloody manner for the daily application of
that one sacrifice of redemption to our souls
for then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the
world but now once at the end of ages he hath appeared for the
destruction of sin by the sacrifice of himself
and as it is appointed unto men once to die and after this the
judgment
so also christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many the
second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto
salvation
plentiful and perfect redemption
high priest shed his own blood for us offering up once for all the
sacrifice of our redemption he exhorts them to perseverance
for the law having a shadow of the good things to come not the
very image of the things by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer
continually every year can never make the comers thereunto perfect
for then they would have ceased to be offered because the
worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer
the intents of redemption and remission as christs death is there
would have been no occasion of so often repeating them as there is no
occasion for christs dying any more for our sins
but in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year
for it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin
should be taken away
wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and
oblation thou wouldest not but a body thou hast fitted to me
holocausts for sin did not please thee
then said i behold i come in the head of the book it is written
of me that i should do thy will o god
in saying before sacrifices and oblations and holocausts for
sin thou wouldest not neither are they pleasing to thee which are
offered according to the law
then said i behold i come to do thy will o god he taketh away
the first that he may establish that which followeth
in the which will we are sanctified by the oblation of the body
of jesus christ once
and every priest indeed standeth daily ministering and often
offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins
but this man offering one sacrifice for sins for ever sitteth
on the right hand of god
from henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his
footstool
for by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified
and the holy ghost also doth testify this to us for after that
he said
and this is the testament which i will make unto them after those
days saith the lord i will give my laws in their hearts and on their
minds will i write them
and their sins and iniquities i will remember no more
now where there is a remission of these there is no more an
oblation for sin
of sins as in baptism there is no more occasion for a sin offering to
be made for such sins already remitted and as for sins committed
afterwards they can only be remitted in virtue of the one oblation of
having therefore brethren a confidence in the entering into the
holies by the blood of christ
a new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the
veil that is to say his flesh
and a high priest over the house of god
let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith having
our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with
clean water
let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for
he is faithful that hath promised
and let us consider one another to provoke unto charity and to
good works
not forsaking our assembly as some are accustomed but
comforting one another and so much the more as you see the day
approaching
for if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth
there is now left no sacrifice for sins
known truth after which as we can not be baptized again we can not
expect to have that abundant remission of sins which christ purchased
by his death applied to our souls in that ample manner as it is in
baptism but we have rather all manner of reason to look for a dreadful
judgment the more because apostates from the known truth seldom or
never have the grace to return to it
but a certain dreadful expectation of judgment and the rage of a
fire which shall consume the adversaries
a man making void the law of moses dieth without any mercy under
two or three witnesses
how much more do you think he deserveth worse punishments who
hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath esteemed the blood of
the testament unclean by which he was sanctified and hath offered an
affront to the spirit of grace
for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth to me and i
will repay and again the lord shall judge his people
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
but call to mind the former days wherein being illuminated you
endured a great fight of afflictions
and on the one hand indeed by reproaches and tribulations were
made a gazingstock and on the other became companions of them that
were used in such sort
for you both had compassion on them that were in bands and took
with joy the being stripped of your own goods knowing that you have a
better and a lasting substance
do not therefore lose your confidence which hath a great reward
for patience is necessary for you that doing the will of god
you may receive the promise
for yet a little and a very little while and he that is to come
will come and will not delay
but my just man liveth by faith but if he withdraw himself he
shall not please my soul
but we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition but of
faith to the saving of the soul
fathers
now faith is the substance of things to be hoped for the
evidence of things that appear not
for by this the ancients obtained a testimony
by faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of
by faith abel offered to god a sacrifice exceeding that of cain
by which he obtained a testimony that he was just god giving testimony
to his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh
by faith henoch was translated that he should not see death and
he was not found because god had translated him for before his
translation he had testimony that he pleased god
but without faith it is impossible to please god for he that
cometh to god must believe that he is and is a rewarder to them that
seek him
by faith noe having received an answer concerning those things
which as yet were not seen moved with fear framed the ark for the
saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and was
instituted heir of the justice which is by faith
by faith he that is called abraham obeyed to go out into a place
which he was to receive for an inheritance and he went out not knowing
whither he went
by faith he abode in the land of promise as in a strange country
dwelling in cottages with isaac and jacob the coheirs of the same
promise
for he looked for a city that hath foundations whose builder and
maker is god
by faith also sara herself being barren received strength to
conceive seed even past the time of age because she believed that he
was faithful who had promised
for which cause there sprung even from one and him as good as
dead as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand which is by
the sea shore innumerable
all these died according to faith not having received the
promises but beholding them afar off and saluting them and confessing
that they are pilgrims and strangers on the earth
for they that say these things do signify that they seek a
country
and truly if they had been mindful of that from whence they came
out they had doubtless time to return
but now they desire a better that is to say a heavenly country
prepared for them a city
by faith abraham when he was tried offered isaac and he that
had received the promises offered up his only begotten son
to whom it was said in isaac shalt thy seed be called
accounting that god is able to raise up even from the dead
life again
by faith also of things to come isaac blessed jacob and esau
by faith jacob dying blessed each of the sons of joseph and
adored the top of his rod
honour and veneration to the top of the rod or sceptre of joseph as to
a figure of christs sceptre and kingdom as an instance and argument of
his faith but some translators who are no friends to this relative
honour have corrupted the text by translating it he worshipped
leaning upon the top of his staff as if this circumstance of leaning
upon his staff were any argument of jacobs faith or worthy the being
thus particularly taken notice of by the holy ghost
by faith joseph when he was dying made mention of the going out
of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones
by faith moses when he was born was hid three months by his
parents because they saw he was a comely babe and they feared not the
kings edict
by faith moses when he was grown up denied himself to be the
son of pharaos daughter
rather choosing to be afflicted with the people of god than to
have the pleasure of sin for a time
esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasure
of the egyptians for he looked unto the reward
by faith he left egypt not fearing the fierceness of the king
for he endured as seeing him that is invisible
by faith he celebrated the pasch and the shedding of the blood
that he who destroyed the firstborn might not touch them
by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land which
the egyptians attempting were swallowed up
by faith the walls of jericho fell down by the going round them
seven days
by faith rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers
receiving the spies with peace
and what shall i yet say for the time would fail me to tell of
who by faith conquered kingdoms wrought justice obtained
promises stopped the mouths of lions
quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword
recovered strength from weakness became valiant in battle put to
flight the armies of foreigners
women received their dead raised to life again but others were
racked not accepting deliverance that they might find a better
resurrection
and others had trial of mockeries and stripes moreover also of
bands and prisons
they were stoned they were cut asunder they were tempted they
were put to death by the sword they wandered about in sheepskins in
goatskins being in want distressed afflicted
of whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts in
mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth
and all these being approved by the testimony of faith received
not the promise
god providing some better thing for us that they should not be
perfected without us
graces of the new testament
and therefore we also having so great a cloud of witnesses over
our head laying aside every weight and sin which surrounds us let us
run by patience to the fight proposed to us
looking on jesus the author and finisher of faith who having
joy set before him endured the cross despising the shame and now
sitteth on the right hand of the throne of god
for think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from
sinners against himself that you be not wearied fainting in your minds
for you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin
and you have forgotten the consolation which speaketh to you as
unto children saying my son neglect not the discipline of the lord
neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by him
for whom the lord loveth he chastiseth and he scourgeth every son
whom he receiveth
persevere under discipline god dealeth with you as with his sons
but if you be without chastisement whereof all are made
partakers then are you bastards and not sons
moreover we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors and we
reverenced them shall we not much more obey the father of spirits and
live
and they indeed for a few days according to their own pleasure
instructed us but he for our profit that we might receive his
sanctification
now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring
with it joy but sorrow but afterwards it will yield to them that are
exercised by it the most peaceable fruit of justice
wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble
knees
and make straight steps with your feet that no one halting may
go out of the way but rather be healed
follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man
shall see god
looking diligently lest any man be wanting to the grace of god
lest any root of bitterness springing up do hinder and by it many be
defiled
lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for
one mess sold his first birthright
for know ye that afterwards when he desired to inherit the
benediction he was rejected for he found no place of repentance
although with tears he had sought it
or change his mind with relation to his having given the blessing to
his younger brother jacob
for you are not come to a mountain that might be touched and a
burning fire and a whirlwind and darkness and storm
and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which they
that had excused themselves that the word might not be spoken to them
for they did not endure that which was said and if so much as a
beast shall touch the mount it shall be stoned
and so terrible was that which was seen moses said i am
frighted and tremble
but you are come to mount sion and to the city of the living god
the heavenly jerusalem and to the company of many thousands of angels
and to the church of the firstborn who are written in the
heavens and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of the just
made perfect
and to jesus the mediator of the new testament and to the
sprinkling of blood which speaketh better than that of abel
see that you refuse him not that speaketh for if they escaped
not who refused him that spoke upon earth much more shall not we that
turn away from him that speaketh to us from heaven
whose voice then moved the earth but now he promiseth saying
and in that he saith yet once more he signifieth the
translation of the moveable things as made that those things may remain
which are immoveable
therefore receiving an immoveable kingdom we have grace
whereby let us serve pleasing god with fear and reverence
for our god is a consuming fire
let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you
and hospitality do not forget for by this some being not aware
of it have entertained angels
remember them that are in bands as if you were bound with them
and them that labour as being yourselves also in the body
marriage honourable in all and the bed undefiled for fornicators
and adulterers god will judge
belonging to the marriage state this is a warning to married people
not to abuse the sanctity of their state by any liberties or
irregularities contrary thereunto now it does not follow from this text
that all persons are obliged to marry even if the word omnibus were
rendered in all persons instead of in all things for if it was a
precept st paul himself would have transgressed it as he never
married moreover those who have already made a vow to god to lead a
single life should they attempt to marry they would incur their own
damnation tim
let your manners be without covetousness contented with such
things as you have for he hath said i will not leave thee neither
will i forsake thee
so that we may confidently say the lord is my helper i will not
fear what man shall do to me
remember your prelates who have spoken the word of god to you
whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation
jesus christ yesterday and today and the same for ever
be not led away with various and strange doctrines for it is best
that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not
profited those that walk in them
we have an altar whereof they have no power to eat who serve the
tabernacle
for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the
holies by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp
wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people by his
own blood suffered without the gate
let us go forth therefore to him without the camp bearing his
reproach
reproach that is bearing his cross it is an exhortation to them to
be willing to suffer with christ reproaches persecutions and even
death if they desire to partake of the benefit of his suffering for
mans redemption
for we have not here a lasting city but we seek one that is to
come
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to
and do not forget to do good and to impart for by such
sacrifices gods favour is obtained
obey your prelates and be subject to them for they watch as
being to render an account of your souls that they may do this with joy
and not with grief for this is not expedient for you
pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience being
willing to behave ourselves well in all things
and i beseech you the more to do this that i may be restored to
you the sooner
and may the god of peace who brought again from the dead the
great pastor of the sheep our lord jesus christ in the blood of the
everlasting testament
fit you in all goodness that you may do his will doing in you
that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom
is glory for ever and ever amen
and i beseech you brethren that you suffer this word of
consolation for i have written to you in a few words
know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty with whom if
he come shortly i will see you
salute all your prelates and all the saints the brethren from
grace be with you all amen
two epistles of st peter the first of st john and that of st jude
because they were not written to any peculiar people or particular
person but to the faithful in general it was written by the apostle
being his kinsman for cousins german with the hebrews were called
brothers he was the first bishop of jerusalem in this epistle are set
forth many precepts appertaining to faith and morals particularly that
faith without good works will not save a man and that true wisdom is
given only from above in the fifth chapter he publishes the sacrament
of anointing the sick it was written a short time before his martyrdom
about twentyeight years after our lords ascension
