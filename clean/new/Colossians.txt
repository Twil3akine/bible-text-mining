them christ is the head of the church and the peacemaker through his
blood paul is his minister
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy
a brother
to the saints and faithful brethren in christ jesus who are at
grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord
hearing your faith in christ jesus and the love which you have
towards all the saints
for the hope that is laid up for you in heaven which you have
heard in the word of the truth of the gospel
which is come unto you as also it is in the whole world and
bringeth forth fruit and groweth even as it doth in you since the day
you heard and knew the grace of god in truth
as you learned of epaphras our most beloved fellow servant who is
for you a faithful minister of christ jesus
who also hath manifested your love in the spirit
therefore we also from the day that we heard it cease not to pray
for you and to beg that you may be filled with the knowledge of his
will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding
that you may walk worthy of god in all things pleasing being
fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god
strengthened with all might according to the power of his glory
in all patience and longsuffering with joy
giving thanks to god the father who hath made us worthy to be
partakers of the lot of the saints in light
who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath
translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love
in whom we have redemption through his blood the remission of
sins
who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every
creature
the only begotten of his father hence st chrisostom explains
firstborn not first created as he was not created at all but born of
his father before all ages that is coeval with the father and with the
for in him were all things created in heaven and on earth visible
and invisible whether thrones or dominations or principalities or
powers all things were created by him and in him
and he is before all and by him all things consist
and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning
the firstborn from the dead that in all things he may hold the primacy
because in him it hath well pleased the father that all fulness
should dwell
and through him to reconcile all things unto himself making peace
through the blood of his cross both as to the things that are on earth
and the things that are in heaven
and you whereas you were some time alienated and enemies in mind
in evil works
yet now he hath reconciled in the body of his flesh through death
to present you holy and unspotted and blameless before him
if so ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and
immoveable from the hope of the gospel which you have heard which is
preached in all the creation that is under heaven whereof i paul am
made a minister
who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things
that are wanting of the sufferings of christ in my flesh for his body
which is the church
head but many sufferings are still wanting or are still to come in
his body the church and his members the faithful
whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god
which is given me towards you that i may fulfil the word of god
the mystery which hath been hidden from ages and generations but
now is manifested to his saints
to whom god would make known the riches of the glory of this
mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory
whom we preach admonishing every man and teaching every man in
all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus
wherein also i labour striving according to his working which he
worketh in me in power
teachers that would withdraw them from christ
for i would have you know what manner of care i have for you and
for them that are at laodicea and whosoever have not seen my face in the
flesh
that their hearts may be comforted being instructed in charity and
unto all riches of fulness of understanding unto the knowledge of the
mystery of god the father and of christ jesus
in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
now this i say that no man may deceive you by loftiness of words
for though i be absent in body yet in spirit i am with you
rejoicing and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith
which is in christ
as therefore you have received jesus christ the lord walk ye in
him
rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the faith as also you
have learned abounding in him in thanksgiving
beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit
according to the tradition of men according to the elements of the world
and not according to christ
for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead corporeally
and you are filled in him who is the head of all principality and
power
in whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by
hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh but in the circumcision of
buried with him in baptism in whom also you are risen again by
the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him up from the dead
and you when you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of
your flesh he hath quickened together with him forgiving you all
offences
blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us
which was contrary to us and he hath taken the same out of the way
fastening it to the cross
and despoiling the principalities and powers he hath exposed them
confidently in open shew triumphing over them in himself
let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect
of a festival day or of the new moon or of the sabbaths
distinction of clean and unclean meats and of their festivals new
moons and sabbaths as being no longer obligatory
which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ
let no man seduce you willing in humility and religion of angels
walking in the things which he hath not seen in vain puffed up by the
sense of his flesh
worship falsely pretending humility but really proceeding from pride
as carriers of intelligence betwixt god and men pretending humility in
so doing as if god was too great to be addressed by men and setting
aside the mediatorship of jesus christ who is the head both of angels
and men such also was the worship paid by the ancient heretics
disciples of simon and menander to the angels whom they believed to be
makers and lords of this lower world this is certain that they whom
the apostle here condemns did not hold the head ver that is
way touches the catholic doctrine and practice of desiring our good
angels to pray to god for us through jesus christ st jerome epist
ad algas understands by the religion or service of angels the jewish
teachers who sought to subject the new christians to the observance of
the mosaic law
and not holding the head from which the whole body by joints and
bands being supplied with nourishment and compacted groweth into the
increase of god
if then you be dead with christ from the elements of this world
why do you yet decree as though living in the world
touch not taste not handle not
themselves either to the ordinances of the old law forbidding touching
or tasting things unclean or to the superstitious invention of
heretics imposing such restraints under pretence of wisdom humility
or mortification
which all are unto destruction by the very use according to the
precepts and doctrines of men
which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and
humility and not sparing the body not in any honour to the filling of
the flesh
duties of wives and husbands children and servants
therefore if you be risen with christ seek the things that are
above where christ is sitting at the right hand of god
mind the things that are above not the things that are upon the
earth
for you are dead and your life is hid with christ in god
when christ shall appear who is your life then you also shall
appear with him in glory
mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth
fornication uncleanness lust evil concupiscence and covetousness
which is the service of idols
for which things the wrath of god cometh upon the children of
unbelief
in which you also walked some time when you lived in them
but now put you also all away anger indignation malice
blasphemy filthy speech out of your mouth
lie not one to another stripping yourselves of the old man with
his deeds
and putting on the new him who is renewed unto knowledge
according to the image of him that created him
where there is neither gentile nor jew circumcision nor
uncircumcision barbarian nor scythian bond nor free but christ is all
and in all
put ye on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved the
bowels of mercy benignity humility modesty patience
bearing with one another and forgiving one another if any have a
complaint against another even as the lord hath forgiven you so do you
also
but above all these things have charity which is the bond of
perfection
and let the peace of christ rejoice in your hearts wherein also
you are called in one body and be ye thankful
let the word of christ dwell in you abundantly in all wisdom
teaching and admonishing one another in psalms hymns and spiritual
canticles singing in grace in your hearts to god
all whatsoever you do in word or in work do all in the name of
the lord jesus christ giving thanks to god and the father by him
wives be subject to your husbands as it behoveth in the lord
husbands love your wives and be not bitter towards them
children obey your parents in all things for this is well
pleasing to the lord
fathers provoke not your children to indignation lest they be
discouraged
servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh
not serving to the eye as pleasing men but in simplicity of heart
fearing god
whatsoever you do do it from the heart as to the lord and not
to men
knowing that you shall receive of the lord the reward of
inheritance serve ye the lord christ
for he that doth wrong shall receive for that which he hath done
wrongfully and there is no respect of persons with god
masters do to your servants that which is just and equal knowing
that you also have a master in heaven
be instant in prayer watching in it with thanksgiving
praying withal for us also that god may open unto us a door of
speech to speak the mystery of christ for which also i am bound
that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak
walk with wisdom towards them that are without redeeming the time
let your speech be always in grace seasoned with salt that you may
know how you ought to answer every man
all the things that concern me tychicus our dearest brother and
faithful minister and fellow servant in the lord will make known to
you
what i have sent to you for this same purpose that he may know the
things that concern you and comfort your hearts
with onesimus a most beloved and faithful brother who is one of
you all things that are done here they shall make known to you
aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you and mark the
cousin german of barnabas touching whom you have received commandments
and jesus that is called justus who are of the circumcision
comfort to me
epaphras saluteth you who is one of you a servant of christ
perfect and full in all the will of god
for i bear him testimony that he hath much labour for you and for
them that are at laodicea and them at hierapolis
luke the most dear physician saluteth you and demas
salute the brethren who are at laodicea and nymphas and the
church that is in his house
and when this epistle shall have been read with you cause that it
be read also in the church of the laodiceans and that you read that
which is of the laodiceans
was is uncertain and annotators have given different opinions
concerning it some expound these words of an epistle which st paul
wrote to the laodiceans and is since lost for that now extant is no
more than a collection of sentences out of the other epistles of st
probable that st paul wrote an epistle from rome to the laodiceans
about the same time that he wrote to the colossians as he had them both
equally at heart and that he ordered that epistle to be read by the
might communicate to each other what they had received from him as one
epistle might contain some matters not related in the other and would
be equally useful for their concern and more particularly as they were
equally disturbed by intruders and false teachers against which the
apostle was anxious to warn them lest they should be infected by their
pernicious doctrine
and say to archippus take heed to the ministry which thou hast
received in the lord that thou fulfil it
the salutation of paul with my own hand be mindful of my bands
preached the gospel converted some jews and a great number of the
commotion against him that he and his companion sylvanus were obliged
to quit the city afterwards he went to athens where he heard that the
converts in thessalonica were under a severe persecution ever since his
departure and lest they should lose their fortitude he sent timothy to
strengthen and comfort them in their sufferings in the meantime st
second to the thessalonians both in the same year being the nineteenth
after our lords ascension these are the first of his epistles in the
order of time
