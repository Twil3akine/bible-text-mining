paul and sylvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians
in god the father and in the lord jesus christ
grace be to you and peace we give thanks to god always for you
all making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing
being mindful of the work of your faith and labour and charity and
of the enduring of the hope of our lord jesus christ before god and our
knowing brethren beloved of god your election
for our gospel hath not been unto you in word only but in power
also and in the holy ghost and in much fulness as you know what manner
of men we have been among you for your sakes
and you became followers of us and of the lord receiving the word
in much tribulation with joy of the holy ghost
so that you were made a pattern to all that believe in macedonia
and in achaia
for from you was spread abroad the word of the lord not only in
towards god is gone forth so that we need not to speak any thing
for they themselves relate of us what manner of entering in we had
unto you and how you turned to god from idols to serve the living and
true god
and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised up from the
dead jesus who hath delivered us from the wrath to come
receiving it
for yourselves know brethren our entrance in unto you that it
was not in vain
but having suffered many things before and been shamefully treated
as you know at philippi we had confidence in our god to speak unto
you the gospel of god in much carefulness
for our exhortation was not of error nor of uncleanness nor in
deceit
but as we were approved by god that the gospel should be committed
to us even so we speak not as pleasing men but god who proveth our
hearts
for neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery as you
know nor taken an occasion of covetousness god is witness
nor sought we glory of men neither of you nor of others
whereas we might have been burdensome to you as the apostles of
should cherish her children
so desirous of you we would gladly impart unto you not only the
gospel of god but also our own souls because you were become most dear
unto us
for you remember brethren our labour and toil working night and
day lest we should be chargeable to any of you we preached among you
the gospel of god
you are witnesses and god also how holily and justly and without
blame we have been to you that have believed
as you know in what manner entreating and comforting you as a
father doth his children
we testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of
therefore we also give thanks to god without ceasing because
that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of god you
received it not as the word of men but as it is indeed the word of
for you brethren are become followers of the churches of god
which are in judea in christ jesus for you also have suffered the same
things from your own countrymen even as they have from the jews
who both killed the lord jesus and the prophets and have
persecuted us and please not god and are adversaries to all men
prohibiting us to speak to the gentiles that they may be saved
to fill up their sins always for the wrath of god is come upon them to
the end
after which gods justice would punish them for the wrath of god is
come upon them to the end that is to continue on them to the end
but we brethren being taken away from you for a short time in
sight not in heart have hastened the more abundantly to see your face
with great desire
for we would have come unto you i paul indeed once and again
but satan hath hindered us
for what is our hope or joy or crown of glory are not you in the
presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming
for you are our glory and joy
for which cause forbearing no longer we thought it good to remain
at athens alone
and we sent timothy our brother and the minister of god in the
gospel of christ to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith
that no man should be moved in these tribulations for yourselves
know that we are appointed thereunto
for even when we were with you we foretold you that we should
suffer tribulations as also it is come to pass and you know
for this cause also i forbearing no longer sent to know your
faith lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you and our
labour should be made vain
but now when timothy came to us from you and related to us your
faith and charity and that you have a good remembrance of us always
desiring to see us as we also to see you
therefore we were comforted brethren in you in all our necessity
and tribulation by your faith
because now we live if you stand in the lord
for what thanks can we return to god for you in all the joy
wherewith we rejoice for you before our god
night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face
and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith
now god himself and our father and our lord jesus christ direct
our way unto you
and may the lord multiply you and make you abound in charity
towards one another and towards all men as we do also towards you
to confirm your hearts without blame in holiness before god and
our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints
resurrection of the dead
for the rest therefore brethren pray and beseech you in the lord
please god so also you would walk that you may abound the more
for you know what precepts i have given to you by the lord jesus
for this is the will of god your sanctification that you should
abstain from fornication
that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour
not in the passion of lust like the gentiles that know not god
and that no man overreach nor circumvent his brother in business
because the lord is the avenger of all these things as we have told you
before and have testified
for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto
sanctification
therefore he that despiseth these things despiseth not man but
but as touching the charity of brotherhood we have no need to
write to you for yourselves have learned of god to love one another
for indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all macedonia
and that you use your endeavour to be quiet and that you do your
own business and work with your own hands as we commanded you and that
you walk honestly towards them that are without and that you want
nothing of any mans
and we will not have you ignorant brethren concerning them that
are asleep that you be not sorrowful even as others who have no hope
for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them who
have slept through jesus will god bring with him
for this we say unto you in the word of the lord that we who are
alive who remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them
who have slept
for the lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment
and with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of god and the
dead who are in christ shall rise first
then we who are alive who are left shall be taken up together
with them in the clouds to meet christ into the air and so shall we be
always with the lord
wherefore comfort ye one another with these words
several duties
but of the times and moments brethren you need not that we
should write to you
for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord shall so
come as a thief in the night
for when they shall say peace and security then shall sudden
destruction come upon them as the pains upon her that is with child
and they shall not escape
but you brethren are not in darkness that the day should
overtake you as a thief
for all you are the children of light and children of the day we
are not of the night nor of darkness
therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be
sober
for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunk
are drunk in the night
but let us who are of the day be sober having on the breast
plate of faith and charity and for a helmet the hope of salvation
for god hath not appointed us unto wrath but unto the purchasing
of salvation by our lord jesus christ
who died for us that whether we watch or sleep we may live
together with him
for which cause comfort one another and edify one another as you
also do
and we beseech you brethren to know them who labour among you
and are over you in the lord and admonish you
that you esteem them more abundantly in charity for their works
sake have peace with them
and we beseech you brethren rebuke the unquiet comfort the
feeble minded support the weak be patient towards all men
see that none render evil for evil to any man but ever follow
that which is good towards each other and towards all men
always rejoice
pray without ceasing
in all things give thanks for this is the will of god in christ
extinguish not the spirit
despise not prophecies
but prove all things hold fast that which is good
from all appearance of evil refrain yourselves
and may the god of peace himself sanctify you in all things that
your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless in the
coming of our lord jesus christ
he is faithful who hath called you who also will do it
brethren pray for us
salute all the brethren with a holy kiss
i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read to all the holy
brethren
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen
the faith of christ and not to be terrified by the insinuations of false
teachers telling them that the day of judgment was near at hand as
there must come many signs and wonders before it he bids them to hold
firm the traditions received from him whether by word or by epistle
and shews them how they may be certain of his letters by the manner he
writes
advancement in all good
paul and sylvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians
grace unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord
we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren as it
is fitting because your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of
every one of you towards each other aboundeth
so that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of god for
your patience and faith and in all your persecutions and tribulations
which you endure
for an example of the just judgment of god that you may be counted
worthy of the kingdom of god for which also you suffer
seeing it is a just thing with god to repay tribulation to them
that trouble you
and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus
shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power
in a flame of fire giving vengeance to them who know not god and
who obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
who shall suffer eternal punishment in destruction from the face
of the lord and from the glory of his power
when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be made
wonderful in all them who have believed because our testimony was
believed upon you in that day
wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would make you
worthy of his vocation and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness
and the work of faith in power
that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you
in him according to the grace of our god and of the lord jesus christ
apostles traditions are to be observed
and we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus
that you be not easily moved from your sense nor be terrified
neither by spirit nor by word nor by epistle as sent from us as if the
day of the lord were at hand
let no man deceive you by any means for unless there come a revolt
first and the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition
ancient fathers of a revolt from the roman empire which was first to
be destroyed before the coming of antichrist it may perhaps be
understood also of a revolt of many nations from the catholic church
which has in part happened already by means of mahomet luther c
and it may be supposed will be more general in the days of the
as is evident from the frequent repetition of the greek article the
man of sin the son of perdition the adversary or opposer it agrees to
the wicked and great antichrist who will come before the end of the
world
who opposeth and is lifted up above all that is called god or that
is worshipped so that he sitteth in the temple of god shewing himself
as if he were god
rebuild or in some christian church which he will pervert to his own
worship as mahomet has done by the churches of the east
remember you not that when i was yet with you i told you these
things
and now you know what withholdeth that he may be revealed in his
time
for the mystery of iniquity already worketh only that he who now
holdeth do hold until he be taken out of the way
and then that wicked one shall be revealed whom the lord jesus
shall kill with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming him
whose coming is according to the working of satan in all power and
signs and lying wonders
and in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish because they
receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved therefore
wonders and false miracles in punishment of their not entertaining the
love of truth
that all may be judged who have not believed the truth but have
consented to iniquity
but we ought to give thanks to god always for you brethren
beloved of god for that god hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation
in sanctification of the spirit and faith of the truth
whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel unto the
purchasing of the glory of our lord jesus christ
therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which
you have learned whether by word or by our epistle
received than their epistles
now our lord jesus christ himself and god and our father who
hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope in
grace
exhort your hearts and confirm you in every good work and word
for the rest brethren pray for us that the word of god may run
and may be glorified even as among you
and that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men for all
men have not faith
but god is faithful who will strengthen and keep you from evil
and we have confidence concerning you in the lord that the things
which we command you both do and will do
and the lord direct your hearts in the charity of god and the
patience of christ
and we charge you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ
that you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly and
not according to the tradition which they have received of us
for yourselves know how you ought to imitate us for we were not
disorderly among you
neither did we eat any mans bread for nothing but in labour and
in toil we worked night and day lest we should be chargeable to any of
you
not as if we had not power but that we might give ourselves a
pattern unto you to imitate us
for also when we were with you this we declared to you that if
any man will not work neither let him eat
for we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly
working not at all but curiously meddling
now we charge them that are such and beseech them by the lord
but you brethren be not weary in well doing
and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man
and do not keep company with him that he may be ashamed
yet do not esteem him as an enemy but admonish him as a brother
now the lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every
place the lord be with you all
the salutation of paul with my own hand which is the sign in
every epistle so i write
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
himself and to his charge and that he ought to be well informed of the
good morals of those on whom he was to impose hands impose not hands
lightly upon any man he tells him also how he should behave towards his
clergy the epistle was written about years after our lords
opinion is that it was in macedonia
