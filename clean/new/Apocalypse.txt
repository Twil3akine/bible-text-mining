the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to make
known to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass and
signified sending by his angel to his servant john
time is at hand this can not be meant of all the things prophesied in
the apocalypse where mention is made also of the day of judgment and
of the glory of heaven at the end of the world that some things were to
come to pass shortly is evident by what is said to the seven churches
chap and or that the persecutions foretold should begin shortly
coming of christ we are now in the last age or last hour see john

i john your brother and your partner in tribulation and in the
kingdom and patience in christ jesus was in the island which is called
i was in the spirit on the lords day and heard behind me a great
voice as of a trumpet
saying what thou seest write in a book and send to the seven
churches which are in asia to ephesus and to smyrna and to pergamus and
to thyatira and to sardis and to philadelphia and to laodicea
and i turned to see the voice that spoke with me and being
turned i saw seven golden candlesticks
and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like to the
paps with a golden girdle
and his head and his hairs were white as white wool and as snow
and his feet like unto fine brass as in a burning furnace and
his voice as the sound of many waters
and he had in his right hand seven stars and from his mouth came
out a sharp twoedged sword and his face was as the sun shineth in his
power
and when i had seen him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid
his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last
and alive and was dead and behold i am living for ever and ever
and have the keys of death and of hell
write therefore the things which thou hast seen and which are
and which must be done hereafter
the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand
and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the
seven churches and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches
unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith
he who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the
midst of the seven golden candlesticks
i know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst
not bear them that are evil and thou hast tried them who say they are
apostles and are not and hast found them liars
and thou hast patience and hast endured for my name and hast not
fainted
but i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first
charity
be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen and do penance
and do the first works or else i come to thee and will move thy
candlestick out of its place except thou do penance
but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaites
which i also hate

churches to him that overcometh i will give to eat of the tree of life
which is in the paradise of my god
and to the angel of the church of smyrna write these things saith
the first and the last who was dead and is alive
i know thy tribulation and thy poverty but thou art rich and
thou art blasphemed by them that say they are jews and are not but are
the synagogue of satan
fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the
devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you
shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will
give thee the crown of life

i know where thou dwellest where the seat of satan is and thou
holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days
when antipas was my faithful witness who was slain among you where
but i have against thee a few things because thou hast there them
that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a
stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat and to commit
fornication
so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaites
in like manner do penance if not i will come to thee quickly and
will fight against them with the sword of my mouth
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the
churches to him that overcometh i will give the hidden manna and will
give him a white counter and in the counter a new name written which
no man knoweth but he that receiveth it
and to the angel of the church of thyatira write these things
saith the son of god who hath his eyes like to a flame of fire and his
feet like to fine brass
i know thy works and thy faith and thy charity and thy ministry
and thy patience and thy last works which are more than the former
but i have against thee a few things because thou sufferest the
woman jezabel who calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce
my servants to commit fornication and to eat of things sacrificed to
idols
and i gave her a time that she might do penance and she will not
repent of her fornication
behold i will cast her into a bed and they that commit adultery
with her shall be in very great tribulation except they do penance from
their deeds
and i will kill her children with death and all the churches
shall know that i am he that searcheth the reins and hearts and i will
give to every one of you according to your works but to you i say
and to the rest who are at thyatira whosoever have not this
doctrine and who have not known the depths of satan as they say i will
not put upon you any other burthen
yet that which you have hold fast till i come
and he that shall overcome and keep my words unto the end i will
give him power over the nations
nations and provinces as patrons and shall come with him at the end of
the world to execute his will against those who have not kept his
commandments
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and as the vessel of a
potter they shall be broken
as i also have received of my father and i will give him the
morning star
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the
churches
and to the angel of the church of sardis write these things saith
he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy
works and that thou hast the name of being alive and thou art dead
be watchful and strengthen the things that remain which are ready
to die for i find not thy works full before my god
have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and heard
and observe and do penance if then thou shalt not watch i will come to
thee as a thief and thou shalt not know at what hour i will come to
thee
but thou hast a few names in sardis which have not defiled their
garments and they shall walk with me in white because they are worthy
he that shall overcome shall thus be clothed in white garments and
his name before my father and before his angels
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the
churches
and to the angel of the church of philadelphia write these things
saith the holy one and the true one he that hath the key of david he
that openeth and no man shutteth shutteth and no man openeth
i know thy works behold i have given before thee a door opened
which no man can shut because thou hast a little strength and hast kept
my word and hast not denied my name
behold i will bring of the synagogue of satan who say they are
before thy feet and they shall know that i have loved thee
because thou hast kept the word of my patience i will also keep
thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon the whole world
to try them that dwell upon the earth
behold i come quickly hold fast that which thou hast that no
man take thy crown
he that shall overcome i will make him a pillar in the temple of
my god and he shall go out no more and i will write upon him the name
of my god and the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem which
cometh down out of heaven from my god and my new name
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the
churches
and to the angel of the church of laodicea write these things
saith the amen the faithful and true witness who is the beginning of
the creation of god
of god the beginning px that is the principle the source
and the efficient cause of the whole creation
i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou
wert cold or hot
but because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will
begin to vomit thee out of my mouth
because thou sayest i am rich and made wealthy and have need of
nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor
and blind and naked
i counsel thee to buy of me gold fire tried that thou mayest be
made rich and mayest be clothed in white garments and that the shame of
thy nakedness may not appear and anoint thy eyes with eyesalve that
thou mayest see
such as i love i rebuke and chastise be zealous therefore and do
penance
behold i stand at the gate and knock if any man shall hear my
voice and open to me the door i will come in to him and will sup with
him and he with me
to him that shall overcome i will give to sit with me in my
throne as i also have overcome and am set down with my father in his
throne
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the
churches
living creatures
after these things i looked and behold a door was opened in
heaven and the first voice which i heard as it were of a trumpet
speaking with me said come up hither and i will shew thee the things
which must be done hereafter
and immediately i was in the spirit and behold there was a throne
set in heaven and upon the throne one sitting
and he that sat was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine
stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like
unto an emerald
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the
seats four and twenty ancients sitting clothed in white garments and
on their heads were crowns of gold
and from the throne proceeded lightnings and voices and thunders
seven spirits of god
and in the sight of the throne was as it were a sea of glass like
to crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne
were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind
and the first living creature was like a lion and the second
living creature like a calf and the third living creature having the
face as it were of a man and the fourth living creature was like an
eagle flying
and the four living creatures had each of them six wings and round
about and within they are full of eyes and they rested not day and
night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty who was and who is
and who is to come
and when those living creatures gave glory and honour and
benediction to him that sitteth on the throne who liveth for ever and
ever
the four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on
the throne and adored him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their
crowns before the throne saying
thou art worthy o lord our god to receive glory and honour and
power because thou hast created all things and for thy will they were
and have been created
receives adoration and praise from all
and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
written within and without sealed with seven seals
and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is
worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof
and no man was able neither in heaven nor on earth nor under the
earth to open the book nor to look on it
and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book
nor to see it
and one of the ancients said to me weep not behold the lion of
the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book
and to loose the seven seals thereof
and i saw and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four
living creatures and in the midst of the ancients a lamb standing as
it were slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven
and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat
on the throne
and when he had opened the book the four living creatures and the
four and twenty ancients fell down before the lamb having every one of
them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of
saints
to christ the prayers of the faithful upon earth
and they sung a new canticle saying thou art worthy o lord to
take the book and to open the seals thereof because thou wast slain and
hast redeemed us to god in thy blood out of every tribe and tongue and
people and nation
and hast made us to our god a kingdom and priests and we shall
reign on the earth
and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the
throne and the living creatures and the ancients and the number of them
was thousands of thousands
saying with a loud voice the lamb that was slain is worthy to
receive power and divinity and wisdom and strength and honour and glory
and benediction
and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under
the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them i heard
all saying to him that sitteth on the throne and to the lamb
benediction and honour and glory and power for ever and ever
and the four living creatures said amen and the four and twenty
ancients fell down on their faces and adored him that liveth for ever
and ever
and i saw that the lamb had opened one of the seven seals and i
heard one of the four living creatures as it were the voice of thunder
saying come and see
and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a
bow and there was a crown given him and he went forth conquering that
he might conquer
to subdue the world by his gospel the other horses that follow
represent the judgments and punishment that were to fall on the enemies
of christ and his church the red horse signifies war the black horse
famine and the pale horse which has death for its rider plagues or
pestilence
and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second living
creature saying come and see
and there went out another horse that was red and to him that sat
thereon it was given that he should take peace from the earth and that
they should kill one another and a great sword was given to him
and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third living
creature saying come and see and behold a black horse and he that
sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand
and i heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living
creatures saying two pounds of wheat for a penny and thrice two
pounds of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the wine and the
oil
and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the
fourth living creature saying come and see
and behold a pale horse and he that sat upon him his name was
parts of the earth to kill with sword with famine and with death and
with the beasts of the earth
and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the
souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony
which they held
of the martyrs live in heaven as their bodies are here deposited under
our altars
and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy
and true dost thou not judge and revenge our blood on them that dwell
on the earth
but out of zeal for the glory of god and a desire that the lord would
accelerate the general judgment and the complete beatitude of all his
elect
and white robes were given to every one of them one and it was
said to them that they should rest for a little time till their fellow
servants and their brethren who are to be slain even as they should be
filled up
and i saw when he had opened the sixth seal and behold there was
a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and
the whole moon became as blood
and the stars from heaven fell upon the earth as the fig tree
casteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great wind
and the heaven departed as a book folded up and every mountain
and the islands were moved out of their places
and the kings of the earth and the princes and tribunes and the
rich and the strong and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves
in the dens and in the rocks of mountains
and they say to the mountains and the rocks fall upon us and hide
us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne and from the wrath
of the lamb
for the great day of their wrath is come and who shall be able to
stand
clothed in white robes
after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners
of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that they should not
blow upon the earth nor upon the sea nor on any tree
and i saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun
having the sign of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the
four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea
saying hurt not the earth nor the sea nor the trees till we sign
the servants of our god in their foreheads
and i heard the number of them that were signed an hundred forty
four thousand were signed of every tribe of the children of israel
of the tribe of juda twelve thousand signed of the tribe of
signed
of the tribe of aser twelve thousand signed of the tribe of
thousand signed
of the tribe of simeon twelve thousand signed of the tribe of
signed
of the tribe of zabulon twelve thousand signed of the tribe of
thousand signed
after this i saw a great multitude which no man could number of
all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues standing before the
throne and in sight of the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in
their hands
and they cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god
who sitteth upon the throne and to the lamb
and all the angels stood round about the throne and the ancients
and the four living creatures and they fell down before the throne upon
their faces and adored god
saying amen benediction and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving
honour and power and strength to our god for ever and ever amen
and one of the ancients answered and said to me these that are
clothed in white robes who are they and whence came they
and i said to him my lord thou knowest and he said to me these
are they who are come out of great tribulation and have washed their
robes and have made them white in the blood of the lamb
therefore they are before the throne of god and they serve him
day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall
dwell over them
they shall no more hunger nor thirst neither shall the sun fall
on them nor any heat
for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall rule them
and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of life and god
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in
heaven as it were for half an hour
and i saw seven angels standing in the presence of god and there
were given to them seven trumpets
and another angel came and stood before the altar having a golden
censer and there was given to him much incense that he should offer of
the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which is before the
throne of god
and the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended
up before god from the hand of the angel
and the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the
altar and cast it on the earth and there were thunders and voices and
lightnings and a great earthquake
and the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves
to sound the trumpet
and the first angel sounded the trumpet and there followed hail
and fire mingled with blood and it was cast on the earth and the
third part of the earth was burnt up and the third part of the trees
was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up
and the second angel sounded the trumpet and as it were a great
mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part
of the sea became blood
and the third part of those creatures died which had life in the
sea and the third part of the ships was destroyed
and the third angel sounded the trumpet and a great star fell
from heaven burning as it were a torch and it fell on the third part
of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters
and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of
the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because
they were made bitter
and the fourth angel sounded the trumpet and the third part of
the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part
of the stars so that the third part of them was darkened and the day
did not shine for a third part of it and the night in like manner
and i beheld and heard the voice of one eagle flying through the
midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the
inhabitants of the earth by reason of the rest of the voices of the
three angels who are yet to sound the trumpet
horsemen
and the fifth angel sounded the trumpet and i saw a star fall from
heaven upon the earth and there was given to him the key of the
bottomless pit
men from the true faith or a whole nation falling into error and
separating from the church not having the sign of god in their
foreheads and there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit
the power which is here signified by a key of opening hell
and he opened the bottomless pit and the smoke of the pit arose
as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened
with the smoke of the pit
and from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the
earth and power was given to them as the scorpions of the earth have
power
having the appearance of locusts but large and monstrous as here
described or they may be real locusts but of an extraordinary size and
monstrous shape such as were never before seen on earth sent to
torment those who have not the sign or seal of god on their foreheads
those heretics that sprung from jews and with them denied the divinity
of jesus christ as theodotus praxeas noetus paul of samosata
religion they tormented and infected the souls of men stinging them
like scorpions with the poison of their heresies others have explained
these locusts and other animals mentioned in different places
throughout this sacred and mystical book in a most absurd fanciful
and ridiculous manner they make abaddon the pope and the locusts to be
friars mendicant etc here it is thought proper not to enter into any
controversy upon that subject as the inventors of these fancies have
been already answered and fully refuted by many controvertists
besides those who might be inposed on by such chimerical writers are
in these days much better informed
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of
the earth nor any green thing nor any tree but only the men who have
not the sign of god on their foreheads
and it was given unto them that they should not kill them but that
they should torment them five months and their torment was as the
torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man
and in those days men shall seek death and shall not find it and
they shall desire to die and death shall fly from them
and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their
faces were as the faces of men
and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as
lions
and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron and the noise of
their wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to
battle
and they had tails like to scorpions and there were stings in
their tails and their power was to hurt men five months and they had
over them
a king the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in hebrew is
one woe is past and behold there come yet two woes more
hereafter
and the sixth angel sounded the trumpet and i heard a voice from
the four horns of the golden altar which is before the eyes of god
saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet loose the four
angels who are bound in the great river euphrates
and the four angels were loosed who were prepared for an hour
and a day and a month and a year for to kill the third part of men
and the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times
ten thousand and i heard the number of them
and thus i saw the horses in the vision and they that sat on them
had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone and the heads
of the horses were as the heads of lions and from their mouths
proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone
and by these three plagues was slain the third part of men by the
fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their
mouths
for the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails
hurt
and the rest of the men who were not slain by these plagues did
not do penance from the works of their hands that they should not adore
devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which
neither can see nor hear nor walk
neither did they penance from their murders nor from their
sorceries nor from their fornication nor from their thefts
and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with
a cloud and a rainbow was on his head and his face as the sun and
his feet as pillars of fire
and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right
foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth
and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he
had cried seven thunders uttered their voices
and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about
to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying to me seal up the
things which the seven thunders have spoken and write them not
and the angel whom i saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth
lifted up his hand to heaven
and he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever who created
heaven and the things which are therein and the earth and the things
which are in it and the sea and the things which are therein that time
shall be no longer
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall
begin to sound the trumpet the mystery of god shall be finished as he
hath declared by his servants the prophets
agreeable to the gospel of the final victory of christ and of that
eternal life which should be the reward of the temporal sufferings of
the martyrs and faithful servants of god
and i heard a voice from heaven again speaking to me and saying
standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
and i went to the angel saying unto him that he should give me
the book and he said to me take the book and eat it up and it shall
make thy belly bitter but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey
and i took the book from the hand of the angel and ate it up and
it was in my mouth sweet as honey and when i had eaten it my belly
was bitter
and he said to me thou must prophesy again to many nations and
peoples and tongues and kings
and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and it was said to
me arise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that
adore therein
but the court which is without the temple cast out and measure it
not because it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city they shall
tread under foot two and forty months
and i will give unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a
thousand two hundred sixty days clothed in sackcloth
these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand
before the lord of the earth
and if any man will hurt them fire shall come out of their mouths
and shall devour their enemies and if any man will hurt them in this
manner must he be slain
these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of
their prophecy and they have power over waters to turn them into blood
and to strike the earth with all plagues as often as they will
and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that
ascendeth out of the abyss shall make war against them and shall
overcome them and kill them
and their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which
is called spiritually sodom and egypt where their lord also was
crucified
and they of the tribes and peoples and tongues and nations shall
see their bodies for three days and a half and they shall not suffer
their bodies to be laid in sepulchres
and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and
make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two
prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth
and after three days and a half the spirit of life from god
entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell
upon them that saw them
and they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them come up
hither and they went up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies saw
them
and at that hour there was made a great earthquake and the tenth
part of the city fell and there were slain in the earthquake names of
men seven thousand and the rest were cast into a fear and gave glory
to the god of heaven
the second woe is past and behold the third woe will come
quickly
and the seventh angel sounded the trumpet and there were great
voices in heaven saying the kingdom of this world is become our lords
and his christs and he shall reign for ever and ever amen
and the four and twenty ancients who sit on their seats in the
sight of god fell on their faces and adored god saying
we give thee thanks o lord god almighty who art and who wast
and who art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power
and thou hast reigned
and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time
of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest render
reward to thy servants the prophets and the saints and to them that
fear thy name little and great and shouldest destroy them who have
corrupted the earth
and the temple of god was opened in heaven and the ark of his
testament was seen in his temple and there were lightnings and voices
and an earthquake and great hail
persecutor
and a great sign appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun
and the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars
our blessed lady the church is clothed with the sun that is with
under her feet and the twelve stars with which she is crowned are the
twelve apostles she is in labour and pain whilst she brings forth her
children and christ in them in the midst of afflictions and
persecutions
and being with child she cried travailing in birth and was in
pain to be delivered
and there was seen another sign in heaven and behold a great red
dragon having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven diadems
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast
them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman who was ready
to be delivered that when she should be delivered he might devour her
son
and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations
with an iron rod and her son was taken up to god and to his throne
and the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place
prepared by god that there they should feed her a thousand two hundred
sixty days
and there was a great battle in heaven michael and his angels
fought with the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels
and they prevailed not neither was their place found any more in
heaven
and that great dragon was cast out that old serpent who is
called the devil and satan who seduceth the whole world and he was
cast unto the earth and his angels were thrown down with him
and i heard a loud voice in heaven saying now is come salvation
and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ
because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth who accused them
before our god day and night
and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of
the testimony and they loved not their lives unto death
therefore rejoice o heavens and you that dwell therein woe
to the earth and to the sea because the devil is come down unto you
having great wrath knowing that he hath but a short time
and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he
persecuted the woman who brought forth the man child
and there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle
that she might fly into the desert unto her place where she is
nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the
serpent
and the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as
it were a river that he might cause her to be carried away by the
river
and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth
and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth
and the dragon was angry against the woman and went to make war
with the rest of her seed who keep the commandments of god and have the
testimony of jesus christ
and he stood upon the sand of the sea
and i saw a beast coming up out the sea having seven heads and
ten horns and upon his horns ten diadems and upon his heads names of
blasphemy
the whole company of infidels enemies and persecutors of the people of
seven kings that is seven principal kingdoms or empires which have
exercised or shall exercise tyrannical power over the people of god
of these five were then fallen viz the egyptian assyrian chaldean
persecutors
and the beast which i saw was like to a leopard and his feet were
as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the
dragon gave him his own strength and great power
and i saw one of his heads as it were slain to death and his
deaths wound was healed and all the earth was in admiration after the
beast
the idolatry of the roman empire signified by the sixth head received
from constantine which was as it were healed again by julian the
and they adored the dragon which gave power to the beast and
they adored the beast saying who is like to the beast and who shall
be able to fight with him
and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and
blasphemies and power was given to him to do two and forty months
and he opened his mouth unto blasphemies against god to blaspheme
his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to
overcome them and power was given him over every tribe and people and
tongue and nation
and all that dwell upon the earth adored him whose names are not
written in the book of life of the lamb which was slain from the
beginning of the world
inasmuch as all mercy and grace from the beginning was given in view
of his death and passion
if any man have an ear let him hear
he that shall lead into captivity shall go into captivity he
that shall kill by the sword must be killed by the sword here is the
patience and the faith of the saints
and i saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had
two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon
the heathenish priests and magicians the principal promoters both of
idolatry and persecution
and he executed all the power of the former beast in his sight
beast whose wound to death was healed
and he did great signs so that he made also fire to come down
from heaven unto the earth in the sight of men
and he seduced them that dwell on the earth for the signs which
were given him to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that
dwell on the earth that they should make the image of the beast which
had the wound by the sword and lived
and it was given him to give life to the image of the beast and
that the image of the beast should speak and should cause that
whosoever will not adore the image of the beast should be slain
and he shall make all both little and great rich and poor
freemen and bondmen to have a character in their right hand or on their
foreheads
and that no man might buy or sell but he that hath the
character or the name of the beast or the number of his name
here is wisdom he that hath understanding let him count the
number of the beast for it is the number of a man and the number of
him is six hundred sixtysix
this number
shall fall upon the wicked
and i beheld and lo a lamb stood upon mount sion and with him an
hundred fortyfour thousand having his name and the name of his father
written on their foreheads
and i heard a voice from heaven as the noise of many waters and
as the voice of great thunder and the voice which i heard was as the
voice of harpers harping on their harps
and they sung as it were a new canticle before the throne and
before the four living creatures and the ancients and no man could say
the canticle but those hundred fortyfour thousand who were purchased
from the earth
these are they who were not defiled with women for they are
virgins these follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth these were
purchased from among men the firstfruits to god and to the lamb
and in their mouth there was found no lie for they are without
spot before the throne of god
and i saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven having
the eternal gospel to preach unto them that sit upon the earth and over
every nation and tribe and tongue and people
saying with a loud voice fear the lord and give him honour
because the hour of his judgment is come and adore ye him that made
heaven and earth the sea and the fountains of waters
and another angel followed saying that great babylon is fallen
is fallen which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of
her fornication
world in general which god will punish and destroy after the short
time of this mortal life or it may signify every great city wherein
enormous sins and abominations are daily committed and that when the
measure of its iniquities is full the punishments due to its crimes are
poured on it it may also be some city of the description in the text
that will exist and be destroyed as here described towards the end of
the world
and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if
any man shall adore the beast and his image and receive his character in
his forehead or in his hand
he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is
mingled with pure wine in the cup of his wrath and shall be tormented
with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight
of the lamb
and the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever and
ever neither have they rest day nor night who have adored the beast
and his image and whoever receiveth the character of his name
here is the patience of the saints who keep the commandments of
and i heard a voice from heaven saying to me write blessed are
the dead who die in the lord from henceforth now saith the spirit
that they may rest from their labours for their works follow them
and i saw and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one
sitting like to the son of man having on his head a crown of gold and
in his hand a sharp sickle
and another angel came out from the temple crying with a loud
voice to him that sat upon the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap
because the hour is come to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe
and he that sat on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth
and the earth was reaped
and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he
also having a sharp sickle
and another angel came out from the altar who had power over
fire and he cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle
saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the
vineyard of the earth because the grapes thereof are ripe
and the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth and
gathered the vineyard of the earth and cast it into the great press of
the wrath of god
and the press was trodden without the city and blood came out of
the press up to the horses bridles for a thousand and six hundred
furlongs
the seven vials
and i saw another sign in heaven great and wonderful seven
angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath
of god
and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them
that had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name
standing on the sea of glass having the harps of god
and singing the canticle of moses the servant of god and the
canticle of the lamb saying great and wonderful are thy works o lord
who shall not fear thee o lord and magnify thy name for thou
only art holy for all nations shall come and shall adore in thy sight
because thy judgments are manifest
and after these things i looked and behold the temple of the
tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened
and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven
plagues clothed with clean and white linen and girt about the breasts
with golden girdles
and one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels
seven golden vials full of the wrath of god who liveth for ever and
ever
and the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of god and
from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the
seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled
and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
angels go and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of god upon the
earth
and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and
there fell a sore and grievous wound upon men who had the character of
the beast and upon them that adored the image thereof
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and there
came blood as it were of a dead man and every living soul died in the
sea
and the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the
fountains of waters and there was made blood
and i heard the angel of the waters saying thou art just o lord
who art and who wast the holy one because thou hast judged these
things
for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast
given them blood to drink for they are worthy
and i heard another from the altar saying yea o lord god
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and it was
given unto him to afflict men with heat and fire
and men were scorched with great heat and they blasphemed the
name of god who hath power over these plagues neither did they penance
to give him glory
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
beast and his kingdom became dark and they gnawed their tongues for
pain
and they blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and
wounds and did not penance for their works
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon that great river
for the kings from the rising of the sun
and i saw from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the
beast and from the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits
like frogs
for they are the spirits of devils working signs and they go
forth unto the kings of the whole earth to gather them to battle
against the great day of the almighty god
behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and
keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame
and he shall gather them together into a place which in hebrew is
called armagedon
and the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air and
there came a great voice out of the temple from the throne saying it
is done
and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and there was
a great earthquake such an one as never had been since men were upon
the earth such an earthquake so great
and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities
of the gentiles fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god
to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath
and every island fled away and the mountains were not found
and great hail like a talent came down from heaven upon men
and men blasphemed god for the plague of the hail because it was
exceeding great
sits
and there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials and
spoke with me saying come i will shew thee the condemnation of the
great harlot who sitteth upon many waters
with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and
they who inhabit the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
whoredom
and he took me away in spirit into the desert and i saw a woman
sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy
having seven heads and ten horns
and the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet and
gilt with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in
her hand full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication
and on her forehead a name was written a mystery babylon the
great the mother of the fornications and the abominations of the earth
title of the great harlot is to be taken in a mystical sense babylon
understood of any particular city pagan rome which then and for three
hundred years persecuted the church and was the principal seat both of
empire and idolatry
and i saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with
the blood of the martyrs of jesus and i wondered when i had seen her
with great admiration
and the angel said to me why dost thou wonder i will tell thee
the mystery of the woman and of the beast which carrieth her which hath
the seven heads and ten horns
the beast which thou sawest was and is not and shall come up
out of the bottomless pit and go into destruction and the inhabitants
on the earth whose names are not written in the book of life from the
foundation of the world shall wonder seeing the beast that was and is
not
signify the power of the devil which was and is not being much limited
by the coming of christ but shall again exert itself under antichrist
instruments of his tyranny of which five were then fallen see chap
and below ver the beast itself is said to be the eighth
and is of the seven because they all act under the devil and by his
instigation so that his power is in them all yet so as to make up as
it were an eighth empire distinct from them all
and here is the understanding that hath wisdom the seven heads
are seven mountains upon which the woman sitteth and they are seven
kings
five are fallen one is and the other is not yet come and when
he is come he must remain a short time
and the beast which was and is not the same also is the eighth
and is of the seven and goeth into destruction
and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings who have not
yet received a kingdom but shall receive power as kings one hour after
the beast
which nevertheless shall be made instruments of the justice of god for
the punishment of babylon some understand this of the goths vandals
these have one design and their strength and power they shall
deliver to the beast
these shall fight with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them
because he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with
him are called and elect and faithful
and he said to me the waters which thou sawest where the harlot
sitteth are peoples and nations and tongues
and the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast these shall
hate the harlot and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her
flesh and shall burn her with fire
for god hath given into their hearts to do that which pleaseth
him that they give their kingdom to the beast till the words of god be
fulfilled
and the woman which thou sawest is the great city which hath
kingdom over the kings of the earth
and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven
having great power and the earth was enlightened with his glory
and he cried out with a strong voice saying babylon the great is
fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold
of every unclean spirit and the hold of every unclean and hateful bird
because all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with
her and the merchants of the earth have been made rich by the power of
her delicacies
and i heard another voice from heaven saying go out from her my
people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not
of her plagues
for her sins have reached unto heaven and the lord hath
remembered her iniquities
render to her as she also hath rendered to you and double unto
her double according to her works in the cup wherein she hath mingled
mingle ye double unto her
as much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies so
much torment and sorrow give ye to her because she saith in her heart
therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning
and famine and she shall be burnt with the fire because god is strong
who shall judge her
and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and
lived in delicacies with her shall weep and bewail themselves over her
when they shall see the smoke of her burning
standing afar off for fear of her torments saying alas alas
that great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy
judgment come
and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for
no man shall buy their merchandise any more
merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls
and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and
all manner of vessels of ivory and all manner of vessels of precious
stone and of brass and of iron and of marble
and cinnamon and odours and ointment and frankincense and wine
and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and
chariots and slaves and souls of men
and the fruits of the desire of thy soul are departed from thee
and all fat and goodly things are perished from thee and they shall
find them no more at all
the merchants of these things who were made rich shall stand
afar off from her for fear of her torments weeping and mourning
and saying alas alas that great city which was clothed with
fine linen and purple and scarlet and was gilt with gold and precious
stones and pearls
for in one hour are so great riches come to nought and every
shipmaster and all that sail into the lake and mariners and as many as
work in the sea stood afar off
and cried seeing the place of her burning saying what city is
like to this great city
and they cast dust upon their heads and cried weeping and
mourning saying alas alas that great city wherein all were made
rich that had ships at sea by reason of her prices for in one hour
she is made desolate
rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets
and a mighty angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone
and cast it into the sea saying with such violence as this shall
all
and the voice of harpers and of musicians and of them that play
on the pipe and on the trumpet shall no more be heard at all in thee
and no craftsman of any art whatsoever shall be found any more at all in
thee and the sound of the mill shall be heard no more at all in thee
and the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in thee and
the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more at all
in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for all
nations have been deceived by thy enchantments
and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of
all that were slain upon the earth
victory over the beast and the kings of the earth
after these things i heard as it were the voice of much people in
heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and power is to our god
for true and just are his judgments who hath judged the great
harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication and hath revenged
the blood of his servants at her hands
and again they said alleluia and her smoke ascendeth for ever
and ever
and the four and twenty ancients and the four living creatures
fell down and adored god that sitteth upon the throne saying amen
and a voice came out from the throne saying give praise to our
and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the
voice of many waters and as the voice of great thunders saying
let us be glad and rejoice and give glory to him for the marriage
of the lamb is come and his wife hath prepared herself
and it is granted to her that she should clothe herself with fine
linen glittering and white for the fine linen are the justifications
of saints
and he said to me write blessed are they that are called to the
marriage supper of the lamb and he saith to me these words of god are
true
and i fell down before his feet to adore him and he saith to
me see thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren who
have the testimony of jesus adore god for the testimony of jesus is
the spirit of prophecy
is of opinion that this angel appeared in so glorious a manner that
honour had not the angel stopped him by telling him he was but his
fellow servant st gregory hom in evang rather thinks that the
veneration offered by st john was not divine honour or indeed any
other than what might lawfully be given but was nevertheless refused by
the angel in consideration of the dignity to which our human nature had
been raised by the incarnation of the son of god and the dignity of
and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that
sat upon him was called faithful and true and with justice doth he
judge and fight
and his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many
diadems and he had a name written which no man knoweth but himself
and he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood and his
name is called the word of god
and the armies that are in heaven followed him on white horses
clothed in fine linen white and clean
and out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp twoedged sword that
with it he may strike the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of
iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of
and he hath on his garment and on his thigh written king of
and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud
voice saying to all the birds that did fly through the midst of heaven
that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of tribunes and
the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on
them and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen and of little and of
great
and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies
gathered together to make war with him that sat upon the horse and with
his army
and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet who
wrought signs before him wherewith he seduced them who received the
character of the beast and who adored his image these two were cast
alive into the pool of fire burning with brimstone
and the rest were slain by the sword of him that sitteth upon the
horse which proceedeth out of his mouth and all the birds were filled
with their flesh
church the last judgment
and i saw an angel coming down from heaven having the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand
and he laid hold on the dragon the old serpent which is the
devil and satan and bound him for a thousand years
passion of christ for a thousand years that is for the whole time of
the new testament but especially from the time of the destruction of
church towards the end of the world during which time the souls of the
martyrs and saints live and reign with christ in heaven in the first
resurrection which is that of the soul to the life of glory as the
second resurrection will be that of the body at the day of the general
judgment
and he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a
seal upon him that he should no more seduce the nations till the
thousand years be finished and after that he must be loosed a little
time
and i saw seats and they sat upon them and judgment was given
unto them and the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of
image nor received his character on their foreheads or in their hands
the rest of the dead lived not till the thousand years were
finished this is the first resurrection
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection
and when the thousand years shall be finished satan shall be
loosed out of his prison and shall go forth and seduce the nations which
are over the four quarters of the earth gog and magog and shall gather
them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea
and they came upon the breadth of the earth and encompassed the
camp of the saints and the beloved city
and there came down fire from god out of heaven and devoured them
and the devil who seduced them was cast into the pool of fire and
brimstone where both the beast
and the false prophet shall be tormented day and night for ever
and ever
and i saw a great white throne and one sitting upon it from
whose face the earth and heaven fled away and there was no place found
for them
and i saw the dead great and small standing in the presence of
the throne and the books were opened and another book was opened
which was the book of life and the dead were judged by those things
which were written in the books according to their works
and the sea gave up the dead that were in it and death and hell
gave up their dead that were in them and they were judged every one
according to their works
and hell and death were cast into the pool of fire this is the
second death
and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
into the pool of fire
i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the
first earth was gone and the sea is now no more
their substance but in their qualities
and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down out
of heaven from god prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
and i heard a great voice from the throne saying behold the
tabernacle of god with men and he will dwell with them and they shall
be his people and god himself with them shall be their god
and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and death shall
be no more nor mourning nor crying nor sorrow shall be any more for
the former things are passed away
and he that sat on the throne said behold i make all things
new and he said to me write for these words are most faithful and
true
and he said to me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning
and the end to him that thirsteth i will give of the fountain of the
water of life freely
he that shall overcome shall possess these things and i will be
his god and he shall be my son
but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers
and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars they shall
have their portion in the pool burning with fire and brimstone which is
the second death
and there came one of the seven angels who had the vials full of
the seven last plagues and spoke with me saying come and i will shew
thee the bride the wife of the lamb
and he took me up in spirit to a great and high mountain and he
shewed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god
having the glory of god and the light thereof was like to a
precious stone as to the jasper stone even as crystal
and it had a wall great and high having twelve gates and in the
gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of
the twelve tribes of the children of israel
on the east three gates and on the north three gates and on
the south three gates and on the west three gates
and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the
twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
and he that spoke with me had a measure of a reed of gold to
measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall
and the city lieth in a foursquare and the length thereof is as
great as the breadth and he measured the city with the golden reed for
twelve thousand furlongs and the length and the height and the breadth
thereof are equal
and he measured the wall thereof an hundred fortyfour cubits
the measure of a man which is of an angel
the angel this seems to be the true meaning of these words
and the building of the wall thereof was of jasper stone but the
city itself pure gold like to clear glass
and the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all
manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second
sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald
the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolite
the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the
eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst
and the twelve gates are twelve pearls one to each and every
several gate was of one several pearl and the street of the city was
pure gold as it were transparent glass
and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty is the
temple thereof and the lamb
and the city hath no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine
in it for the glory of god hath enlightened it and the lamb is the
lamp thereof
and the nations shall walk in the light of it and the kings of
the earth shall bring their glory and honour into it
and the gates thereof shall not be shut by day for there shall
be no night there
and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it
there shall not enter into it any thing defiled or that worketh
abomination or maketh a lie but they that are written in the book of
life of the lamb
and he shewed me a river of water of life clear as crystal
proceeding from the throne of god and of the lamb
in the midst of the street thereof and on both sides of the
river was the tree of life bearing twelve fruits yielding its fruits
every month the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations
and there shall be no curse any more but the throne of god and of
the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him
and they shall see his face and his name shall be on their
foreheads
and night shall be no more and they shall not need the light of
the lamp nor the light of the sun because the lord god shall enlighten
then and they shall reign for ever and ever
and he said to me these words are most faithful and true and
the lord god of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to shew his
servant the things which must be done shortly
and behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the words
of the prophecy of this book
and i john who have heard and seen these things and after i
had heard and seen i fell down to adore before the feet of the angel
who shewed me the things
and he said to me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow
servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them that keep the
words of the prophecy of this book adore god
and he saith to me seal not the words of the prophecy of this
book for the time is at hand
and temporal things vanish and are but of short duration as to the
time when the chief predictions should come to pass we have no
certainty as appears by the different opinions both of the ancient
fathers and late interpreters many think that most things set down
from the th chapter to the end will not be fulfilled till a little
time before the end of the world others are of opinion that a great
part of them and particularly the fall of the wicked babylon happened
at the destruction of paganism by the destruction of heathen rome and
its persecuting heathen emperors of these interpretations see aleazar
in his long commentary see the learned bossnet bishop of meaux in his
treatise on this book and p alleman in his notes on the same
measure may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned
men in fine others think that st johns design was in a mystical way
by metaphors and allegories to represent the attempts and persecutions
of the wicked against the servants of god the punishments that should
in a short time fall upon babylon that is upon all the wicked in
general the eternal happiness and reward which god had reserved for
the pious inhabitants of jerusalem that is for his faithful servants
after their short trials and the tribulations of this mortal life in
the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions
which we may easily enough understand but we have no certainty when we
apply these predictions to particular events for as st jerome takes
notice the apocalypse has as many mysteries as words or rather
mysteries in every word apocalypsis joannis tot habet sacramenta quot
verbaparum dixi in verbis singulis multiplices latent

he that hurteth let him hurt still and he that is filthy let
him be filthy still and he that is just let him be justified still
and he that is holy let him be sanctified still
sin but an intimation that how far soever the wicked may proceed
their progress shall quickly end and then they must expect to meet with
proportionable punishments
behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to render to
every man according to his works
i am alpha and omega the first and the last the beginning and
the end
blessed are they that wash their robes in the blood of the lamb
that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in by the
gates into the city
without are dogs and sorcerers and unchaste and murderers and
servers of idols and every one that loveth and maketh a lie
i jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in
the churches i am the root and stock of david the bright and morning
star
and the spirit and the bride say come and he that heareth let
him say come and he that thirsteth let him come and he that will
let him take the water of life freely
for i testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy
of this book if any man shall add to these things god shall add unto
him the plagues written in this book
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this
prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out
of the holy city and from these things that are written in this book
he that giveth testimony of these things saith surely i come
quickly amen come lord jesus
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
