new teachers the apostles calling
paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ
and god the father who raised him from the dead
and all the brethren who are with me to the churches of galatia
grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord
who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this
present wicked world according to the will of god and our father
to whom is glory for ever and ever amen
i wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into
the grace of christ unto another gospel
which is not another only there are some that trouble you and
would pervert the gospel of christ
but though we or an angel from heaven preach a gospel to you
besides that which we have preached to you let him be anathema
as we said before so now i say again if any one preach to you a
gospel besides that which you have received let him be anathema
for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men if
for i give you to understand brethren that the gospel which was
preached by me is not according to man
for neither did i receive it of man nor did i learn it but by the
revelation of jesus christ
for you have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews
religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and
wasted it
and i made progress in the jews religion above many of my equals
in my own nation being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my
fathers
but when it pleased him who separated me from my mothers womb and
called me by his grace
to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the
neither went i to jerusalem to the apostles who were before me
but i went into arabia and again i returned to damascus
then after three years i went to jerusalem to see peter and i
tarried with him fifteen days
but other of the apostles i saw none saving james the brother of
the lord
now the things which i write to you behold before god i lie
not
afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia
and i was unknown by face to the churches of judea which were in
but they had heard only he who persecuted us in times past doth
now preach the faith which once he impugned
and they glorified god in me
then after fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with
and i went up according to revelation and communicated to them the
gospel which i preach among the gentiles but apart to them who seemed
to be some thing lest perhaps i should run or had run in vain
but neither titus who was with me being a gentile was compelled
to be circumcised
but because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in
privately to spy our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they
might bring us into servitude
to whom we yielded not by subjection no not for an hour that the
truth of the gospel might continue with you
but of them who seemed to be some thing what they were some time
it is nothing to me god accepteth not the person of man for to me
they that seemed to be some thing added nothing
but contrariwise when they had seen that to me was committed the
gospel of the uncircumcision as to peter was that of the circumcision
uncircumcised that is to the gentiles st paul was called in an
extraordinary manner to be the apostle of the gentiles st peter
besides his general commission over the whole flock john
etc had a peculiar charge of the people of the circumscision that
is of the jews
for he who wrought in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision
wrought in me also among the gentiles
and when they had known the grace that was given to me james and
right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the gentiles and they
unto the circumcision
only that we should be mindful of the poor which same thing also
but when cephas was come to antioch i withstood him to the face
because he was to be blamed
table of the gentiles for fear of giving offence to the jewish
converts but this in such circumstances when his so doing might be of
ill consequence to the gentiles who might be induced thereby to think
themselves obliged to conform to the jewish way of living to the
prejudice of their christian liberty neither was st pauls
reprehending him any argument against his supremacy for in such cases
an inferior may and sometimes ought with respect to admonish his
superior
for before that some came from james he did eat with the
fearing them who were of the circumcision
and to his dissimulation the rest of the jews consented so that
but when i saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of
the gospel i said to cephas before them all if thou being a jew
livest after the manner of the gentiles and not as the jews do how dost
thou compel the gentiles to live as do the jews
we by nature are jews and not of the gentiles sinners
but knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law but
by the faith of jesus christ we also believe in christ jesus that we
may be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law
because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified
but if while we seek to be justified in christ we ourselves also
are found sinners is christ then the minister of sin god forbid
for if i build up again the things which i have destroyed i make
myself a prevaricator
for i through the law am dead to the law that i may live to
and i live now not i but christ liveth in me and that i live
now in the flesh i live in the faith of the son of god who loved me
and delivered himself for me
i cast not away the grace of god for if justice be by the law
then christ died in vain
but by faith
o senseless galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not
obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been set forth
crucified among you
this only would i learn of you did you receive the spirit by the
works of the law or by the hearing of faith
are you so foolish that whereas you began in the spirit you would
now be made perfect by the flesh
have you suffered so great things in vain if it be yet in vain
he therefore who giveth to you the spirit and worketh miracles
among you doth he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of
the faith
as it is written abraham believed god and it was reputed to him
unto justice
know ye therefore that they who are of faith the same are the
children of abraham
and the scripture foreseeing that god justifieth the gentiles by
faith told unto abraham before in thee shall all nations be blessed
therefore they that are of faith shall be blessed with faithful
for as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse for
it is written cursed is every one that abideth not in all things which
are written in the book of the law to do them
but that in the law no man is justified with god it is manifest
because the just man liveth by faith
but the law is not of faith but he that doth those things shall
live in them
christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a
curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree
that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through
brethren i speak after the manner of man yet a mans testament
if it be confirmed no man despiseth nor addeth to it
to abraham were the promises made and to his seed he saith not
now this i say that the testament which was confirmed by god the
law which was made after four hundred and thirty years doth not
disannul to make the promise of no effect
for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise
why then was the law it was set because of transgressions until
the seed should come to whom he made the promise being ordained by
angels in the hand of a mediator
threats ordained by angels the law was delivered by angels speaking
in the name and person of god to moses who was the mediator on this
occasion between god and the people
now a mediator is not of one but god is one
was the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if
there had been a law given which could give life verily justice should
have been by the law
but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise
by the faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe
sin from which they could not be delivered but by faith in jesus
but before the faith came we were kept under the law shut up
unto that faith which was to be revealed
wherefore the law was our pedagogue in christ that we might be
justified by faith
but after the faith is come we are no longer under a pedagogue
for you are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
for as many of you as have been baptized in christ have put on
there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free
there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus
and if you be christs then are you the seed of abraham heirs
according to the promise
sons of abraham
as long as the heir is a child he differeth nothing from a
servant though he be lord of all
but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the
father
so we also when we were children were serving under the elements
of the world
religion in which the carnal jews were trained up or under those
corporeal creatures used in their manifold rites sacrifices and
sacraments
but when the fulness of the time was come god sent his son made
of a woman made under the law
that he might redeem them who were under the law that we might
receive the adoption of sons
and because you are sons god hath sent the spirit of his son into
your hearts crying abba father
therefore now he is not a servant but a son and if a son an
heir also through god
but then indeed not knowing god you served them who by nature
are not gods
but now after that you have known god or rather are known by god
how turn you again to the weak and needy elements which you desire to
serve again
you observe days and months and times and years
day or other christian festivals but either of the superstitious
observation of days lucky and unlucky or else of the jewish festivals
to the observance of which certain jewish teachers sought to induce the
i am afraid of you lest perhaps i have laboured in vain among
you
be ye as i because i also am as you brethren i beseech you you
have not injured me at all
and you know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the
gospel to you heretofore and your temptation in my flesh
you despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of
where is then your blessedness for i bear you witness that if it
could be done you would have plucked out your own eyes and would have
given them to me
am i then become your enemy because i tell you the truth
they are zealous in your regard not well but they would exclude
you that you might be zealous for them
but be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always and
not only when i am present with you
my little children of whom i am in labour again until christ be
formed in you
and i would willingly be present with you now and change my voice
because i am ashamed for you
tell me you that desire to be under the law have you not read
the law
for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a
bondwoman and the other by a free woman
but he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh
but he of the free woman was by promise
which things are said by an allegory for these are the two
testaments the one from mount sina engendering unto bondage which is
for sina is a mountain in arabia which hath affinity to that
but that jerusalem which is above is free which is our mother
for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break
forth and cry thou that travailest not for many are the children of the
desolate more than of her that hath a husband
now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise
but as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him
that was after the spirit so also it is now
but what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son
for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free
woman
so then brethren we are not the children of the bondwoman but of
the free by the freedom wherewith christ has made us free
the flesh and of the spirit
stand fast and be not held again under the yoke of bondage
behold i paul tell you that if you be circumcised christ shall
profit you nothing
and i testify again to every man circumcising himself that he is a
debtor to do the whole law
you are made void of christ you who are justified in the law you
are fallen from grace
for we in spirit by faith wait for the hope of justice
for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision but faith that worketh by charity
you did run well what hath hindered you that you should not obey
the truth
this persuasion is not from him that calleth you
a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump
i have confidence in you in the lord that you will not be of
another mind but he that troubleth you shall bear the judgment
whosoever he be
and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer
persecution then is the scandal of the cross made void
i would they were even cut off who trouble you
for you brethren have been called unto liberty only make not
liberty an occasion to the flesh but by charity of the spirit serve one
another
for all the law is fulfilled in one word thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself
but if you bite and devour one another take heed you be not
consumed one of another
i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the
lusts of the flesh
for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against
the flesh for these are contrary one to another so that you do not the
things that you would
but if you are led by the spirit you are not under the law
now the works of the flesh are manifest which are fornication
uncleanness immodesty luxury
idolatry witchcrafts enmities contentions emulations wraths
quarrels dissensions sects
envies murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the
which i foretell you as i have foretold to you that they who do such
things shall not obtain the kingdom of god
but the fruit of the spirit is charity joy peace patience
benignity goodness longanimity
mildness faith modesty continency chastity against such there
is no law
and they that are christs have crucified their flesh with the
vices and concupiscences
if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit
let us not be made desirous of vain glory provoking one another
envying one another
but in the cross of christ
brethren and if a man be overtaken in any fault you who are
spiritual instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness considering
thyself lest thou also be tempted
bear ye one anothers burdens and so you shall fulfil the law of
for if any man think himself to be some thing whereas he is
nothing he deceiveth himself
but let every one prove his own work and so he shall have glory in
himself only and not in another
for every one shall bear his own burden
and let him that is instructed in the word communicate to him that
instructeth him in all good things
be not deceived god is not mocked
for what things a man shall sow those also shall he reap for he
that soweth in his flesh of the flesh also shall reap corruption but he
that soweth in the spirit of the spirit shall reap life everlasting
and in doing good let us not fail for in due time we shall reap
not failing
therefore whilst we have time let us work good to all men but
especially to those who are of the household of the faith
see what a letter i have written to you with my own hand
for as many as desire to please in the flesh they constrain you
to be circumcised only that they may not suffer the persecution of the
cross of christ
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but
they will have you to be circumcised that they may glory in your flesh
but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord
for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision but a new creature
and whosoever shall follow this rule peace on them and mercy and
upon the israel of god
from henceforth let no man be troublesome to me for i bear the
marks of the lord jesus in my body
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit brethren
to worship but st paul having preached the gospel there for two years
the first time and afterwards for about a year converted many he wrote
this epistle to them when he was a prisoner in rome and sent it by
received and warns them and also those of the neighbouring cities
against the sophistry of philosophers and doctrine of false teachers who
were come among them the matters of faith contained in this epistle are
exceedingly sublime and consequently very difficult to be understood
