good but not of evil we must be slow to anger and not hearers only
but doers of the word of bridling the tongue and of pure religion
james the servant of god and of our lord jesus christ to the
twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting
my brethren count it all joy when you shall fall into divers
temptations
sometimes taken for trials by afflictions or persecutions as in this
place at other times it is to be understood tempting enticing or
drawing others into sin
knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience
and patience hath a perfect work that you may be perfect and
entire failing in nothing
but if any of you want wisdom let him ask of god who giveth to all
men abundantly and upbraideth not and it shall be given him
but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is
like a wave of the sea which is moved and carried about by the wind
therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of
the lord
a double minded man is inconstant in all his ways
but let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation
and the rich in his being low because as the flower of the grass
shall he pass away
for the sun rose with a burning heat and parched the grass and
the flower thereof fell off and the beauty of the shape thereof
perished so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways
blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he hath
been proved he shall receive the crown of life which god hath promised
to them that love him
let no man when he is tempted say that he is tempted by god for
but every man is tempted by his own concupiscence being drawn
away and allured
then when concupiscence hath conceived it bringeth forth sin
do not err therefore my dearest brethren
every best gift and every perfect gift is from above coming down
from the father of lights with whom there is no change nor shadow of
alteration
for of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth that
we might be some beginning of his creature
you know my dearest brethren and let every man be swift to hear
but slow to speak and slow to anger
for the anger of man worketh not the justice of god
wherefore casting away all uncleanness and abundance of
naughtiness with meekness receive the ingrafted word which is able to
save your souls
but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your
own selves
for if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he shall be
compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass
for he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what
manner of man he was
but he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath
continued therein not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the
work this man shall be blessed in his deed
and if any man think himself to be religious not bridling his
tongue but deceiving his own heart this mans religion is vain
religion clean and undefiled before god and the father is this to
visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep ones
self unspotted from this world
law faith is dead without works
my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ of glory
with respect of persons
faith the administering of the sacraments and other spiritual
functions in gods church there should be no respect of persons but
that the souls of the poor should be as much regarded as those of the
rich see deut
for if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden
ring in fine apparel and there shall come in also a poor man in mean
attire
and you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel
and shall say to him sit thou here well but say to the poor man stand
thou there or sit under my footstool
do you not judge within yourselves and are become judges of unjust
thoughts
hearken my dearest brethren hath not god chosen the poor in this
world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which god hath promised to
them that love him
but you have dishonoured the poor man do not the rich oppress you
by might and do not they draw you before the judgment seats
do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you
if then you fulfil the royal law according to the scriptures thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself you do well
but if you have respect to persons you commit sin being reproved
by the law as transgressors
and whosoever shall keep the whole law but offend in one point
is become guilty of all
manner that the observing of all other points will not avail him to
salvation for he despises the lawgiver and breaks through the great
and general commandment of charity even by one mortal sin for all the
precepts of the law are to be considered as one total and entire law
and as it were a chain of precepts where by breaking one link of this
chain the whole chain is broken or the integrity of the law consisting
of a collection of precepts a sinner therefore by a grievous offence
against any one precept incurs eternal punishment yet the punishment
in hell shall be greater for those who have been greater sinners as a
greater reward shall be for those in heaven who have lived with greater
sanctity and perfection
for he that said thou shalt not commit adultery said also thou
shalt not kill now if thou do not commit adultery but shalt kill thou
art become a transgressor of the law
so speak ye and so do as being to be judged by the law of
liberty
for judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy and
mercy exalteth itself above judgment
what shall it profit my brethren if a man say he hath faith but
hath not works shall faith be able to save him
and if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food
and one of you say to them go in peace be ye warmed and filled
yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body what
shall it profit
so faith also if it have not works is dead in itself
but some man will say thou hast faith and i have works shew me
thy faith without works and i will shew thee by works my faith
thou believest that there is one god thou dost well the devils
also believe and tremble
but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead
was not abraham our father justified by works offering up isaac
his son upon the altar
seest thou that faith did cooperate with his works and by works
faith was made perfect
and the scripture was fulfilled saying abraham believed god and
it was reputed to him to justice and he was called the friend of god
do you see that by works a man is justified and not by faith
only
and in like manner also rahab the harlot was not she justified by
works receiving the messengers and sending them out another way
for even as the body without the spirit is dead so also faith
without works is dead
heavenly wisdom
be ye not many masters my brethren knowing that you receive the
greater judgment
for in many things we all offend if any man offend not in word
the same is a perfect man he is able also with a bridle to lead about
the whole body
for if we put bits into the mouths of horses that they may obey
us and we turn about their whole body
behold also ships whereas they are great and are driven by strong
winds yet are they turned about with a small helm whithersoever the
force of the governor willeth
even so the tongue is indeed a little member and boasteth great
things behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood
and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity the tongue is placed
among our members which defileth the whole body and inflameth the wheel
of our nativity being set on fire by hell
for every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of the
rest is tamed and hath been tamed by the nature of man
but the tongue no man can tame an unquiet evil full of deadly
poison
by it we bless god and the father and by it we curse men who are
made after the likeness of god
out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my
brethren these things ought not so to be
doth a fountain send forth out of the same hole sweet and bitter
water
can the fig tree my brethren bear grapes or the vine figs so
neither can the salt water yield sweet
who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him
shew by a good contestation his work in the meekness of wisdom
but if you have bitter zeal and there be contention in your
hearts glory not and be not liars against the truth
for this is not wisdom descending from above but earthly
sensual devilish
for where envying and contention is there is inconstancy and
every evil work
but the wisdom that is from above first indeed is chaste then
peaceable modest easy to be persuaded consenting to the good full of
mercy and good fruits without judging without dissimulation
and the fruit of justice is sown in peace to them that make
peace
this world admonitions against pride detraction and the like
from whence are wars and contentions among you are they not hence
from your concupiscences which war in your members
you covet and have not you kill and envy and cannot obtain you
contend and war and you have not because you ask not
you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may
consume it on your concupiscences
adulterers know you not that the friendship of this world is the
enemy of god whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world
becometh an enemy of god
or do you think that the scripture saith in vain to envy doth the
spirit covet which dwelleth in you
but he giveth greater grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the
proud and giveth grace to the humble
be subject therefore to god but resist the devil and he will fly
from you
draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands
ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded
be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned into
mourning and your joy into sorrow
be humbled in the sight of the lord and he will exalt you
detract not one another my brethren he that detracteth his
brother or he that judgeth his brother detracteth the law and judgeth
the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but
a judge
there is one lawgiver and judge that is able to destroy and to
deliver
but who art thou that judgest thy neighbour behold now you that
say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and there we will
spend a year and will traffic and make our gain
whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow
for what is your life it is a vapour which appeareth for a little
while and afterwards shall vanish away for that you should say if the
but now you rejoice in your arrogancies all such rejoicing is
wicked
to him therefore who knoweth to do good and doth it not to him it
is sin
avoid swearing of the anointing the sick confession of sins and
fervour in prayer
go to now ye rich men weep and howl in your miseries which shall
come upon you
your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten
your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be for
a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire you have
stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days
behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields
which by fraud has been kept back by you crieth and the cry of them
hath entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth
you have feasted upon earth and in riotousness you have nourished
your hearts in the day of slaughter
you have condemned and put to death the just one and he resisted
you not
be patient therefore brethren until the coming of the lord
patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain
be you therefore also patient and strengthen your hearts for the
coming of the lord is at hand
grudge not brethren one against another that you may not be
judged behold the judge standeth before the door
take my brethren for example of suffering evil of labour and
patience the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord
behold we account them blessed who have endured you have heard
of the patience of job and you have seen the end of the lord that the
but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven
nor by the earth nor by any other oath but let your speech be yea
is any of you sad let him pray is he cheerful in mind let him
sing
is any man sick among you let him bring in the priests of the
church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of
the lord
sacrament of extreme unction that any controversy against its
institution would be against the express words of the sacred text in the
plainest terms
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick man and the lord
shall raise him up and if he be in sins they shall be forgiven him
confess therefore your sins one to another and pray one for
another that you may be saved for the continual prayer of a just man
availeth much
church whom ver he had ordered to be called for and brought in to
the sick moreover to confess to persons who had no power to forgive
sins would be useless hence the precept here means that we must
confess to men whom gkod hath appointed and who by their ordination
and jurisdiction have received the power of remitting sins in his name
elias was a man passible like unto us and with prayer he prayed
that it might not rain upon the earth and it rained not for three years
and six months
and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth
brought forth her fruit
my brethren if any of you err from the truth and one convert him
he must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the
error of his way shall save his soul from death and shall cover a
multitude of sins
concerning faith hope and charity with divers instructions to all
persons of what state or condition soever the apostle commands
submission to rulers and superiors and exhorts all to the practice of a
virtuous life in imitation of christ this epistle is written with such
apostolical dignity as to manifest the supreme authority with which its
writer the prince of the apostles had been vested by his lord and
