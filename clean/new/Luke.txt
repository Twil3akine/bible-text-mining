canticle of the blessed virgin the birth of the baptist and the
canticle of zachary
forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
narration of the things that have been accomplished among us
according as they have delivered them unto us who from the
beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word
it seemed good to me also having diligently attained to all things
from the beginning to write to thee in order most excellent
that thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast
been instructed
there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest
named zachary of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters
of aaron and her name elizabeth
functions of a whole week for by the appointment of david par
the descendants from aaron were divided into twentyfour families of
which the eighth was abia from whom descended this zachary who at this
time was in the week of his priestly functions
and they were both just before god walking in all the commandments
and justifications of the lord without blame
and they had no son for that elizabeth was barren and they both
were well advanced in years
and it came to pass when he executed the priestly function in the
order of his course before god
according to the custom of the priestly office it was his lot to
offer incense going into the temple of the lord
and all the multitude of the people was praying without at the
hour of incense
and there appeared to him an angel of the lord standing on the
right side of the altar of incense
and zachary seeing him was troubled and fear fell upon him
but the angel said to him fear not zachary for thy prayer is
heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt
call his name john
and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice in
his nativity
for he shall be great before the lord and shall drink no wine nor
strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his
mothers womb
and he shall convert many of the children of israel to the lord
their god
and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias that
he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children and the
incredulous to the wisdom of the just to prepare unto the lord a
perfect people
and zachary said to the angel whereby shall i know this for i
am an old man and my wife is advanced in years
and the angel answering said to him i am gabriel who stand
before god and am sent to speak to thee and to bring thee these good
tidings
and behold thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be able to speak
until the day wherein these things shall come to pass because thou hast
not believed my words which shall be fulfilled in their time
and the people were waiting for zachary and they wondered that he
tarried so long in the temple
and when he came out he could not speak to them and they
understood that he had seen a vision in the temple and he made signs to
them and remained dumb
and it came to pass after the days of his office were
accomplished he departed to his own house
and after those days elizabeth his wife conceived and hid herself
five months saying
thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had
regard to take away my reproach among men
and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into a
city of galilee called nazareth
to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house
of david and the virgins name was mary
and the angel being come in said unto her hail full of grace
the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women
who having heard was troubled at his saying and thought with
herself what manner of salutation this should be
and the angel said to her fear not mary for thou hast found
grace with god
behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a
son and thou shalt call his name jesus
he shall be great and shall be called the son of the most high
he shall reign in the house of jacob for ever
and of his kingdom there shall be no end
and mary said to the angel how shall this be done because i know
not man
and the angel answering said to her the holy ghost shall come
upon thee and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee and
therefore also the holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the
and behold thy cousin elizabeth she also hath conceived a son in
her old age and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren
because no word shall be impossible with god
and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it done to me
according to thy word and the angel departed from her
and mary rising up in those days went into the hill country with
haste into a city of juda
and she entered into the house of zachary and saluted elizabeth
and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of
and she cried out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to
me
for behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my
ears the infant in my womb leaped for joy
and blessed art thou that hast believed because those things
shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the lord
and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord
and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour
because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid for behold
from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed
which the church in all ages should pay to the blessed virgin let
because he that is mighty hath done great things to me and holy
is his name
and his mercy is from generation unto generations to them that
fear him
he hath shewed might in his arm he hath scattered the proud in
the conceit of their heart
he hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the
humble
he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath
sent empty away
he hath received israel his servant being mindful of his mercy
as he spoke to our fathers to abraham and to his seed for ever
and mary abode with her about three months and she returned to
her own house
now elizabeths full time of being delivered was come and she
brought forth a son
and her neighbors and kinsfolks heard that the lord had shewed his
great mercy towards her and they congratulated with her
and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise
the child and they called him by his fathers name zachary
and his mother answering said not so but he shall be called
and they said to her there is none of thy kindred that is called
by this name
and they made signs to his father how he would have him called
and demanding a writing table he wrote saying john is his name
and immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and he
spoke blessing god
and fear came upon all their neighbours and all these things were
noised abroad over all the hill country of judea
and all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart
saying what an one think ye shall this child be for the hand of the
and zachary his father was filled with the holy ghost and he
prophesied saying
blessed be the lord god of israel because he hath visited and
wrought the redemption of his people
and hath raised up an horn of salvation to us in the house of
translates it for in the scripture by horn is generally understood
strength and power
as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who are from the
beginning
salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us
to perform mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy
testament
the oath which he swore to abraham our father that he would
grant to us
that being delivered from the hand of our enemies we may serve
him without fear
in holiness and justice before him all our days
and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest for
thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways
to give knowledge of salvation to his people unto the remission
of their sins
through the bowels of the mercy of our god in which the orient
from on high hath visited us
the world and the sun of justice
to enlighten them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death
to direct our feet into the way of peace
and the child grew and was strengthened in spirit and was in the
deserts until the day of his manifestation to israel
and it came to pass that in those days there went out a decree from
this enrolling was first made by cyrinus the governor of syria
and all went to be enrolled every one into his own city
and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth
into judea to the city of david which is called bethlehem because he
was of the house and family of david
to be enrolled with mary his espoused wife who was with child
and it came to pass that when they were there her days were
accomplished that she should be delivered
and she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him up in
swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room
for them in the inn
child but it is a way of speech among the hebrews to call them also
the firstborn who are the only children see annotation matt
and there were in the same country shepherds watching and keeping
the night watches over their flock
and behold an angel of the lord stood by them and the brightness of
and the angel said to them fear not for behold i bring you
good tidings of great joy that shall be to all the people
for this day is born to you a saviour who is christ the lord in
the city of david
and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the infant
wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger
and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
army praising god and saying
glory to god in the highest and on earth peace to men of good
will
and it came to pass after the angels departed from them into
heaven the shepherds said one to another let us go over to bethlehem
and let us see this word that is come to pass which the lord hath
shewed to us
and they came with haste and they found mary and joseph and the
infant lying in the manger
and seeing they understood of the word that had been spoken to
them concerning this child
and all that heard wondered and at those things that were told
them by the shepherds
but mary kept all these words pondering them in her heart
and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all
the things they had heard and seen as it was told unto them
and after eight days were accomplished that the child should be
circumcised his name was called jesus which was called by the angel
before he was conceived in the womb
and after the days of her purification according to the law of
to the lord
as it is written in the law of the lord every male opening the
womb shall be called holy to the lord
and to offer a sacrifice according as it is written in the law of
the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
and behold there was a man in jerusalem named simeon and this man
was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy
and he had received an answer from the holy ghost that he should
not see death before he had seen the christ of the lord
and he came by the spirit into the temple and when his parents
brought in the child jesus to do for him according to the custom of the
law
he also took him into his arms and blessed god and said
now thou dost dismiss thy servant o lord according to thy word
in peace
because my eyes have seen thy salvation
which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples
a light to the revelation of the gentiles and the glory of thy
people israel
and his father and mother were wondering at those things which
were spoken concerning him
and simeon blessed them and said to mary his mother behold this
child is set for the fall and for the resurrection of many in israel and
for a sign which shall be contradicted
wilful blindness and obstinacy would not believe in christ nor receive
his doctrine which therefore would be ruin to them but to others a
resurrection by their believing in him and obeying his commandments
and thy own soul a sword shall pierce that out of many hearts
thoughts may be revealed
and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of
the tribe of aser she was far advanced in years and had lived with her
husband seven years from her virginity
and she was a widow until fourscore and four years who departed
not from the temple by fastings and prayers serving night and day
now she at the same hour coming in confessed to the lord and
spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of israel
and after they had performed all things according to the law of
the lord they returned into galilee to their city nazareth
and the child grew and waxed strong full of wisdom and the grace
of god was in him
and his parents went every year to jerusalem at the solemn day of
the pasch
and when he was twelve years old they going up into jerusalem
according to the custom of the feast
and having fulfilled the days when they returned the child jesus
remained in jerusalem and his parents knew it not
and thinking that he was in the company they came a days journey
and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance
and not finding him they returned into jerusalem seeking him
and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the
temple sitting in the midst of the doctors hearing them and asking
them questions
and all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his
answers
and seeing him they wondered and his mother said to him son
why hast thou done so to us behold thy father and i have sought thee
sorrowing
and he said to them how is it that you sought me did you not
know that i must be about my fathers business
and they understood not the word that he spoke unto them
and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject to
them and his mother kept all these words in her heart
and jesus advanced in wisdom and age and grace with god and men
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius
and lysanias tetrarch of abilina
under the high priests anna and caiphas the word of the lord was
made unto john the son of zachary in the desert
and he came into all the country about the jordan preaching the
baptism of penance for the remission of sins
as it was written in the book of the sayings of isaias the prophet
make straight his paths
every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be
brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways
plain
and all flesh shall see the salvation of god
he said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be baptized
by him ye offspring of vipers who hath shewed you to flee from the
wrath to come
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of penance and do not begin to
say we have abraham for our father for i say unto you that god is able
of these stones to raise up children to abraham
for now the axe is laid to the root of the trees every tree
therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be cut down and cast
into the fire
and the people asked him saying what then shall we do
and he answering said to them he that hath two coats let him
give to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do in like
manner
and the publicans also came to be baptized and said to him
but he said to them do nothing more than that which is appointed
you
and the soldiers also asked him saying and what shall we do and
he said to them do violence to no man neither calumniate any man and
be content with your pay
and as the people were of opinion and all were thinking in their
hearts of john that perhaps he might be the christ
john answered saying unto all i indeed baptize you with water
but there shall come one mightier than i the latchet of whose shoes i
am not worthy to loose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and
with fire
whose fan is in his hand and he will purge his floor and will
gather the wheat into his barn but the chaff he will burn with
unquenchable fire
and many other things exhorting did he preach to the people
but herod the tetrarch when he was reproved by him for herodias
his brothers wife and for all the evils which herod had done
he added this also above all and shut up john in prison
now it came to pass when all the people were baptized that jesus
also being baptized and praying heaven was opened
and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape as a dove upon
him and a voice came from heaven thou art my beloved son in thee i am
well pleased
and jesus himself was beginning about the age of thirty years
being as it was supposed the son of joseph who was of heli who was
of mathat
dying without issue jacob as the law directed married his widow in
consequence of such marriage his son joseph was reputed in the law the
son of heli
who was of levi who was of melchi who was of janne who was of
who was of mathathias who was of amos who was of nahum who was
of hesli who was of nagge
who was of mahath who was of mathathias who was of semei who
was of joseph who was of juda
who was of joanna who was of reza who was of zorobabel who was
of salathiel who was of neri
who was of melchi who was of addi who was of cosan who was of
who was of jesus who was of eliezer who was of jorim who was of
who was of simeon who was of judas who was of joseph who was of
who was of melea who was of menna who was of mathatha who was
of nathan who was of david
who was of jesse who was of obed who was of booz who was of
who was of aminadab who was of aram who was of esron who was of
who was of jacob who was of isaac who was of abraham who was of
who was of sarug who was of ragau who was of phaleg who was of
who was of cainan who was of arphaxad who was of sem who was of
who was of mathusale who was of henoch who was of jared who was
of malaleel who was of cainan
who was of henos who was of seth who was of adam who was of
miracles in capharnaum
and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from the jordan
and was led by the spirit into the desert
for the space of forty days and was tempted by the devil and he
ate nothing in those days and when they were ended he was hungry
and the devil said to him if thou be the son of god say to this
stone that it be made bread
and jesus answered him is written that man liveth not by bread
alone but by every word of god
and the devil led him into a high mountain and shewed him all the
kingdoms of the world in a moment of time
and he said to him to thee will i give all this power and the
glory of them for to me they are delivered and to whom i will i give
them
if thou therefore wilt adore before me all shall be thine
and jesus answering said to him it is written thou shalt adore
the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the
temple and said to him if thou be the son of god cast thyself from
hence
for it is written that he hath given his angels charge over thee
that they keep thee
and that in their hands they shall bear thee up lest perhaps thou
dash thy foot against a stone
and jesus answering said to him it is said thou shalt not tempt
the lord thy god
and all the temptation being ended the devil departed from him
for a time
and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and
the fame of him went out through the whole country
and he taught in their synagogues and was magnified by all
and he came to nazareth where he was brought up and he went into
the synagogue according to his custom on the sabbath day and he rose
up to read
and the book of isaias the prophet was delivered unto him and as
he unfolded the book he found the place where it was written
the spirit of the lord is upon me wherefore he hath anointed me
to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the contrite
of heart
to preach deliverance to the captives and sight to the blind to
set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of
the lord and the day of reward
and when he had folded the book he restored it to the minister
and sat down and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him
and he began to say to them this day is fulfilled this scripture
in your ears
and all gave testimony to him and they wondered at the words of
grace that proceeded from his mouth and they said is not this the son
of joseph
and he said to them doubtless you will say to me this similitude
and he said amen i say to you that no prophet is accepted in his
own country
in truth i say to you there were many widows in the days of elias
in israel when heaven was shut up three years and six months when
there was a great famine throughout all the earth
and to none of them was elias sent but to sarepta of sidon to a
widow woman
and there were many lepers in israel in the time of eliseus the
prophet and none of them was cleansed but naaman the syrian
and all they in the synagogue hearing these things were filled
with anger
and they rose up and thrust him out of the city and they brought
him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they
might cast him down headlong
but he passing through the midst of them went his way
and he went down into capharnaum a city of galilee and there he
taught them on the sabbath days
and they were astonished at his doctrine for his speech was with
power
and in the synagogue there was a man who had an unclean devil and
he cried out with a loud voice
saying let us alone what have we to do with thee jesus of
holy one of god
and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and go out of him
hurt him not at all
and there came fear upon all and they talked among themselves
saying what word is this for with authority and power he commandeth
the unclean spirits and they go out
and the fame of him was published into every place of the country
and jesus rising up out of the synagogue went into simons house
besought him for her
and standing over her he commanded the fever and it left her
and when the sun was down all they that had any sick with divers
diseases brought them to him but he laying his hands on every one of
them healed them
and devils went out from many crying out and saying thou art the
son of god and rebuking them he suffered them not to speak for they
knew that he was christ
and when it was day going out he went into a desert place and
the multitudes sought him and came unto him and they stayed him that
should not depart from them
to whom he said to other cities also i must preach the kingdom of
and he was preaching in the synagogues of galilee
paralytic the call of matthew
and it came to pass that when the multitudes pressed upon him to
hear the word of god he stood by the lake of genesareth
and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone
out of them and were washing their nets
and going into one of the ships that was simons he desired him to
draw back a little from the land and sitting he taught the multitudes
out of the ship
now when he had ceased to speak he said to simon launch out into
the deep and let down your nets for a draught
and simon answering said to him master we have laboured all the
night and have taken nothing but at thy word i will let down the net
and when they had done this they enclosed a very great multitude
of fishes and their net broke
and they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship
that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the
ships so that they were almost sinking
which when simon peter saw he fell down at jesus knees saying
for he was wholly astonished and all that were with him at the
draught of the fishes which they had taken
and so were also james and john the sons of zebedee who were
thou shalt catch men
and having brought their ships to land leaving all things they
followed him
and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man
full of leprosy who seeing jesus and falling on his face besought him
saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and stretching forth his hand he touched him saying i will be
thou cleansed and immediately the leprosy departed from him
and he charged him that he should tell no man but go shew
thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses
commanded for a testimony to them
but the fame of him went abroad the more and great multitudes
came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities
and he retired into the desert and prayed
and it came to pass on a certain day as he sat teaching that
there were also pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by that were
come out of every town of galilee and judea and jerusalem and the power
of the lord was to heal them
and behold men brought in a bed a man who had the palsy and they
sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
because of the multitude they went up upon the roof and let him down
through the tiles with his bed into the midst before jesus
whose faith when he saw he said man thy sins are forgiven thee
and the scribes and pharisees began to think saying who is this
who speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
and when jesus knew their thoughts answering he said to them
which is easier to say thy sins are forgiven thee or to say
but that you may know that the son of man hath the power on earth
to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy i say to thee to
and immediately rising up before them he took up the bed on which
he lay and he went away to his own house glorifying god
and all were astonished and they glorified god and they were
filled with fear saying we have seen wonderful things today
and after these things he went forth and saw a publican named
and leaving all things he rose up and followed him
and levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a
great company of publicans and of others that were at table with them
but the pharisees and scribes murmured saying to his disciples
and jesus answering said to them they that are whole need not
the physician but they that are sick
i came not to call the just but sinners to penance
and they said to him why do the disciples of john fast often and
make prayers and the disciples of the pharisees in like manner but
thine eat and drink
to whom he said can you make the children of the bridegroom fast
whilst the bridegroom is with them
but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them then shall they fast in those days
and he spoke also a similitude to them that no man putteth a
piece from a new garment upon an old garment otherwise he both rendeth
the new and the piece taken from the new agreeth not with the old
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles otherwise the new
wine will break the bottles and it will be spilled and the bottles will
be lost
but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved
and no man drinking old hath presently a mind to new for he
saith the old is better
twelve and makes a sermon to them
and it came to pass on the second first sabbath that as he went
through the corn fields his disciples plucked the ears and did eat
rubbing them in their hands
others of a sabbath day that immediately followed any solemn feast
and some of the pharisees said to them why do you that which is
not lawful on the sabbath days
and jesus answering them said have you not read so much as this
what david did when himself was hungry and they that were with him
how he went into the house of god and took and ate the bread of
proposition and gave to them that were with him which is not lawful to
eat but only for the priests
and he said to them the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
and it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into
the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was
withered
and the scribes and pharisees watched if he would heal on the
sabbath that they might find an accusation against him
but he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered
hand arise and stand forth in the midst and rising he stood forth
then jesus said to them i ask you if it be lawful on the sabbath
days to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy
and looking round about on them all he said to the man stretch
forth thy hand and he stretched it forth and his hand was restored
and they were filled with madness and they talked one with
another what they might do to jesus
and it came to pass in those days that he went out into a
mountain to pray and he passed the whole night in the prayer of god
and when day was come he called unto him his disciples and he
chose twelve of them whom also he named apostles
simon whom he surnamed peter and andrew his brother james and
matthew and thomas james the son of alpheus and simon who is
called zelotes
and jude the brother of james and judas iscariot who was the
traitor
and coming down with them he stood in a plain place and the
company of his disciples and a very great multitude of people from all
who were come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and
they that were troubled with unclean spirits were cured
and all the multitude sought to touch him for virtue went out
from him and healed all
and he lifting up his eyes on his disciples said blessed are ye
poor for yours is the kingdom of god
blessed are ye that hunger now for you shall be filled blessed
are ye that weep now for you shall laugh
blessed shall you be when men shall hate you and when they shall
separate you and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for
the son of mans sake
be glad in that day and rejoice for behold your reward is great
in heaven for according to these things did their fathers to the
prophets
but woe to you that are rich for you have your consolation
woe to you that are filled for you shall hunger woe to you that
now laugh for you shall mourn and weep
woe to you when men shall bless you for according to these things
did their fathers to the false prophets
but i say to you that hear love your enemies do good to them
that hate you
bless them that curse you and pray for them that calumniate you
and to him that striketh thee on the one cheek offer also the
other and him that taketh away from thee thy cloak forbid not to take
thy coat also
give to every one that asketh thee and of him that taketh away
thy goods ask them not again
and as you would that men should do to you do you also to them in
like manner
and if you love them that love you what thanks are to you for
sinners also love those that love them
and if you do good to them who do good to you what thanks are to
you for sinners also do this
and if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what thanks
are to you for sinners also lend to sinners for to receive as much
but love ye your enemies do good and lend hoping for nothing
thereby and your reward shall be great and you shall be the sons of
the highest for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil
be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful
judge not and you shall not be judged condemn not and you shall
not be condemned forgive and you shall be forgiven
give and it shall be given to you good measure and pressed down
and shaken together and running over shall they give into your bosom
measured to you again
and he spoke also to them a similitude can the blind lead the
blind do they not both fall into the ditch
the disciple is not above his master but every one shall be
perfect if he be as his master
and why seest thou the mote in thy brothers eye but the beam
that is in thy own eye thou considerest not
or how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull the
mote out of thy eye when thou thyself seest not the beam in thy own
eye hypocrite cast first the beam out of thy own eye and then shalt
thou see clearly to take out the mote from thy brothers eye
for there is no good tree that bringeth forth evil fruit nor an
evil tree that bringeth forth good fruit
for every tree is known by its fruit for men do not gather figs
from thorns nor from a bramble bush do they gather the grape
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth
that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth
forth that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth speaketh
and why call you me lord lord and do not the things which i
say
every one that cometh to me and heareth my words and doth them i
will shew you to whom he is like
he is like to a man building a house who digged deep and laid the
foundation upon a rock and when a flood came the stream beat
vehemently upon that house and it could not shake it for it was
founded on a rock
but he that heareth and doth not is like to a man building his
house upon the earth without a foundation against which the stream beat
vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was
great
answers the messengers sent by john and absolves the penitent sinner
and when he had finished all his words in the hearing of the
people he entered into capharnaum
and the servant of a certain centurion who was dear to him being
sick was ready to die
and when he had heard of jesus he sent unto him the ancients of
the jews desiring him to come and heal his servant
and when they came to jesus they besought him earnestly saying to
him he is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him
for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue
and jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the
house the centurion sent his friends to him saying lord trouble not
thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof
for which cause neither did i think myself worthy to come to thee
but say the word and my servant shall be healed
for i also am a man subject to authority having under me soldiers
and i say to one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh
and to my servant do this and he doth it
which jesus hearing marvelled and turning about to the multitude
that followed him he said amen i say to you i have not found so great
faith not even in israel
and they who were sent being returned to the house found the
servant whole who had been sick
and it came to pass afterwards that he went into a city that is
called naim and there went with him his disciples and a great
multitude
and when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold a dead man
was carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and a
great multitude of the city was with her
whom when the lord had seen being moved with mercy towards her
he said to her weep not
and he came near and touched the bier and they that carried it
stood still and he said young man i say to thee arise
and he that was dead sat up and begun to speak and he gave him to
his mother
and there came a fear upon them all and they glorified god
saying a great prophet is risen up among us and god hath visited his
people
and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judea and
throughout all the country round about
and johns disciples told him of all these things
and john called to him two of his disciples and sent them to
and when the men were come unto him they said john the baptist
hath sent us to thee saying art thou he that art to come or look we
for another
and in that same hour he cured many of their diseases and hurts
and evil spirits and to many that were blind he gave sight
and answering he said to them go and relate to john what you
have heard and seen the blind see the lame walk the lepers are made
clean the deaf hear the dead rise again to the poor the gospel is
preached
and blessed is he whosoever shall not be scandalized in me
and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speak
to the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the desert to
see a reed shaken with the wind
but what went you out to see a man clothed in soft garments
houses of kings
but what went you out to see a prophet yea i say to you and
more than a prophet
this is he of whom it is written behold i send my angel before
thy face who shall prepare thy way before thee
for i say to you amongst those that are born of men there is not
a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is the lesser in
the kingdom of god is greater than he
and all the people hearing and the publicans justified god
being baptized with johns baptism
worshipped god as just and merciful
but the pharisees and the lawyers despised the counsel of god
against themselves being not baptized by him
and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of this
generation and to what are they like
they are like to children sitting in the marketplace and speaking
one to another and saying we have piped to you and you have not
danced we have mourned and you have not wept
for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
the son of man is come eating and drinking and you say behold a
man that is a glutton and a drinker of wine a friend of publicans and
sinners
and wisdom is justified by all her children
and one of the pharisees desired him to eat with him and he went
into the house of the pharisee and sat down to meat
and behold a woman that was in the city a sinner when she knew
that he sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of
ointment
and standing behind at his feet she began to wash his feet with
tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and
anointed them with the ointment
and the pharisee who had invited him seeing it spoke within
himself saying this man if he were if a prophet would know surely
who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him that she is a
sinner
and jesus answering said to him simon i have somewhat to say to
thee but he said master say it
a certain creditor had two debtors the one owed five hundred
pence and the other fifty
and whereas they had not wherewith to pay he forgave them both
simon answering said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most
and turning to the woman he said unto simon dost thou see this
woman i entered into thy house thou gavest me no water for my feet
them
thou gavest me no kiss but she since she cane in hath not
ceased to kiss my feet
my head with oil thou didst not anoint but she with ointment hath
anointed my feet
wherefore i say to thee many sins are forgiven her because she
hath loved much but to whom less is forgiven he loveth less
scripture an effect sometimes seems attributed to one only cause when
there are divers other concurring dispositions for the sins of this
woman in this verse are said to be forgiven because she loved much
but ver christ tells her thy faith hath made thee safe hence in
a true conversion are joined faith hope love sorrow for sin and
other pious dispositions
and he said to her thy sins are forgiven thee
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves
and he said to the woman thy faith hath made thee safe go in
peace
legion heals the issue of blood and raises the daughter of jairus to
life
and it came to pass afterwards he travelled through the cities and
towns preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of god and the twelve
with him
and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and
infirmities mary who is called magdalen out of whom seven devils were
gone forth
and joanna the wife of chusa herods steward and susanna and many
others who ministered unto him of their substance
and when a very great multitude was gathered together and hastened
out of the cities unto him he spoke by a similitude
the sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by
the way side and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured
it
and other some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up
it withered away because it had no moisture
and other some fell among thorns and the thorns growing up with
it choked it
and other some fell upon good ground and being sprung up yielded
fruit a hundredfold saying these things he cried out he that hath
ears to hear let him hear
and his disciples asked him what this parable might be
to whom he said to you it is given to know the mystery of the
kingdom of god but to the rest in parables that seeing they may not
see and hearing may not understand
now the parable is this the seed is the word of god
and they by the way side are they that hear then the devil cometh
and taketh the word out of their heart lest believing they should be
saved
now they upon the rock are they who when they hear receive the
word with joy and these have no roots for they believe for a while and
in time of temptation they fall away
and that which fell among thorns are they who have heard and
going their way are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of
this life and yield no fruit
but that on the good ground are they who in a good and perfect
heart hearing the word keep it and bring forth fruit in patience
now no man lighting a candle covereth it with a vessel or putteth
it under a bed but setteth it upon a candlestick that they who come in
may see the light
for there is not any thing secret that shall not be made manifest
nor hidden that shall not be known and come abroad
take heed therefore how you hear for whosoever hath to him shall
be given and whosoever hath not that also which he thinketh he hath
shall be taken away from him
and his mother and brethren came unto him and they could not come
at him for the crowd
and it was told him thy mother and thy brethren stand without
desiring to see thee
who answering said to them my mother and my brethren are they
who hear the word of god and do it
and it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a little
ship with his disciples and he said to them let us go over to the
other side of the lake and they launched forth
and when they were sailing he slept and there came down a storm
of wind upon the lake and they were filled and were in danger
and they came and awaked him saying master we perish but he
arising rebuked the wind and the rage of the water and it ceased and
there was a calm
and he said to them where is your faith who being afraid
wondered saying one to another who is this think you that he
commandeth both the winds and the sea and they obey him
and they sailed to the country of the gerasens which is over
against galilee
and when he was come forth to the land there met him a certain
man who had a devil now a very long time and he wore no clothes
neither did he abide in a house but in the sepulchres
and when he saw jesus he fell down before him and crying out
with a loud voice he said what have i to do with thee jesus son of
the most high god i beseech thee do not torment me
for he commanded the unclean spirit to go out of the man for
many times it seized him and he was bound with chains and kept in
fetters and breaking the bonds he was driven by the devil into the
deserts
and jesus asked him saying what is thy name but he said
and they besought him that he would not command them to go into
the abyss
and there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain
and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and
he suffered them
the devils therefore went out of the man and entered into the
swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and
were stifled
which when they that fed them saw done they fled away and told it
in the city and in the villages
and they went out to see what was done and they came to jesus and
found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at his feet
clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
and they also that had seen told them how he had been healed from
the legion
and all the multitude of the country of the gerasens besought him
to depart from them for they were taken with great fear and he going
up into the ship returned back again
now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that
he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying
return to thy house and tell how great things god hath done to
thee and he went through the whole city publishing how great things
and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the multitude
received him for they were all waiting for him
and behold there came a man whose name was jairus and he was a
ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at the feet of jesus
beseeching him that he would come into his house
for he had an only daughter almost twelve years old and she was
dying and it happened as he went that he was thronged by the
multitudes
and there was a certain woman having an issue of blood twelve
years who had bestowed all her substance on physicians and could not be
healed by any
she came behind him and touched the hem of his garment and
immediately the issue of her blood stopped
and jesus said who is it that touched me and all denying peter
and they that were with him said master the multitudes throng and
press thee and dost thou say who touched me
and jesus said somebody hath touched me for i know that virtue
is gone out from me
and the woman seeing that she was not hid came trembling and fell
down before his feet and declared before all the people for what cause
she had touched him and how she was immediately healed
but he said to her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go
thy way in peace
as he was yet speaking there cometh one to the ruler of the
synagogue saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble him not
and jesus hearing this word answered the father of the maid fear
not believe only and she shall be safe
and when he was come to the house he suffered not any man to go
in with him but peter and james and john and the father and mother of
the maiden
and all wept and mourned for her but he said weep not the maid
is not dead but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead
but he taking her by the hand cried out saying maid arise
and her spirit returned and she arose immediately and he bid
them give her to eat
and her parents were astonished whom he charged to tell no man
what was done
is transfigured and casts out a devil
then calling together the twelve apostles he gave them power and
authority over all devils and to cure diseases
and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick
and he said to them take nothing for your journey neither staff
nor scrip nor bread nor money neither have two coats
and whatsoever house you shall enter into abide there and depart
not from thence
and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city
shake off even the dust of your feet for a testimony against them
and going out they went about through the towns preaching the
gospel and healing every where
now herod the tetrarch heard of all things that were done by him
by some that john was risen from the dead but by other some that
risen again
and herod said john i have beheaded but who is this of whom i
hear such things and he sought to see him
and the apostles when they were returned told him all they had
done and taking them he went aside into a desert place apart which
belongeth to bethsaida
which when the people knew they followed him and he received
them and spoke to them of the kingdom of god and healed them who had
need of healing
now the day began to decline and the twelve came and said to him
about they may lodge and get victuals for we are here in a desert
place
but he said to them give you them to eat and they said we have
no more than five loaves and two fishes unless perhaps we should go
and buy food for all this multitude
now there were about five thousand men and he said to his
disciples make them sit down by fifties in a company
and they did so and made them all sit down
and taking the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to
heaven and blessed them and he broke and distributed to his disciples
to set before the multitude
and they did all eat and were filled and there were taken up of
fragments that remained to them twelve baskets
and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples also
were with him and he asked them saying whom do the people say that i
am
but they answered and said john the baptist but some say elias
and others say that one of the former prophets is risen again
and he said to them but whom do you say that i am simon peter
answering said the christ of god
but he strictly charging them commanded they should tell this to
no man
saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by
the ancients and chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third
day rise again
and he said to all if any man will come after me let him deny
himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it for he that shall
lose his life for my sake shall save it
for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose
himself and cast away himself
for he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him the son
of man shall be ashamed when he shall come in his majesty and that of
his father and of the holy angels
but i tell you of a truth there are some standing here that shall
not taste death till they see the kingdom of god
and it came to pass about eight days after these words that he
took peter and james and john and went up into a mountain to pray
and whilst he prayed the shape of his countenance was altered and
his raiment became white and glittering
and behold two men were talking with him and they were moses and
appearing in majesty and they spoke of his decease that he should
accomplish in jerusalem
but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and
waking they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him
and it came to pass that as they were departing from him peter
saith to jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make
three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias
not knowing what he said
and as he spoke these things there came a cloud and overshadowed
them and they were afraid when they entered into the cloud
and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son
and whilst the voice was uttered jesus was found alone and they
held their peace and told no man in those days any of these things which
they had seen
and it came to pass the day following when they came down from
the mountain there met him a great multitude
and behold a man among the crowd cried out saying master i
beseech thee look upon my son because he is my only one
and lo a spirit seizeth him and he suddenly crieth out and he
throweth him down and teareth him so that he foameth and bruising him
he hardly departeth from him
and i desired thy disciples to cast him out and they could not
and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation
how long shall i be with you and suffer you bring hither thy son
and as he was coming to him the devil threw him down and tore
him
and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and cured the boy and
restored him to his father
and all were astonished at the mighty power of god but while all
wondered at all the things he did he said to his disciples lay you up
in your hearts these words for it shall come to pass that the son of
man shall be delivered into the hands of men
but they understood not this word and it was hid from them so
that they perceived it not and they were afraid to ask him concerning
this word
and there entered a thought into them which of them should be
greater
but jesus seeing the thoughts of their hearts took a child and
set him by him
and said to them whosoever shall receive this child in my name
receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me
and john answering said master we saw a certain man casting
out devils in thy name and we forbade him because he followeth not
with us
and jesus said to him forbid him not for he that is not against
you is for you
and it came to pass when the days of his assumption were
accomplishing that he steadfastly set his face to go to jerusalem
and he sent messengers before his face and going they entered
into a city of the samaritans to prepare for him
and they received him not because his face was of one going to
and when his disciples james and john had seen this they said
consume them
and turning he rebuked them saying you know not of what spirit
you are
the son of man came not to destroy souls but to save and they
went into another town
and it came to pass as they walked in the way that a certain man
said to him i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
jesus said to him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air
nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
but he said to another follow me and he said lord suffer me
first to go and to bury my father
and jesus said to him let the dead bury their dead but go thou
and preach the kingdom of god
and another said i will follow thee lord but let me first take
my leave of them that are at my house
jesus said to him no man putting his hand to the plough and
looking back is fit for the kingdom of god
and after these things the lord appointed also other seventytwo
whither he himself was to come
and he said to them the harvest indeed is great but the
labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he
send labourers into his harvest
go behold i send you as lambs among wolves
carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man by
the way
into whatever house you enter first say peace be to this house
and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon him
but if not it shall return to you
and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as
they have for the labourer is worthy of his hire remove not from
house to house
and into what city soever you enter and they receive you eat
such things as are set before you
and heal the sick that are therein and say to them the kingdom of
but into whatsoever city you enter and they receive you not
going forth into the streets thereof say
even the very dust of your city that cleaveth to us we wipe off
against you yet know this that the kingdom of god is at hand
i say to you it shall be more tolerable at that day for sodom
than for that city
woe to thee corozain woe to thee bethsaida for if in tyre and
they would have done penance long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes
but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment
than for you
and thou capharnaum which art exalted unto heaven thou shalt
be thrust down to hell
he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you
despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me
and the seventytwo returned with joy saying lord the devils
also are subject to us in thy name
and he said to them i saw satan like lightning falling from
heaven
behold i have given you power to tread upon serpents and
scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy and nothing shall hurt
you
but yet rejoice not in this that spirits are subject unto you
but rejoice in this that your names are written in heaven
in that same hour he rejoiced in the holy ghost and said i
confess to thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast
hidden these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them to
little ones yea father for so it hath seemed good in thy sight
rejoiced in the holy ghost and gave thanks to his eternal father
all things are delivered to me by my father and no one knoweth
who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and
to whom the son will reveal him
and turning to his disciples he said blessed are the eyes that
see the things which you see
for i say to you that many prophets and kings have desired to see
the things that you see and have not seen them and to hear the things
that you hear and have not heard them
and behold a certain lawyer stood up tempting him and saying
but he said to him what is written in the law how readest thou
he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with thy
whole heart and with thy whole soul and with all thy strength and with
all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself
and he said to him thou hast answered right this do and thou
shalt live
but he willing to justify himself said to jesus and who is my
neighbour
and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem
to jericho and fell among robbers who also stripped him and having
wounded him went away leaving him half dead
and it chanced that a certain priest went down the same way and
seeing him passed by
in like manner also a levite when he was near the place and saw
him passed by
but a certain samaritan being on his journey came near him and
seeing him was moved with compassion
and going up to him bound up his wounds pouring in oil and
wine and setting him upon his own beast brought him to an inn and took
care of him
and the next day he took out two pence and gave to the host and
said take care of him and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above
which of these three in thy opinion was neighbour to him that
fell among the robbers
but he said he that shewed mercy to him and jesus said to him
now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain
town and a certain woman named martha received him into her house
and she had a sister called mary who sitting also at the lords
feet heard his word
but martha was busy about much serving who stood and said lord
hast thou no care that my sister hath left me alone to serve speak to
her therefore that she help me
and the lord answering said to her martha martha thou art
careful and art troubled about many things
but one thing is necessary mary hath chosen the best part which
shall not be taken away from her
confutes the pharisees and pronounces woes against them for their
hypocrisy
and it came to pass that as he was in a certain place praying
when he ceased one of his disciples said to him lord teach us to
pray as john also taught his disciples
and he said to them when you pray say father hallowed be thy
name thy kingdom come
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is
indebted to us and lead us not into temptation
and he said to them which of you shall have a friend and shall go
to him at midnight and shall say to him friend lend me three loaves
because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me and i have
not what to set before him
and he from within should answer and say trouble me not the door
is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give
thee
yet if he shall continue knocking i say to you although he will
not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his
importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth
and i say to you ask and it shall be given you seek and you
shall find knock and it shall be opened to you
for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
and which of you if he ask his father bread will he give him a
stone or a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent
or if he shall ask an egg will he reach him a scorpion
if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your
children how much more will your father from heaven give the good
and he was casting out a devil and the same was dumb and when
he had cast out the devil the dumb spoke and the multitudes were in
admiration at it
but some of them said he casteth out devils by beelzebub the
prince of devils
and others tempting asked of him a sign from heaven
but he seeing their thoughts said to them every kingdom divided
against itself shall be brought to desolation and house upon house
shall fall
and if satan also be divided against himself how shall his
kingdom stand because you say that through beelzebub i cast out devils
now if i cast out devils by beelzebub by whom do your children
cast them out therefore they shall be your judges
but if i by the finger of god cast out devils doubtless the
kingdom of god is come upon you
when a strong man armed keepeth his court those things are in
peace which he possesseth
but if a stronger than he come upon him and overcome him he will
take away all his armour wherein he trusted and will distribute his
spoils
he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through
places without water seeking rest and not finding he saith i will
return into my house whence i came out
and when he is come he findeth it swept and garnished
then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked
than himself and entering in they dwell there and the last state of
that man becomes worse than the first
and it came to pass as he spoke these things a certain woman
from the crowd lifting up her voice said to him blessed is the womb
that bore thee and the paps that gave thee suck
but he said yea rather blessed are they who hear the word of
and the multitudes running together he began to say this
generation is a wicked generation it asketh a sign and a sign shall
not be given it but the sign of jonas the prophet
for as jonas was a sign to the ninivites so shall the son of man
also be to this generation
the queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with the men of
this generation and shall condemn them because she came from the ends
of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold more than solomon
here
the men of ninive shall rise in the judgment with this generation
and shall condemn it because they did penance at the preaching of
no man lighteth a candle and putteth it in a hidden place nor
under a bushel but upon a candlestick that they that come in may see
the light
the light of thy body is thy eye if thy eye be single thy whole
body will be lightsome but if it be evil thy body also will be
darksome
take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
darkness
if then thy whole body be lightsome having no part of darkness
the whole shall be lightsome and as a bright lamp shall enlighten
thee
and as he was speaking a certain pharisee prayed him that he
would dine with him and he going in sat down to eat
and the pharisee began to say thinking within himself why he
was not washed before dinner
and the lord said to him now you pharisees make clean the
outside of the cup and of the platter but your inside is full of rapine
and iniquity
ye fools did not he that made that which is without make also
that which is within
but yet that which remaineth give alms and behold all things
are clean unto you
but woe to you pharisees because you tithe mint and rue and
every herb and pass over judgment and the charity of god now these
things you ought to have done and not to leave the other undone
woe to you pharisees because you love the uppermost seats in
the synagogues and salutations in the marketplace
woe to you because you are as sepulchres that appear not and
men that walk over are not aware
and one of the lawyers answering saith to him master in saying
these things thou reproachest us also
but he said woe to you lawyers also because you load men with
burdens which they cannot bear and you yourselves touch not the packs
with one of your fingers
commonly called the scribes
woe to you who build the monuments of the prophets and your
fathers killed them
the prophets was in itself blameworthy but only the intention of these
unhappy men who made use of this outward shew of religion and piety as
a means to carry on their wicked designs against the prince of prophets
truly you bear witness that you consent to the doings of your
fathers for they indeed killed them and you build their sepulchres
for this cause also the wisdom of god said i will send to them
prophets and apostles and some of them they will kill and persecute
that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the
foundation of the world may be required of this generation
from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias who was slain
between the altar and the temple yea i say to you it shall be required
of this generation
woe to you lawyers for you have taken away the key of knowledge
have hindered
and as he was saying these things to them the pharisees and the
lawyers began violently to urge him and to oppress his mouth about many
things
lying in wait for him and seeking to catch something from his
mouth that they might accuse him
covetousness he admonishes all to watch
and when great multitudes stood about him so that they trod one
upon another he began to say to his disciples beware ye of the leaven
of the pharisees which is hypocrisy
for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed nor
hidden that shall not be known
for whatsoever things you have spoken in darkness shall be
published in the light and that which you have spoken in the ear in the
chambers shall be preached on the housetops
and i say to you my friends be not afraid of them who kill the
body and after that have no more that they can do
but i will shew you whom you shall fear fear ye him who after he
hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say to you fear him
are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them
is forgotten before god
yea the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not
therefore you are of more value than many sparrows
and i say to you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall
the son of man also confess before the angels of god
but he that shall deny me before men shall be denied before the
angels of god
and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be
forgiven him but to him that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost it
shall not be forgiven
and when they shall bring you into the synagogues and to
magistrates and powers be not solicitous how or what you shall answer
or what you shall say
for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you must
say
and one of the multitude said to him master speak to my brother
that he divide the inheritance with me
but he said to him man who hath appointed me judge or divider
over you
and he said to them take heed and beware of all covetousness
for a mans life doth not consist in the abundance of things which he
possesseth
and he spoke a similitude to them saying the land of a certain
rich man brought forth plenty of fruits
and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i
have no room where to bestow my fruits
and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and will
build greater and into them will i gather all things that are grown to
me and my goods
and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for
many years take thy rest eat drink make good cheer
but god said to him thou fool this night do they require thy
soul of thee and whose shall those things be which thou hast provided
so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich
towards god
and he said to his disciples therefore i say to you be not
solicitous for your life what you shall eat nor for your body what
you shall put on
the life is more than the meat and the body is more than the
raiment
consider the ravens for they sow not neither do they reap
neither have they storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much
are you more valuable than they
and which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one
cubit
if then ye be not able to do so much as the least thing why are
you solicitous for the rest
consider the lilies how they grow they labour not neither do
they spin but i say to you not even solomon in all his glory was
clothed like one of these
now if god clothe in this manner the grass that is today in the
field and tomorrow is cast into the oven how much more you o ye of
little faith
and seek not what you shall eat or what you shall drink and be
not lifted up on high
for all these things do the nations of the world seek but your
but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his justice and all
these things shall be added unto you
fear not little flock for it hath pleased your father to give
you a kingdom
sell what you possess and give alms make to yourselves bags
which grow not old a treasure in heaven which faileth not where no
thief approacheth nor moth corrupteth
for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
let your loins be girt and lamps burning in your hands
and you yourselves like to men who wait for their lord when he
shall return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they
may open to him immediately
blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall
find watching amen i say to you that he will gird himself and make them
sit down to meat and passing will minister unto them
and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third
watch and find them so blessed are those servants
but this know ye that if the householder did know at what hour
the thief would come he would surely watch and would not suffer his
house to be broken open
be you then also ready for at what hour you think not the son of
man will come
and peter said to him lord dost thou speak this parable to us
or likewise to all
and the lord said who thinkest thou is the faithful and wise
steward whom his lord setteth over his family to give them their
measure of wheat in due season
blessed is that servant whom when his lord shall come he shall
find so doing
verily i say to you he will set him over all that he possesseth
but if that servant shall say in his heart my lord is long a
coming and shall begin to strike the menservants and maidservants
and to eat and to drink and be drunk
the lord of that servant will come in the day that he hopeth not
and at the hour that he knoweth not and shall separate him and shall
appoint him his portion with unbelievers
and that servant who knew the will of his lord and prepared not
himself and did not according to his will shall be beaten with many
stripes
but he that knew not and did things worthy of stripes shall be
beaten with few stripes and unto whomsoever much is given of him much
shall be required and to whom they have committed much of him they
will demand the more
i am come to cast fire on the earth and what will i but that it
be kindled
and i have a baptism wherewith i am to be baptized and how am i
straitened until it be accomplished
think ye that i am come to give peace on earth i tell you no
but separation
for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided
three against two and two against three
the father shall be divided against the son and the son against
his father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against her
mother the motherinlaw against the daughterinlaw and the daughter
inlaw against her motherinlaw
and he said also to the multitudes when you see a cloud rising
from the west presently you say a shower is coming and so it
happeneth
and when ye see the south wind blow you say there will heat
you hypocrites you know how to discern the face of the heaven
and of the earth but how is it that you do not discern this time
and why even of yourselves do you not judge that which is just
and when thou goest with thy adversary to the prince whilst thou
art in the way endeavour to be delivered from him lest perhaps he draw
thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the exacter and the
exacter cast thee into prison
i say to thee thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the
very last mite
woman the journey to jerusalem
and there were present at that very time some that told him of
the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
and he answering said to them think you that these galileans
were sinners above all the men of galilee because they suffered such
things
no i say to you but unless you shall do penance you shall all
likewise perish
or those eighteen upon whom the tower fell in siloe and slew them
think you that they also were debtors above all the men that dwelt in
no i say to you but except you do penance you shall all
likewise perish
he spoke also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted
in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit on it and found none
and he said to the dresser of the vineyard behold for these
three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and i find none cut
it down therefore why cumbereth it the ground
but he answering said to him lord let it alone this year also
until i dig about it and dung it
and if happily it bear fruit but if not then after that thou
shalt cut it down
and he was teaching in their synagogue on their sabbath
and behold there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity
eighteen years and she was bowed together neither could she look
upwards at all
whom when jesus saw he called her unto him and said to her
and he laid his hands upon her and immediately she was made
straight and glorified god
and the ruler of the synagogue being angry that jesus had healed
on the sabbath answering said to the multitude six days there are
wherein you ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not
on the sabbath day
and the lord answering him said ye hypocrites doth not every
one of you on the sabbath day loose his ox or his ass from the manger
and lead them to water
and ought not this daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound
lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day
and when he said these things all his adversaries were ashamed
and all the people rejoiced for all the things that were gloriously done
by him
he said therefore to what is the kingdom of god like and
whereunto shall i resemble it
it is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast
into his garden and it grew and became a great tree and the birds of
the air lodged in the branches thereof
and again he said whereunto shall i esteem the kingdom of god to
be like
it is like to leaven which a woman took and hid in three
measures of meal till the whole was leavened
and he went through the cities and towns teaching and making his
journey to jerusalem
and a certain man said to him lord are they few that are saved
strive to enter by the narrow gate for many i say to you shall
seek to enter and shall not be able
sufficient pains and being thoroughly in earnest shall not attain to
it
but when the master of the house shall be gone in and shall shut
the door you shall begin to stand without and knock at the door
saying lord open to us and he answering shall say to you i know you
not whence you are
then you shall begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy
presence and thou hast taught in our streets
and he shall say to you i know you not whence you are depart
from me all ye workers of iniquity
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you shall see
and you yourselves thrust out
and there shall come from the east and the west and the north and
the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god
and behold they are last that shall be first and they are first
that shall be last
the same day there came some of the pharisees saying to him
and he said to them go and tell that fox behold i cast out
devils and do cures today and tomorrow and the third day i am
consummated
nevertheless i must walk today and tomorrow and the day
following because it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem
jerusalem jerusalem that killest the prophets and stonest them
that are sent to thee how often would i have gathered thy children as
the bird doth her brood under her wings and thou wouldest not
behold your house shall be left to you desolate and i say to you
that you shall not see me till the time come when you shall say blessed
is he that cometh in the name of the lord
of renouncing all to follow christ
and it came to pass when jesus went into the house of one of the
and behold there was a certain man before him that had the
dropsy
and jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and pharisees saying
but they held their peace but he taking him healed him and sent
him away
and answering them he said which of you shall have an ass or an
ox fall into a pit and will not immediately draw him out on the sabbath
day
and they could not answer him to these things
and he spoke a parable also to them that were invited marking how
they chose the first seats at the table saying to them
when thou art invited to a wedding sit not down in the first
place lest perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him
and he that invited thee and him come and say to thee give this
man place and then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place
but when thou art invited go sit down in the lowest place that
when he who invited thee cometh he may say to thee friend go up
higher then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with
thee
because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled and he
that humbleth himself shall be exalted
and he said to him also that had invited him when thou makest a
dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy
kinsmen nor thy neighbours who are rich lest perhaps they also invite
thee again and a recompense be made to thee
but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the lame
and the blind
and thou shalt be blessed because they have not wherewith to
make thee recompense for recompense shall be made thee at the
resurrection of the just
when one of them that sat at table with him had heard these
things he said to him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the
kingdom of god
but he said to him a certain man made a great supper and invited
many
and he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that
were invited that they should come for now all things are ready
and they began all at once to make excuse the first said to him
hold me excused
and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to try
them i pray thee hold me excused
and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot
come
and the servant returning told these things to his lord then
the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out
quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the
poor and the feeble and the blind and the lame
and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast commanded
and yet there is room
and the lord said to the servant go out into the highways and
hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled
but i say unto you that none of those men that were invited shall
taste of my supper
and there went great multitudes with him and turning he said to
them
if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and
wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also
he cannot be my disciple
enemies much less our parents but the meaning of the text is that we
must be in that disposition of soul as to be willing to renounce and
part with every thing how near or dear soever it may be to us that
would keep us from following christ
and whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me cannot
be my disciple
for which of you having a mind to build a tower doth not first
sit down and reckon the charges that are necessary whether he have
wherewithal to finish it
lest after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish
it all that see it begin to mock him
saying this man began to build and was not able to finish
or what king about to go to make war against another king doth
not first sit down and think whether he be able with ten thousand to
meet him that with twenty thousand cometh against him
or else while the other is yet afar off sending an embassy he
desireth conditions of peace
so likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he
possesseth cannot be my disciple
salt is good but if the salt shall lose its savour wherewith
shall it be seasoned
it is neither profitable for the land nor for the dunghill but
shall be cast out he that hath ears to hear let him hear
now the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him
and the pharisees and the scribes murmured saying this man
receiveth sinners and eateth with them
and he spoke to them this parable saying
what man of you that hath an hundred sheep and if he shall lose
one of them doth he not leave the ninetynine in the desert and go
after that which was lost until he find it
and when he hath found it lay it upon his shoulders rejoicing
and coming home call together his friends and neighbours saying
to them rejoice with me because i have found my sheep that was lost
i say to you that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one
sinner that doth penance more than upon ninetynine just who need not
penance
or what woman having ten groats if she lose one groat doth not
light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find
it
and when she hath found it call together her friends and
neighbours saying rejoice with me because i have found the groat
which i had lost
so i say to you there shall be joy before the angels of god upon
one sinner doing penance
a concern for us below and a joy at our repentance and consequently a
knowledge of it
and he said a certain man had two sons
and the younger of them said to his father father give me the
portion of substance that falleth to me and he divided unto them his
substance
and not many days after the younger son gathering all together
went abroad into a far country and there wasted his substance living
riotously
and after he had spent all there came a mighty famine in that
country and he began to be in want
and he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country
and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine
did eat and no man gave unto him
and returning to himself he said how many hired servants in my
fathers house abound with bread and i here perish with hunger
i will arise and will go to my father and say to him father i
have sinned against heaven and before thee
i am not worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired
servants
and rising up he came to his father and when he was yet a great
way off his father saw him and was moved with compassion and running to
him fell upon his neck and kissed him
and the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and
before thee i am not now worthy to be called thy son
and the father said to his servants bring forth quickly the
first robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on
his feet
and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and
make merry
because this my son was dead and is come to life again was lost
and is found and they began to be merry
now his elder son was in the field and when he came and drew nigh
to the house he heard music and dancing
and he called one of the servants and asked what these things
meant
and he said to him thy brother is come and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe
and he was angry and would not go in his father therefore coming
out began to entreat him
and he answering said to his father behold for so many years
do i serve thee and i have never transgressed thy commandment and yet
thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends
but as soon as this thy son is come who hath devoured his
substance with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted calf
but he said to him son thou art always with me and all i have
is thine
but it was fit that we should make merry and be glad for this
thy brother was dead and is come to life again he was lost and is
found
and he said also to his disciples there was a certain rich man
who had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted
his goods
and he called him and said to him how is it that i hear this of
thee give an account of thy stewardship for now thou canst be steward
no longer
and the steward said within himself what shall i do because my
lord taketh away from me the stewardship to dig i am not able to beg i
am ashamed
i know what i will do that when i shall be removed from the
stewardship they may receive me into their houses
therefore calling together every one of his lords debtors he
said to the first how much dost thou owe my lord
but he said an hundred barrels of oil and he said to him take
thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty
then he said to another and how much dost thou owe who said an
hundred quarters of wheat he said to him take thy bill and write
eighty
and the lord commended the unjust steward forasmuch as he had
done wisely for the children of this world are wiser in their
generation than the children of light
and i say to you make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity
that when you shall fail they may receive you into everlasting
dwellings
mammon of iniquity because oftentimes ill gotten ill bestowed or an
occasion of evil and at the best are but worldly and false and not
the true riches of a christian they may receive by this we see
that the poor servants of god whom we have relieved by our alms may
hereafter by their intercession bring our souls to heaven
he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
that which is greater and he that is unjust in that which is little is
unjust also in that which is greater
if then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon who will
trust you with that which is the true
and if you have not been faithful in that which is anothers who
will give you that which is your own
no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one
and love the other or he will hold to the one and despise the other
now the pharisees who were covetous heard all these things and
they derided him
and he said to them you are they who justify yourselves before
men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is high to men is an
abomination before god
the law and the prophets were until john from that time the
kingdom of god is preached and every one useth violence towards it
and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of
the law to fall
every one that putteth away his wife and marrieth another
committeth adultery and he that marrieth her that is put away from her
husband committeth adultery
there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine
linen and feasted sumptuously every day
and there was a certain beggar named lazarus who lay at his
gate full of sores
desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich
mans table and no one did give him moreover the dogs came and licked
his sores
and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the
angels into abrahams bosom and the rich man also died and he was
buried in hell
resided till christ had opened heaven by his death
and lifting up his eyes when he was in torments he saw abraham
afar off and lazarus in his bosom
and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send
tongue for i am tormented in this flame
and abraham said to him son remember that thou didst receive
good things in thy lifetime and likewise lazarus evil things but now
he is comforted and thou art tormented
and besides all this between us and you there is fixed a great
chaos so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot nor from
thence come hither
and he said then father i beseech thee that thou wouldst send
him to my fathers house for i have five brethren
that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this
place of torments
and abraham said to him they have moses and the prophets let
them hear them
but he said no father abraham but if one went to them from the
dead they will do penance
and he said to him if they hear not moses and the prophets
neither will they believe if one rise again from the dead
lepers the manner of the coming of christ
and he said to his disciples it is impossible that scandals
should not come but woe to him through whom they come
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
and he cast into the sea than that he should scandalize one of these
little ones
take heed to yourselves if thy brother sin against thee reprove
him and if he do penance forgive him
and if he sin against thee seven times in a day and seven times
in a day be converted unto thee saying i repent forgive him
and the apostles said to the lord increase our faith
and the lord said if you had faith like to a grain of mustard
seed you might say to this mulberry tree be thou rooted up and be thou
transplanted into the sea and it would obey you
but which of you having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle
will say to him when he is come from the field immediately go sit
down to meat
and will not rather say to him make ready my supper and gird
thyself and serve me whilst i eat and drink and afterwards thou shalt
eat and drink
doth he thank that servant for doing the things which he commanded
him
i think not so you also when you shall have done all these
things that are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we
have done that which we ought to do
master and he justly claims it as our bounden duty but though we are
unprofitable to him our serving him is not unprofitable to us for he
is pleased to give by his grace a value to our good works which in
consequence of his promise entitles them to an eternal reward
and it came to pass as he was going to jerusalem he passed
through the midst of samaria and galilee
and as he entered into a certain town there met him ten men that
were lepers who stood afar off
and lifted up their voice saying jesus master have mercy on
us
whom when he saw he said go shew yourselves to the priests
and one of them when he saw that he was made clean went back
with a loud voice glorifying god
and he fell on his face before his feet giving thanks and this
was a samaritan
and jesus answering said were not ten made clean and where are
the nine
there is no one found to return and give glory to god but this
stranger
and he said to him arise go thy way for thy faith hath made
thee whole
and being asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god should
come he answering them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with
observation
neither shall they say behold here or behold there for lo the
kingdom of god is within you
and he said to his disciples the days will come when you shall
desire to see one day of the son of man and you shall not see it
and they will say to you see here and see there go ye not
after nor follow them
for as the lightning that lighteneth from under heaven shineth
unto the parts that are under heaven so shall the son of man be in his
day
but first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this
generation
and as it came to pass in the days of noe so shall it be also in
the days of the son of man
they did eat and drink they married wives and were given in
marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood came
and destroyed them all
likewise as it came to pass in the days of lot they did eat and
drink they bought and sold they planted and built
and in the day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and
brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all
even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man shall be
revealed
in that hour he that shall be on the housetop and his goods in
the house let him not go down to take them away and he that shall be
in the field in like manner let him not return back
remember lots wife
whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and
whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it
i say to you in that night there shall be two men in one bed
two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and
the other shall be left two men shall be in the field the one shall be
taken and the other shall be left
they answering say to him where lord
who said to them wheresoever the body shall be thither will the
eagles also be gathered together
riches the blind man is restored to sight
and he spoke also a parable to them that we ought always to pray
and not to faint
saying there was a judge in a certain city who feared not god
nor regarded man
and there was a certain widow in that city and she came to him
saying avenge me of my adversary
and he would not for a long time but afterwards he said within
himself although i fear not god nor regard man
yet because this widow is troublesome to me i will avenge her
lest continually coming she weary me
and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith
and will not god revenge his elect who cry to him day and night
i say to you that he will quickly revenge them but yet the son of
man when he cometh shall he find think you faith on earth
and to some who trusted in themselves as just and despised others
he spoke also this parable
two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and
the other a publican
the pharisee standing prayed thus with himself o god i give
thee thanks that i am not as the rest of men extortioners unjust
adulterers as also is this publican
i fast twice in a week i give tithes of all that i possess
and the publican standing afar off would not so much as lift up
his eyes towards heaven but struck his breast saying o god be
merciful to me a sinner
i say to you this man went down into his house justified rather
than the other because every one that exalteth himself shall be
humbled and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
and they brought unto him also infants that he might touch them
but jesus calling them together said suffer children to come
to me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god
amen i say to you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i
do to possess everlasting life
and jesus said to him why dost thou call me good none is good
but god alone
thou knowest the commandments thou shalt not kill thou shalt
not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false
witness honour thy father and mother
who said all these things have i kept from my youth
which when jesus had heard he said to him yet one thing is
wanting to thee sell all whatever thou hast and give to the poor and
thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me
he having heard these things became sorrowful for he was very
rich
and jesus seeing him become sorrowful said how hardly shall
they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
for it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
and they that heard it said who then can be saved
he said to them the things that are impossible with men are
possible with god
then peter said behold we have left all things and have
followed thee
who said to them amen i say to you there is no man that hath
left home or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of
who shall not receive much more in this present time and in the
world to come life everlasting
then jesus took unto him the twelve and said to them behold we
go up to jerusalem and all things shall be accomplished which were
written by the prophets concerning the son of man
for he shall be delivered to the gentiles and shall be mocked and
scourged and spit upon
and after they have scourged him they will put him to death and
the third day he shall rise again
and they understood none of these things and this word was hid
from them and they understood not the things that were said
now it came to pass when he drew nigh to jericho that a certain
blind man sat by the way side begging
and when he heard the multitude passing by he asked what this
meant
and they told him that jesus of nazareth was passing by
and he cried out saying jesus son of david have mercy on me
and they that went before rebuked him that he should hold his
peace but he cried out much more son of david have mercy on me
and jesus standing commanded him to be brought unto him and
when he was come near he asked him
saying what wilt thou that i do to thee but he said lord that
and jesus said to him receive thy sight thy faith hath made
thee whole
and immediately he saw and followed him glorifying god and all
the people when they saw it gave praise to god
an ass and weeps over jerusalem
and entering he walked through jericho
and behold there was a man named zacheus who was the chief of
the publicans and he was rich
and he sought to see jesus who he was and he could not for the
crowd because he was low of stature
and running before he climbed up into a sycamore tree that he
might see him for he was to pass that way
and when jesus was come to the place looking up he saw him and
said to him zacheus make haste and come down for this day i must
abide in thy house
and he made haste and came down and received him with joy
and when all saw it they murmured saying that he was gone to be
a guest with a man that was a sinner
but zacheus standing said to the lord behold lord the half of
my goods i give to the poor and if i have wronged any man of any thing
jesus said to him this day is salvation come to this house
because he also is a son of abraham
for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
lost
as they were hearing these things he added and spoke a parable
because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the
kingdom of god should immediately be manifested
he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to
receive for himself a kingdom and to return
and calling his ten servants he gave them ten pounds and said to
them trade till i come
pound is in latin mina in value of our coin three pounds two
shillings and sixpence
but his citizens hated him and they sent an embassage after him
saying we will not have this man to reign over us
and it came to pass that he returned having received the
kingdom and he commanded his servants to be called to whom he had
given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by
trading
and the first came saying lord thy pound hath gained ten
pounds
and he said to him well done thou good servant because thou
hast been faithful in a little thou shalt have power over ten cities
and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five
pounds
and he said to him be thou also over five cities
and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound which i
have kept laid up in a napkin
for i feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest
up what thou didst not lay down and thou reapest that which thou didst
not sow
he saith to him out of thy own mouth i judge thee thou wicked
servant thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up what i laid
not down and reaping that which i did not sow
and why then didst thou not give my money into the bank that at
my coming i might have exacted it with usury
and he said to them that stood by take the pound away from him
and give it to him that hath ten pounds
and they said to him lord he hath ten pounds
but i say to you that to every one that hath shall be given and
he shall abound and from him that hath not even that which he hath
shall be taken from him
but as for those my enemies who would not have me reign over
them bring them hither and kill them before me
and having said these things he went before going up to
and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and
saying go into the town which is over against you at your
entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied on which no
man ever hath sitten loose him and bring him hither
and if any man shall ask you why do you loose him you shall say
thus unto him because the lord hath need of his service
and they that were sent went their way and found the colt
standing as he said unto them
and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said to
them why loose you the colt
but they said because the lord hath need of him
and they brought him to jesus and casting their garments on the
colt they set jesus thereon
and as he went they spread their clothes underneath in the way
and when he was now coming near the descent of mount olivet the
whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise god with a
loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen
saying blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the lord
and some of the pharisees from amongst the multitude said to
him master rebuke thy disciples
to whom he said i say to you that if these shall hold their
peace the stones will cry out
and when he drew near seeing the city he wept over it saying
if thou also hadst known and that in this thy day the things
that are to thy peace but now they are hidden from thy eyes
for the days shall come upon thee and thy enemies shall cast a
trench about thee and compass thee round and straiten thee on every
side
and beat thee flat to the ground and thy children who are in
thee and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone because
thou hast not known the time of thy visitation
and entering into the temple he began to cast out them that sold
therein and them that bought
saying to them it is written my house is the house of prayer
and he was teaching daily in the temple and the chief priests
and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him
and they found not what to do to him for all the people were
very attentive to hear him
resurrection of the dead
and it came to pass that on one of the days as he was teaching
the people in the temple and preaching the gospel the chief priests and
the scribes with the ancients met together
and spoke to him saying tell us by what authority dost thou
these things or who is he that hath given thee this authority
and jesus answering said to them i will also ask you one thing
the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men
but they thought within themselves saying if we shall say from
heaven he will say why then did you not believe in him
but if we say of men the whole people will stone us for they
are persuaded that john was a prophet
and they answered that they knew not whence it was
and jesus said to them neither do i tell you by what authority i
do these things
and he began to speak to the people this parable a certain man
planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen and he was abroad for a
long time
and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they
should give him of the fruit of the vineyard who beating him sent him
away empty
and again he sent another servant but they beat him also and
treating him reproachfully sent him away empty
and again he sent the third and they wounded him also and cast
him out
then the lord of the vineyard said what shall i do i will send
my beloved son it may be when they see him they will reverence him
whom when the husbandmen saw they thought within themselves
saying this is the heir let us kill him that the inheritance may be
ours
so casting him out of the vineyard they killed him what
therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them
he will come and will destroy these husbandmen and will give the
vineyard to others which they hearing said to him god forbid
but he looking on them said what is this then that is written
the corner
whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be bruised and upon
whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
and the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him
the same hour but they feared the people for they knew that he spoke
this parable to them
and being upon the watch they sent spies who should feign
themselves just that they might take hold of him in his words that
they might deliver him up to the authority and power of the governor
and they asked him saying master we know that thou speakest
and teachest rightly and thou dost not respect any person but teachest
the way of god in truth
is it lawful for us to give tribute to caesar or no
but he considering their guile said to them why tempt you me
shew me a penny whose image and inscription hath it they
answering said to him caesars
and he said to them render therefore to caesar the things that
are caesars and to god the things that are gods
and they could not reprehend his word before the people and
wondering at his answer they held their peace
and there came to him some of the sadducees who deny that there
is any resurrection and they asked him
saying master moses wrote unto us if any mans brother die
having a wife and he leave no children that his brother should take
her to wife and raise up seed unto his brother
there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife
and died without children
and the next took her to wife and he also died childless
and the third took her and in like manner all the seven and
they left no children and died
last of all the woman died also
in the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be
and jesus said to them the children of this world marry and are
given in marriage
but they that shall be accounted worthy of that world and of the
resurrection from the dead shall neither be married nor take wives
neither can they die any more for they are equal to the angels
and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection
now that the dead rise again moses also shewed at the bush when
he called the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god
of jacob
for he is not the god of the dead but of the living for all
live to him
and some of the scribes answering said to him master thou hast
said well
and after that they durst not ask him any more questions
but he said to them how say they that christ is the son of
and david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said to
my lord sit thou on my right hand
till i make thy enemies thy footstool
david then calleth him lord and how is he his son
and in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples
beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes and love
salutations in the market place and the first chairs in the synagogues
and the chief rooms at feasts
who devour the houses of widows feigning long prayer these
shall receive greater damnation
and looking on he saw the rich men cast their gifts into the
treasury
and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in two brass mites
and he said verily i say to you that this poor widow hath cast
in more than they all
for all these have of their abundance cast into the offerings of
and some saying of the temple that it was adorned with goodly
stones and gifts he said
these things which you see the days will come in which there
shall not be left a stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown down
and they asked him saying master when shall these things be
who said take heed you be not seduced for many will come in my
name saying i am he and the time is at hand go ye not therefore after
them
and when you shall hear of wars and seditions be not terrified
then he said to them nation shall rise against nation and
kingdom against kingdom
and there shall be great earthquakes in divers places and
pestilences and famines and terrors from heaven and there shall be
great signs
but before all these things they will lay their hands on you and
persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons
dragging you before kings and governors for my names sake
and it shall happen unto you for a testimony
lay it up therefore in your hearts not to meditate before how
you shall answer
for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your
adversaries shall not be able to resist and gainsay
and you shall be betrayed by your parents and brethren and
kinsmen and friends and some of you they will put to death
and you shall be hated by all men for my names sake
but a hair of your head shall not perish
in your patience you shall possess your souls
and when you shall see jerusalem compassed about with an army
then know that the desolation thereof is at hand
then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains and those
who are in the midst thereof depart out and those who are in the
countries not enter into it
for these are the days of vengeance that all things may be
fulfilled that are written
but woe to them that are with child and give suck in those days
for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this
people
and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led
away captives into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down by
the gentiles till the times of the nations be fulfilled
and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the
stars and upon the earth distress of nations by reason of the
confusion of the roaring of the sea and of the waves
men withering away for fear and expectation of what shall come
upon the whole world for the powers of heaven shall be moved
and then they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with
great power and majesty
but when these things begin to come to pass look up and lift up
your heads because your redemption is at hand
and he spoke to them a similitude see the fig tree and all the
trees
when they now shoot forth their fruit you know that summer is
nigh
so you also when you shall see these things come to pass know
that the kingdom of god is at hand
amen i say to you this generation shall not pass away till all
things be fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass
away
and take heed to yourselves lest perhaps your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life
and that day come upon you suddenly
for as a snare shall it come upon all that sit upon the face of
the whole earth
watch ye therefore praying at all times that you may be
accounted worthy to escape all these things that are to come and to
stand before the son of man
and in the daytime he was teaching in the temple but at night
going out he abode in the mount that is called olivet
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the
temple to hear him
the passion
now the feast of unleavened bread which is called the pasch was
at hand
and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put
and satan entered into judas who was surnamed iscariot one of
the twelve
and he went and discoursed with the chief priests and the
magistrates how he might betray him to them
and they were glad and covenanted to give him money
and he promised and he sought opportunity to betray him in the
absence of the multitude
and the day of the unleavened bread came on which it was
necessary that the pasch should be killed
and he sent peter and john saying go and prepare for us the
pasch that we may eat
but they said where wilt thou that we prepare
and he said to them behold as you go into the city there shall
meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water follow him into the house
where he entereth in
and you shall say to the goodman of the house the master saith
to thee where is the guest chamber where i may eat the pasch with my
disciples
and he will shew you a large dining room furnished and there
prepare
and they going found as he had said to them and made ready the
pasch
and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles
with him
and he said to them with desire i have desired to eat this pasch
with you before i suffer
for i say to you that from this time i will not eat it till it
be fulfilled in the kingdom of god
and having taken the chalice he gave thanks and said take and
divide it among you
for i say to you that i will not drink of the fruit of the vine
till the kingdom of god come
and taking bread he gave thanks and brake and gave to them
saying this is my body which is given for you do this for a
commemoration of me
be continued in the church to the end of the world to shew forth the
death of christ until he cometh but this commemoration or
remembrance is by no means inconsistent with the real presence of his
body and blood under these sacramental veils which represent his
death on the contrary it is the manner that he himself hath commanded
of commemorating and celebrating his death by offering in sacrifice
and receiving in the sacrament that body and blood by which we were
redeemed
in like manner the chalice also after he had supped saying
for you
but yet behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on
the table
and the son of man indeed goeth according to that which is
determined but yet woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed
and they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was
that should do this thing
and there was also a strife amongst them which of them should
seem to be the greater
and he said to them the kings of the gentiles lord it over them
and they that have power over them are called beneficent
but you not so but he that is the greater among you let him
become as the younger and he that is the leader as he that serveth
for which is greater he that sitteth at table or he that
serveth is not he that sitteth at table but i am in the midst of you
as he that serveth
and you are they who have continued with me in my temptations
and i dispose to you as my father hath disposed to me a
kingdom
that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and may
sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to
have you that he may sift you as wheat
but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and thou
being once converted confirm thy brethren
who said to him lord i am ready to go with thee both into
prison and to death
and he said i say to thee peter the cock shall not crow this
day till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me and he said to them
when i sent you without purse and scrip and shoes did you want
anything
but they said nothing then said he unto them but now he that
hath a purse let him take it and likewise a scrip and he that hath
not let him sell his coat and buy a sword
for i say to you that this that is written must yet be fulfilled
in me and with the wicked was he reckoned for the things concerning me
have an end
but they said lord behold here are two swords and he said to
them it is enough
and going out he went according to his custom to the mount of
and when he was come to the place he said to them pray lest ye
enter into temptation
and he was withdrawn away from them a stones cast and kneeling
down he prayed
saying father if thou wilt remove this chalice from me but
yet not my will but thine be done
and there appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening
him and being in an agony he prayed the longer
and his sweat became as drops of blood trickling down upon the
ground
and when he rose up from prayer and was come to the disciples he
found them sleeping for sorrow
and he said to them why sleep you arise pray lest you enter
into temptation
as he was yet speaking behold a multitude and he that was
called judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near to
and jesus said to him judas dost thou betray the son of man
with a kiss
and they that were about him seeing what would follow said to
him lord shall we strike with the sword
and one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off
his right ear
but jesus answering said suffer ye thus far and when he had
touched his ear he healed him
and jesus said to the chief priests and magistrates of the temple
and the ancients that were come unto him are ye come out as it were
against a thief with swords and clubs
when i was daily with you in the temple you did not stretch
forth your hands against me but this is your hour and the power of
darkness
and apprehending him they led him to the high priests house
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and
were sitting about it peter was in the midst of them
whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light
and had earnestly beheld him she said this man also was with him
but he denied him saying woman i know him not
and after a little while another seeing him said thou also art
one of them but peter said o man i am not
the porteress that let him in and afterwards seeing him at the fire
first put the question to him and then positively affirmed that he was
with christ another maid accused him to the standers by and gave
occasion to the man here mentioned to renew the charge against him
which caused the second denial others of the company took notice of
his being a galilean and were seconded by the kinsman of malchus who
affirmed he had seen him in the garden and this drew on the third
denial
and after the space as it were of one hour another certain man
affirmed saying of a truth this man was also with him for he is also
a galilean
and peter said man i know not what thou sayest and
immediately as he was yet speaking the cock crew
and the lord turning looked on peter and peter remembered the
word of the lord as he had said before the cock crow thou shalt deny
thrice
and peter going out wept bitterly
and the men that held him mocked him and struck him
and they blindfolded him and smote his face and they asked him
saying prophesy who is it that struck thee
and blaspheming many other things they said against him
and as soon as it was day the ancients of the people and the
chief priests and scribes came together and they brought him into their
council saying if thou be the christ tell us
and he saith to them if i shall tell you you will not believe
me
and if i shall also ask you you will not answer me nor let me
go
but hereafter the son of man shall be sitting on the right hand
of the power of god
then said they all art thou then the son of god who said you
say that i am
and they said what need we any further testimony for we
ourselves have heard it from his own mouth
and the whole multitude of them rising up led him to pilate
and they began to accuse him saying we have found this man
perverting our nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar and
saying that he is christ the king
and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews but
he answering said thou sayest it
and pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes i find
no cause in this man
but they were more earnest saying he stirreth up the people
teaching throughout all judea beginning from galilee to this place
but pilate hearing galilee asked if the man were of galilee
and when he understood that he was of herods jurisdiction he
sent him away to herod who was also himself at jerusalem in those days
and herod seeing jesus was very glad for he was desirous of a
long time to see him because he had heard many things of him and he
hoped to see some sign wrought by him
and he questioned him in many words but he answered him nothing
and the chief priests and the scribes stood by earnestly
accusing him
and herod with his army set him at nought and mocked him putting
on him a white garment and sent him back to pilate
and herod and pilate were made friends that same day for before
they were enemies one to another
and pilate calling together the chief priests and the
magistrates and the people
said to them you have presented unto me this man as one that
perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you
find no cause in this man in those things wherein you accuse him
no nor herod neither for i sent you to him and behold
nothing worthy of death is done to him
i will chastise him therefore and release him
now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast
day
but the whole multitude together cried out saying away with
this man and release unto us barabbas
who for a certain sedition made in the city and for a murder
was cast into prison
and pilate again spoke to them desiring to release jesus
but they cried again saying crucify him crucify him
and he said to them the third time why what evil hath this man
done i find no cause of death in him i will chastise him therefore and
let him go
but they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might
be crucified and their voices prevailed
and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required
and he released unto them him who for murder and sedition had
been cast into prison whom they had desired but jesus he delivered up
to their will
and as they led him away they laid hold of one simon of cyrene
coming from the country and they laid the cross on him to carry after
and there followed him a great multitude of people and of women
who bewailed and lamented him
but jesus turning to them said daughters of jerusalem weep not
over me but weep for yourselves and for your children
for behold the days shall come wherein they will say blessed
are the barren and the wombs that have not borne and the paps that have
not given suck
then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall upon us and
to the hills cover us
for if in the green wood they do these things what shall be done
in the dry
and there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put
to death
and when they were come to the place which is called calvary
they crucified him there and the robbers one on the right hand and
the other on the left
and jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they
do but they dividing his garments cast lots
and the people stood beholding and the rulers with them derided
him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the
elect of god
and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him
vinegar
and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself
and there was also a superscription written over him in letters
of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews
and one of those robbers who were hanged blasphemed him saying
but the other answering rebuked him saying neither dost thou
fear god seeing thou art under the same condemnation
and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds
and he said to jesus lord remember me when thou shalt come into
thy kingdom
and jesus said to him amen i say to thee this day thou shalt be
with me in paradise
everlasting christ was pleased by a special privilege to reward the
faith and confession of the penitent thief with a full discharge of all
his sins both as to the guilt and punishment and to introduce him
immediately after death into the happy society of the saints whose
limbo that is the place of their confinement was now made a paradise
by our lords going thither
and it was almost the sixth hour and there was darkness over all
the earth until the ninth hour
and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in
the midst
and jesus crying with a loud voice said father into thy hands
now the centurion seeing what was done glorified god saying
and all the multitude of them that were come together to that
sight and saw the things that were done returned striking their
breasts
and all his acquaintance and the women that had followed him from
and behold there was a man named joseph who was a counsellor a
good and a just man
the same had not consented to their counsel and doings of
this man went to pilate and begged the body of jesus
and taking him down he wrapped him in fine linen and laid him in
a sepulchre that was hewed in stone wherein never yet any man had been
laid
and it was the day of the parasceve and the sabbath drew on
and the women that were come with him from galilee following
after saw the sepulchre and how his body was laid
and returning they prepared spices and ointments and on the
sabbath day they rested according to the commandment
and on the first day of the week very early in the morning they
came to the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared
and they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre
and going in they found not the body of the lord jesus
and it came to pass as they were astonished in their mind at
this behold two men stood by them in shining apparel
and as they were afraid and bowed down their countenance towards
the ground they said unto them why seek you the living with the dead
he is not here but is risen remember how he spoke unto you when
he was yet in galilee
saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
men and be crucified and the third day rise again
and they remembered his words
and going back from the sepulchre they told all these things to
the eleven and to all the rest
and it was mary magdalen and joanna and mary of james and the
other women that were with them who told these things to the apostles
and these words seemed to them as idle tales and they did not
believe them
but peter rising up ran to the sepulchre and stooping down he
saw the linen cloths laid by themselves and went away wondering in
himself at that which was come to pass
and behold two of them went the same day to a town which was
sixty furlongs from jerusalem named emmaus
and they talked together of all these things which had happened
and it came to pass that while they talked and reasoned with
themselves jesus himself also drawing near went with them
but their eyes were held that they should not know him
and he said to them what are these discourses that you hold one
with another as you walk and are sad
and the one of them whose name was cleophas answering said to
him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the
things that have been done there in these days
to whom he said what things and they said concerning jesus of
the people
and how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be
condemned to death and crucified him
but we hoped that it was he that should have redeemed israel and
now besides all this today is the third day since these things were
done
yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us who
before it was light were at the sepulchre
and not finding his body came saying that they had all seen a
vision of angels who say that he is alive
and some of our people went to the sepulchre and found it so as
the women had said but him they found not
then he said to them o foolish and slow of heart to believe in
all things which the prophets have spoken
ought not christ to have suffered these things and so to enter
into his glory
and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded to them
in all the scriptures the things that were concerning him
and they drew nigh to the town whither they were going and he
made as though he would go farther
but they constrained him saying stay with us because it is
towards evening and the day is now far spent and he went in with them
and it came to pass whilst he was at table with them he took
bread and blessed and brake and gave to them
and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished
out of their sight
and they said one to the other was not our heart burning within
us whilst he spoke in the way and opened to us the scriptures
and rising up the same hour they went back to jerusalem and
they found the eleven gathered together and those that were with them
saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon
and they told what things were done in the way and how they knew
him in the breaking of bread
now whilst they were speaking these things jesus stood in the
midst of them and saith to them peace be to you it is i fear not
but they being troubled and frightened supposed that they saw a
spirit
and he said to them why are you troubled and why do thoughts
arise in your hearts
see my hands and feet that it is i myself handle and see for
a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me to have
and when he had said this he shewed them his hands and feet
but while they yet believed not and wondered for joy he said
and they offered him a piece of a broiled fish and a honeycomb
and when he had eaten before them taking the remains he gave to
them
and he said to them these are the words which i spoke to you
while i was yet with you that all things must needs be fulfilled which
are written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms
concerning me
then he opened their understanding that they might understand
the scriptures
and he said to them thus it is written and thus it behoved
and that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his
name unto all nations beginning at jerusalem
and you are witnesses of these things
and i send the promise of my father upon you but stay you in the
city till you be endued with power from on high
promised that his father and he would send john and
and he led them out as far as bethania and lifting up his hands
he blessed them
and it came to pass whilst he blessed them he departed from
them and was carried up to heaven
and they adoring went back into jerusalem with great joy
and they were always in the temple praising and blessing god
brother to james the greater he was called the beloved disciple of
other evangelists about sixtythree years after our lords ascension
written in greek and by the greeks he is titled the divine st jerome
relates that when he was earnestly requested by the brethren to write
the gospel he answered he would do it if by ordering a common fast
they would all put up their prayers together to the almighty god which
being ended replenished with the clearest and fullest revelation coming
from heaven he burst forth into that preface in the beginning was the
