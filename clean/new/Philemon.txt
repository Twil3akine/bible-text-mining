fugitive servant whom he had converted in prison
paul a prisoner of christ jesus and timothy a brother to
and to appia our dearest sister and to archippus our fellow
soldier and to the church which is in thy house
grace to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus
i give thanks to my god always making a remembrance of thee in my
prayers
hearing of thy charity and faith which thou hast in the lord jesus
and towards all the saints
that the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the
acknowledgment of every good work that is in you in christ jesus
for i have had great joy and consolation in thy charity because
the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee brother
wherefore though i have much confidence in christ jesus to command
thee that which is to the purpose
for charity sake i rather beseech whereas thou art such a one as
i beseech thee for my son whom i have begotten in my bands
who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee but now is
profitable both to me and thee
whom i have sent back to thee and do thou receive him as my own
bowels
whom i would have retained with me that in thy stead he might
have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel
but without thy counsel i would do nothing that thy good deed
might not be as it were of necessity but voluntary
for perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee that thou
mightest receive him again for ever
not now as a servant but instead of a servant a most dear
brother especially to me but how much more to thee both in the flesh
and in the lord
if therefore thou count me a partner receive him as myself
and if he hath wronged thee in any thing or is in thy debt put
that to my account
i paul have written it with my own hand i will repay it not to
say to thee that thou owest me thy own self also
yea brother may i enjoy thee in the lord refresh my bowels in
the lord
trusting in thy obedience i have written to thee knowing that
thou wilt also do more than i say
but withal prepare me also a lodging for i hope that through your
prayers i shall be given unto you
there salute thee epaphras my fellow prisoner in christ jesus
mark aristarchus demas and luke my fellow labourers
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen
part of whom being jews before their conversion they were called
faith of christ clearly shewing them the preeminence of christs
priesthood above the levitical and also the excellence of the new law
above the old he commends faith by the example of the ancient fathers
and exhorts them to patience and perseverance and to remain in fraternal
charity it appears from chap that this epistle was written in
