the former treatise i made o theophilus of all things which jesus
began to do and to teach
until the day on which giving commandments by the holy ghost to
the apostles whom he had chosen he was taken up
to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
proofs for forty days appearing to them and speaking of the kingdom of
and eating together with them he commanded them that they should
not depart from jerusalem but should wait for the promise of the
for john indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized with
the holy ghost not many days hence
they therefore who were come together asked him saying lord
wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom of israel
but he said to them it is not for you to know the time or moments
which the father hath put in his own power
but you shall receive the power of the holy ghost coming upon you
and you shall be witnesses unto me in jerusalem and in all judea and
and when he had said these things while they looked on he was
raised up and a cloud received him out of their sight
and while they were beholding him going up to heaven behold two
men stood by them in white garments
who also said ye men of galilee why stand you looking up to
heaven this jesus who is taken up from you into heaven shall so come
as you have seen him going into heaven
then they returned to jerusalem from the mount that is called
and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where
abode peter and john james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew
and matthew james of alpheus and simon zelotes and jude the brother of
all these were persevering with one mind in prayer with the women
and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren
in those days peter rising up in the midst of the brethren said
now the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty
men brethren the scripture must needs be fulfilled which the
the leader of them that apprehended jesus
who was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry
and he indeed hath possessed a field of the reward of iniquity
and being hanged burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed
out
and it became known to all the inhabitants of jerusalem so that
the same field was called in their tongue haceldama that is to say
for it is written in the book of psalms let their habitation
become desolate and let there be none to dwell therein and his
bishopric let another take
wherefore of these men who have companied with us all the time
that the lord jesus came in and went out among us
beginning from the baptism of john until the day wherein he was
taken up from us one of these must be made a witness with us of his
resurrection
and they appointed two joseph called barsabas who was surnamed
and praying they said thou lord who knowest the heart of all
men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen
to take the place of this ministry and apostleship from which
and they gave them lot and the lot fell upon matthias and he was
numbered with the eleven apostles
piety of the first converts
and when the days of the pentecost were accomplished they were all
together in one place
and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a mighty wind
coming and it filled the whole house where they were sitting
and there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire and
it sat upon every one of them
and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they began to
speak with divers tongues according as the holy ghost gave them to
speak
now there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of
every nation under heaven
and when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and
were confounded in mind because that every man heard them speak in his
own tongue
and they were all amazed and wondered saying behold are not all
these that speak galilean
and how have we heard every man our own tongue wherein we were
born
parthians and medes and elamites and inhabitants of mesopotamia
phrygia and pamphylia egypt and the parts of libya about cyrene
and strangers of rome
jews also and proselytes cretes and arabians we have heard
them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of god
and they were all astonished and wondered saying one to another
but others mocking said these men are full of new wine
but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and
spoke to them ye men of judea and all you that dwell in jerusalem be
this known to you and with your ears receive my words
for these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the
third hour of the day
but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet joel
and it shall come to pass in the last days saith the lord i
will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your
old men shall dream dreams
and upon my servants indeed and upon my handmaids will i pour out
in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy
and i will shew wonders in the heaven above and signs on the
earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke
the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood
before the great and manifest day of the lord to come
and it shalt come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name
of the lord shall be saved
ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man
approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god
did by him in the midst of you as you also know
this same being delivered up by the determinate counsel and
foreknowledge of god you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and
slain
delivered up himself for the love of us and for the sake of our
salvation and so christs being delivered up was holy and was gods
own determination but they who betrayed and crucified him did
wickedly following therein their own malice and the instigation of the
devil not the will and determination of god who was by no means the
author of their wickedness though he permitted it because he could
and did draw out of it so great a good viz the salvation of man
whom god hath raised up having loosed the sorrows of hell as it
was impossible that he should be holden by it
death and all the power of hell
for david saith concerning him i foresaw the lord before my face
because he is at my right hand that i may not be moved
for this my heart hath been glad and my tongue hath rejoiced
moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell nor suffer thy holy
thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me
full of joy with thy countenance
ye men brethren let me freely speak to you of the patriarch
present say
whereas therefore he was a prophet and knew that god hath sworn to
him with an oath that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his
throne
foreseeing this he spoke of the resurrection of christ for
neither was he left in hell neither did his flesh see corruption
this jesus hath god raised again whereof all we are witnesses
being exalted therefore by the right hand of god and having
received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath poured
forth this which you see and hear
for david ascended not into heaven but he himself said the lord
said to my lord sit thou on my right hand
until i make thy enemies thy footstool
therefore let all the house of israel know most certainly that god
hath made both lord and christ this same jesus whom you have
crucified
now when they had heard these things they had compunction in
their heart and said to peter and to the rest of the apostles what
shall we do men and brethren
but peter said to them do penance and be baptized every one of
you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you
shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
for the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are
far off whomsoever the lord our god shall call
and with very many other words did he testify and exhort them
saying save yourselves from this perverse generation
they therefore that received his word were baptized and there
were added in that day about three thousand souls
and they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles and in
the communication of the breaking of bread and in prayers
and fear came upon every soul many wonders also and signs were
done by the apostles in jerusalem and there was great fervor in all
and all they that believed were together and had all things
common
their possessions and goods they sold and divided them to all
according as every one had need
and continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking
bread from house to house they took their meat with gladness and
simplicity of heart
praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord
increased daily together such as should be saved
now peter and john went up into the temple at the ninth hour of
prayer
and a certain man who was lame from his mothers womb was carried
whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple which is called
he when he had seen peter and john about to go into the temple
asked to receive an alms
but peter with john fastening his eyes upon him said look upon
us
but he looked earnestly upon them hoping that he should receive
something of them
but peter said silver and gold i have none but what i have i
give thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth arise and walk
and taking him by the right hand he lifted him up and forthwith
his feet and soles received strength
and he leaping up stood and walked and went in with them into the
temple walking and leaping and praising god
and all the people saw him walking and praising god
and they knew him that it was he who sat begging alms at the
amazement at that which had happened to him
and as he held peter and john all the people ran to them to the
porch which is called solomons greatly wondering
but peter seeing made answer to the people ye men of israel why
wonder you at this or why look you upon us as if by our strength or
power we had made this man to walk
the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob the
delivered up and denied before the face of pilate when he judged he
should be released
but you denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer
to be granted unto you
but the author of life you killed whom god hath raised from the
dead of which we are witnesses
and in the faith of his name this man whom you have seen and
known hath his name strengthened and the faith which is by him hath
given this perfect soundness in the sight of you all
and now brethren i know that you did it through ignorance as
did also your rulers
but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all
the prophets that his christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled
be penitent therefore and be converted that your sins may be
blotted out
that when the times of refreshment shall come from the presence of
the lord and he shall send him who hath been preached unto you jesus
whom heaven indeed must receive until the times of the
restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of his
holy prophets from the beginning of the world
for moses said a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto
you of your brethren like unto me him you shall hear according to all
things whatsoever he shall speak to you
and it shall be that every soul which will not hear that prophet
shall be destroyed from among the people
and all the prophets from samuel and afterwards who have spoken
have told of these days
you are the children of the prophets and of the testament which
the kindreds of the earth be blessed
to you first god raising up his son hath sent him to bless you
that every one may convert himself from his wickedness
increased
and as they were speaking to the people the priests and the officer
of the temple and the sadducees came upon them
being grieved that they taught the people and preached in jesus the
resurrection from the dead
and they laid hands upon them and put them in hold till the next
day for it was now evening
but many of them who had heard the word believed and the number of
the men was made five thousand
and it came to pass on the morrow that their princes and ancients
and scribes were gathered together in jerusalem
and annas the high priest and caiphas and john and alexander and
as many as were of the kindred of the high priest
and setting them in the midst they asked by what power or by what
name have you done this
then peter filled with the holy ghost said to them ye princes of
the people and ancients hear
if we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the
infirm man by what means he hath been made whole
be it known to you all and to all the people of israel that by
the name of our lord jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified whom
before you whole
this is the stone which was rejected by you the builders which is
become the head of the corner
neither is there salvation in any other for there is no other
name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved
now seeing the constancy of peter and of john understanding that
they were illiterate and ignorant men they wondered and they knew them
that they had been with jesus
seeing the man also who had been healed standing with them they
could say nothing against it
but they commanded them to go aside out of the council and they
conferred among themselves
saying what shall we do to these men for indeed a miracle hath
been done by them known to all the inhabitants of jerusalem it is
manifest and we cannot deny it
but that it may be no farther spread among the people let us
threaten them that they speak no more in this name to any man
and calling them they charged them not to speak at all nor teach
in the name of jesus
but peter and john answering said to them if it be just in the
sight of god to hear you rather than god judge ye
for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard
but they threatening sent them away not finding how they might
punish them because of the people for all men glorified what had been
done in that which had come to pass
for the man was above forty years old in whom that miraculous
cure had been wrought
and being let go they came to their own company and related all
that the chief priests and ancients had said to them
who having heard it with one accord lifted up their voice to god
and said lord thou art he that didst make heaven and earth the sea
and all things that are in them
who by the holy ghost by the mouth of our father david thy
servant hast said why did the gentiles rage and the people meditate
vain things
the kings of the earth stood up and the princes assembled
together against the lord and his christ
for of a truth there assembled together in this city against thy
holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed herod and pontius pilate
with the gentiles and the people of israel
to do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done
and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy
servants that with all confidence they may speak thy word
by stretching forth thy hand to cures and signs and wonders to be
done by the name of thy holy son jesus
and when they had prayed the place was moved wherein they were
assembled and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spoke
the word of god with confidence
and the multitude of believers had but one heart and one soul
his own but all things were common unto them
and with great power did the apostles give testimony of the
resurrection of jesus christ our lord and great grace was in them all
for neither was there any one needy among them for as many as
were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the price of the
things they sold
and laid it down before the feet of the apostles and distribution
was made to every one according as he had need
and joseph who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is
by interpretation the son of consolation a levite a cyprian born
having land sold it and brought the price and laid it at the feet
of the apostles
prison
but a certain man named ananias with saphira his wife sold a
piece of land
and by fraud kept back part of the price of the land his wife
being privy thereunto and bringing a certain part of it laid it at the
feet of the apostles
but peter said ananias why hath satan tempted thy heart that
thou shouldst lie to the holy ghost and by fraud keep part of the price
of the land
whilst it remained did it not remain to thee and after it was
sold was it not in thy power why hast thou conceived this thing in thy
heart thou hast not lied to men but to god
and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost
and the young men rising up removed him and carrying him out
buried him
and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not
knowing what had happened came in
and peter said to her tell me woman whether you sold the land
for so much and she said yea for so much
and peter said unto her why have you agreed together to tempt the
spirit of the lord behold the feet of them who have buried thy husband
are at the door and they shall carry thee out
immediately she fell down before his feet and gave up the ghost
buried her by her husband
and there came great fear upon the whole church and upon all that
heard these things
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in solomons
porch
but of the rest no man durst join himself unto them but the
people magnified them
and the multitude of men and women who believed in the lord was
more increased
insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and
laid them on beds and couches that when peter came his shadow at the
least might overshadow any of them and they might be delivered from
their infirmities
and there came also together to jerusalem a multitude out of the
neighbouring cities bringing sick persons and such as were troubled
with unclean spirits who were all healed
then the high priest rising up and all they that were with him
which is the heresy of the sadducees were filled with envy
and they laid hands on the apostles and put them in the common
prison
but an angel of the lord by night opening the doors of the prison
and leading them out said
go and standing speak in the temple to the people all the words
of this life
who having heard this early in the morning entered into the
temple and taught and the high priest coming and they that were with
him called together the council and all the ancients of the children of
but when the ministers came and opening the prison found them not
there they returned and told
saying the prison indeed we found shut with all diligence and
the keepers standing before the door but opening it we found no man
within
now when the officer of the temple and the chief priests heard
these words they were in doubt concerning them what would come to
pass
but one came and told them behold the men whom you put in prison
are in the temple standing and teaching the people
then went the officer with the ministers and brought them without
violence for they feared the people lest they should be stoned
and when they had brought them they set them before the council
saying commanding we commanded you that you should not teach in
this name and behold you have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and
you have a mind to bring the blood of this man upon us
but peter and the apostles answering said we ought to obey god
rather than men
the god of our fathers hath raised up jesus whom you put to
death hanging him upon a tree
him hath god exalted with his right hand to be prince and
and we are witnesses of these things and the holy ghost whom god
hath given to all that obey him
when they had heard these things they were cut to the heart and
they thought to put them to death
but one in the council rising up a pharisee named gamaliel a
doctor of the law respected by all the people commanded the men to be
put forth a little while
and he said to them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves
what you intend to do as touching these men
for before these days rose up theodas affirming himself to be
somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined
themselves who was slain and all that believed him were scattered and
brought to nothing
after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the
enrolling and drew away the people after him he also perished and
all even as many as consented to him were dispersed
and now therefore i say to you refrain from these men and let
them alone for if this council or this work be of men it will come to
nought
but if it be of god you cannot overthrow it lest perhaps you be
found even to fight against god and they consented to him
and calling in the apostles after they had scourged them they
charged them that they should not speak at all in the name of jesus and
they dismissed them
and they indeed went from the presence of the council rejoicing
that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of
and every day they ceased not in the temple and from house to
house to teach and preach christ jesus
and in those days the number of the disciples increasing there
arose a murmuring of the greeks against the hebrews for that their
widows were neglected in the daily ministration
then the twelve calling together the multitude of the disciples
said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve
tables
wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of good
reputation full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over
this business
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the
ministry of the word
and the saying was liked by all the multitude and they chose
of antioch
these they set before the apostles and they praying imposed hands
upon them
and the word of the lord increased and the number of the disciples
was multiplied in jerusalem exceedingly a great multitude also of the
priests obeyed the faith
and stephen full of grace and fortitude did great wonders and
signs among the people
now there arose some of that which is called the synagogue of the
were of cilicia and asia disputing with stephen
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit that
spoke
then they suborned men to say they had heard him speak words of
blasphemy against moses and against god
and they stirred up the people and the ancients and the scribes
and they set up false witnesses who said this man ceaseth not to
speak words against the holy place and the law
for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall
destroy this place and shall change the traditions which moses delivered
unto us
and all that sat in the council looking on him saw his face as
if it had been the face of an angel
then the high priest said are these things so
who said ye men brethren and fathers hear the god of glory
appeared to our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he
dwelt in charan
and said to him go forth out of thy country and from thy kindred
and come into the land which i shall shew thee
then he went out of the land of the chaldeans and dwelt in charan
land wherein you now dwell
and he gave him no inheritance in it no not the pace of a foot
when as yet he had no child
and god said to him that his seed should sojourn in a strange
country and that they should bring them under bondage and treat them
evil four hundred years
and the nation which they shall serve will i judge said the lord
and after these things they shall go out and shall serve me in this
place
and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so he begot isaac
and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begot jacob and jacob
the twelve patriarchs
and the patriarchs through envy sold joseph into egypt and god
was with him
and delivered him out of all his tribulations and he gave him
favour and wisdom in the sight of pharao the king of egypt and he
appointed him governor over egypt and over all his house
now there came a famine upon all egypt and chanaan and great
tribulation and our fathers found no food
but when jacob had heard that there was corn in egypt he sent our
fathers first
and at the second time joseph was known by his brethren and his
kindred was made known to pharao
and joseph sending called thither jacob his father and all his
kindred seventyfive souls
so jacob went down into egypt and he died and our fathers
and they were translated into sichem and were laid in the
sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of hemor
the son of sichem
and when the time of the promise drew near which god had promised
to abraham the people increased and were multiplied in egypt
till another king arose in egypt who knew not joseph
this same dealing craftily with our race afflicted our fathers
that they should expose their children to the end they might not be
kept alive
at the same time was moses born and he was acceptable to god who
was nourished three months in his fathers house
and when he was exposed pharaos daughter took him up and
nourished him for her own son
and moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians and
he was mighty in his words and in his deeds
and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to
visit his brethren the children of israel
and when he had seen one of them suffer wrong he defended him
and striking the egyptian he avenged him who suffered the injury
and he thought that his brethren understood that god by his hand
would save them but they understood it not
and the day following he shewed himself to them when they were at
strife and would have reconciled them in peace saying men ye are
brethren why hurt you one another
but he that did the injury to his neighbour thrust him away
saying who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us
what wilt thou kill me as thou didst yesterday kill the
and moses fled upon this word and was a stranger in the land of
and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the
desert of mount sina an angel in a flame of fire in a bush
and moses seeing it wondered at the sight and as he drew near to
view it the voice of the lord came unto him saying
i am the god of thy fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac
and the god of jacob and moses being terrified durst not behold
and the lord said to him loose the shoes from thy feet for the
place wherein thou standest is holy ground
seeing i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt
and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them and
now come and i will send thee into egypt
this moses whom they refused saying who hath appointed thee
prince and judge him god sent to be prince and redeemer by the hand of
the angel who appeared to him in the burning bush
he brought them out doing wonders and signs in the land of egypt
and in the red sea and in the desert forty years
this is that moses who said to the children of israel a prophet
shall god raise up to you of your own brethren as myself him shall you
hear
this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the
angel who spoke to him on mount sina and with our fathers who received
the words of life to give unto us
whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him away and in their
hearts turned back into egypt
saying to aaron make us gods to go before us for as for this
become of him
and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifices to the
idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands
and god turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven as it
is written in the books of the prophets did you offer victims and
sacrifices to me for forty years in the desert o house of israel
and you took unto you the tabernacle of moloch and the star of
your god rempham figures which you made to adore them and i will carry
you away beyond babylon
the tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the
desert as god ordained for them speaking to moses that he should make
it according to the form which he had seen
which also our fathers receiving brought in with jesus into the
possession of the gentiles whom god drove out before the face of our
fathers unto the days of david
who found grace before god and desired to find a tabernacle for
the god of jacob
but solomon built him a house
yet the most high dwelleth not in houses made by hands as the
prophet saith
earthly dwellings or to be contained or circumscribed by them though
otherwise by his immense divinity he is in our houses and every where
else and christ in his humanity dwelt in houses and is now on our
altars
heaven is my throne and the earth my footstool what house will
you build me saith the lord or what is the place of my resting
hath not my hand made all these things
you stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you always
resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do you also
which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they
have slain them who foretold of the coming of the just one of whom you
have been now the betrayers and murderers
who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have
not kept it
now hearing these things they were cut to the heart and they
gnashed with their teeth at him
but he being full of the holy ghost looking up steadfastly to
heaven saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of
standing on the right hand of god
and they crying out with a loud voice stopped their ears and
with one accord ran violently upon him
and casting him forth without the city they stoned him and the
witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man whose
name was saul
and they stoned stephen invoking and saying lord jesus receive
my spirit
and falling on his knees he cried with a loud voice saying
fell asleep in the lord and saul was consenting to his death
and at that time there was raised a great persecution against the
church which was at jerusalem and they were all dispersed through the
countries of judea and samaria except the apostles
and devout men took order for stephens funeral and made great
mourning over him
but saul made havock of the church entering in from house to
house and dragging away men and women committed them to prison
they therefore that were dispersed went about preaching the word of
and philip going down to the city of samaria preached christ unto
them
and the people with one accord were attentive to those things which
were said by philip hearing and seeing the miracles which he did
for many of them who had unclean spirits crying with a loud voice
went out
and many taken with the palsy and that were lame were healed
there was therefore great joy in that city now there was a certain
man named simon who before had been a magician in that city seducing
the people of samaria giving out that he was some great one
to whom they all gave ear from the least to the greatest saying
and they were attentive to him because for a long time he had
bewitched them with his magical practices
but when they had believed philip preaching of the kingdom of god
in the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women
then simon himself believed also and being baptized he adhered
to philip and being astonished wondered to see the signs and exceeding
great miracles which were done
now when the apostles who were in jerusalem had heard that
who when they were come prayed for them that they might receive
the holy ghost
for he was not as yet come upon any of them but they were only
baptized in the name of the lord jesus
then they laid their hands upon them and they received the holy
sacrament of confirmation by imposition of hands and prayer and the
faithful thereby received the holy ghost not but they had received the
grace of the holy ghost at their baptism yet not that plenitude of
grace and those spiritual gifts which they afterwards received from
bishops in the sacrament of confirmation which strengthened them to
profess their faith publicly
and when simon saw that by the imposition of the hands of the
apostles the holy ghost was given he offered them money
saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i shall lay my
hands he may receive the holy ghost but peter said to him
keep thy money to thyself to perish with thee because thou hast
thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money
thou hast no part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not
right in the sight of god
do penance therefore for this thy wickedness and pray to god
that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee
for i see thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of
iniquity
then simon answering said pray you for me to the lord that none
of these things which you have spoken may come upon me
and they indeed having testified and preached the word of the
of the samaritans
now an angel of the lord spoke to philip saying arise go
towards the south to the way that goeth down from jerusalem into gaza
this is desert
and rising up he went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch
of great authority under candace the queen of the ethiopians who had
charge over all her treasures had come to jerusalem to adore
and he was returning sitting in his chariot and reading isaias
the prophet
and the spirit said to philip go near and join thyself to this
chariot
and philip running thither heard him reading the prophet isaias
who said and how can i unless some man shew me and he desired
and the place of the scripture which he was reading was this he
was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb without voice
before his shearer so openeth he not his mouth
in humility his judgment was taken away his generation who shall
declare for his life shall be taken from the earth
and the eunuch answering philip said i beseech thee of whom
doth the prophet speak this of himself or of some other man
then philip opening his mouth and beginning at this scripture
preached unto him jesus
and as they went on their way they came to a certain water and
the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me from being
baptized
and philip said if thou believest with all thy heart thou
mayest and he answering said i believe that jesus christ is the son
of god
mentions only one disposition as here belief when others equally
necessary are not expressed viz a sorrow for sins a firm hope and
the love of god moreover believing with the whole heart signifies a
belief of every thing necessary for salvation
and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down
into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him
and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the
his way rejoicing
but philip was found in azotus and passing through he preached
the gospel to all the cities till he came to caesarea
life
and saul as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
the disciples of the lord went to the high priest
and asked of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he
found any men and women of this way he might bring them bound to
and as he went on his journey it came to pass that he drew nigh to
and falling on the ground he heard a voice saying to him saul
who said who art thou lord and he i am jesus whom thou
persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the goad
and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have
me to do
and the lord said to him arise and go into the city and there it
shall be told thee what thou must do now the men who went in company
with him stood amazed hearing indeed a voice but seeing no man
and saul arose from the ground and when his eyes were opened he
saw nothing but they leading him by the hands brought him to
and he was there three days without sight and he did neither eat
nor drink
now there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and
the lord said to him in a vision ananias and he said behold i am
here lord
and the lord said to him arise and go into the street that is
called strait and seek in the house of judas one named saul of tarsus
and he saw a man named ananias coming in and putting his hands
upon him that he might receive his sight
but ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man how
much evil he hath done to thy saints in jerusalem
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that
invoke thy name
and the lord said to him go thy way for this man is to me a
vessel of election to carry my name before the gentiles and kings and
the children of israel
for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my names
sake
and ananias went his way and entered into the house and laying
his hands upon him he said brother saul the lord jesus hath sent me
he that appeared to thee in the way as thou camest that thou mayest
receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales and he
received his sight and rising up he was baptized
and when he had taken meat he was strengthened and he was with
the disciples that were at damascus for some days
and immediately he preached jesus in the synagogues that he is
the son of god
and all that heard him were astonished and said is not this he
who persecuted in jerusalem those that called upon this name and came
hither for that intent that he might carry them bound to the chief
priests
but saul increased much more in strength and confounded the jews
who dwelt at damascus affirming that this is the christ
and when many days were passed the jews consulted together to
kill him
but their lying in wait was made known to saul and they watched
the gates also day and night that they might kill him
but the disciples taking him in the night conveyed him away by
the wall letting him down in a basket
and when he was come into jerusalem he essayed to join himself to
the disciples and they all were afraid of him not believing that he
was a disciple
but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and told
them how he had seen the lord and that he had spoken to him and how in
and he was with them coming in and going out in jerusalem and
dealing confidently in the name of the lord
he spoke also to the gentiles and disputed with the greeks but
they sought to kill him
which when the brethren had known they brought him down to
now the church had peace throughout all judea and galilee and
filled with the consolation of the holy ghost
and it came to pass that peter as he passed through visiting
all came to the saints who dwelt at lydda
and he found there a certain man named eneas who had kept his bed
for eight years who was ill of the palsy
and peter said to him eneas the lord jesus christ healeth thee
and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him who were converted
to the lord
and in joppe there was a certain disciple named tabitha which by
interpretation is called dorcas this woman was full of good works and
almsdeeds which she did
and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom
when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber
and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppe the disciples hearing
that peter was there sent unto him two men desiring him that he would
not be slack to come unto them
and peter rising up went with them and when he was come they
brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood about him
weeping and shewing him the coats and garments which dorcas made them
and they all being put forth peter kneeling down prayed and
turning to the body he said tabitha arise and she opened her eyes
and seeing peter sat up
and giving her his hand he lifted her up and when he had called
the saints and the widows he presented her alive
and it was made known throughout all joppe and many believed in
the lord
and it cane to pass that he abode many days in joppe with one
and there was a certain man in caesarea named cornelius a
centurion of that which is called the italian band
a religious man and fearing god with all his house giving much
alms to the people and always praying to god
this man saw in a vision manifestly about the ninth hour of the
day an angel of god coming in unto him and saying to him cornelius
and he beholding him being seized with fear said what is it
memorial in the sight of god
and now send men to joppe and call hither one simon who is
surnamed peter
he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is by the sea
side he will tell thee what thou must do
and when the angel who spoke to him was departed he called two of
his household servants and a soldier who feared the lord of them that
were under him
to whom when he had related all he sent them to joppe
and on the next day whilst they were going on their journey and
drawing nigh to the city peter went up to the higher parts of the house
to pray about the sixth hour
and being hungry he was desirous to taste somewhat and as they
were preparing there came upon him an ecstasy of mind
and he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel descending as
it were a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from heaven to
the earth
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things
of the earth and fowls of the air
and there came a voice to him arise peter kill and eat
but peter said far be it from me for i never did eat any thing
that is common and unclean
and the voice spoke to him again the second time that which god
hath cleansed do not thou call common
and this was done thrice and presently the vessel was taken up
into heaven
now whilst peter was doubting within himself what the vision
that he had seen should mean behold the men who were sent from
and when they had called they asked if simon who is surnamed
and as peter was thinking of the vision the spirit said to him
arise therefore get thee down and go with them doubting
nothing for i have sent them
then peter going down to the men said behold i am he whom you
seek what is the cause for which you are come
who said cornelius a centurion a just man and one that feareth
an answer of an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear
words of thee
then bringing them in he lodged them and the day following he
arose and went with them and some of the brethren from joppe
accompanied him
and the morrow after he entered into caesarea and cornelius
waited for them having called together his kinsmen and special friends
and it came to pass that when peter was come in cornelius came
to meet him and falling at his feet adored
but peter lifted him up saying arise i myself also am a man
and talking with him he went in and found many that were come
together
and he said to them you know how abominable it is for a man that
is a jew to keep company or to come unto one of another nation but god
hath shewed to me to call no man common or unclean
for which cause making no doubt i came when i was sent for i
ask therefore for what cause you have sent for me
and cornelius said four days ago unto this hour i was praying
in my house at the ninth hour and behold a man stood before me in white
apparel and said
cornelius thy prayer is heard and thy alms are had in
remembrance in the sight of god
send therefore to joppe and call hither simon who is surnamed
immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou hast done well in
coming now therefore all we are present in thy sight to hear all
things whatsoever are commanded thee by the lord
and peter opening his mouth said in very deed i perceive that
but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh justice is
acceptable to him
also of what nation soever are acceptable to god if they fear him and
work justice but then true faith is always to be presupposed without
which saith st paul heb it is impossible to please god
that men of all religions may be pleasing to god for since none but the
true religion can be from god all other religions must be from the
father of lies and therefore highly displeasing to the god of truth
god sent the word to the children of israel preaching peace by
you know the word which hath been published through all judea
for it began from galilee after the baptism which john preached
jesus of nazareth how god anointed him with the holy ghost and
with power who went about doing good and healing all that were
oppressed by the devil for god was with him
and we are witnesses of all things that he did in the land of the
him god raised up the third day and gave him to be made manifest
not to all the people but to witnesses preordained by god even
to us who did eat and drink with him after he arose again from the
dead
and he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that
it is he who was appointed by god to be judge of the living and of the
dead
to him all the prophets give testimony that by his name all
receive remission of sins who believe in him
while peter was yet speaking these words the holy ghost fell on
all them that heard the word
and the faithful of the circumcision who came with peter were
astonished for that the grace of the holy ghost was poured out upon the
for they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying god
then peter answered can any man forbid water that these should
not be baptized who have received the holy ghost as well as we
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord
and the apostles and brethren who were in judea heard that the
and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the
circumcision contended with him
saying why didst thou go in to men uncircumcised and didst eat
with them
but peter began and declared to them the matter in order saying
i was in the city of joppe praying and i saw in an ecstasy of
mind a vision a certain vessel descending as it were a great sheet let
down from heaven by four corners and it came even unto me
into which looking i considered and saw fourfooted creatures of
the earth and beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air
and i heard also a voice saying to me arise peter kill and eat
and i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath ever
entered into my mouth
and the voice answered again from heaven what god hath made
clean do not thou call common
and this was done three times and all were taken up again into
heaven
and behold immediately there were three men come to the house
wherein i was sent to me from caesarea
and the spirit said to me that i should go with them nothing
doubting and these six brethren went with me also and we entered into
the mans house
and he told us how he had seen an angel in his house standing
and saying to him send to joppe and call hither simon who is surnamed
who shall speak to thee words whereby thou shalt be saved and
all thy house
and when i had begun to speak the holy ghost fell upon them as
upon us also in the beginning
and i remembered the word of the lord how that he said john
indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy
if then god gave them the same grace as to us also who believed
in the lord jesus christ who was i that could withstand god
having heard these things they held their peace and glorified
life
now they who had been dispersed by the persecution that arose on
occasion of stephen went about as far as phenice and cyprus and antioch
speaking the word to none but to the jews only
but some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene who when they
were entered into antioch spoke also to the greeks preaching the lord
and the hand of he lord was with them and a great number
believing were converted to the lord
and the tidings came to the ears of the church that was at
who when he was come and had seen the grace of god rejoiced
for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith
and barnabas went to tarsus to seek saul whom when he had
found he brought to antioch
and they conversed there in the church a whole year and they
taught a great multitude so that at antioch the disciples were first
named christians
and in these days there came prophets from jerusalem to antioch
and one of them named agabus rising up signified by the spirit
that there should be a great famine over the whole world which came to
pass under claudius
and the disciples every man according to his ability purposed
to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in judea
which also they did sending it to the ancients by the hands of
punishment
and at the same time herod the king stretched forth his hands to
afflict some of the church
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword
and seeing that it pleased the jews he proceeded to take up peter
also now it was in the days of the azymes
answers to our easter
and when he had apprehended him he cast him into prison
delivering him to four files of soldiers to be kept intending after
the pasch to bring him forth to the people
peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without
ceasing by the church unto god for him
and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter
was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the
keepers before the door kept the prison
and behold an angel of the lord stood by him and a light shined in
the room and he striking peter on the side raised him up saying
and the angel said to him gird thyself and put on thy sandals
follow me
and going out he followed him and he knew not that it was true
which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision
and passing through the first and the second ward they came to
the iron gate that leadeth to the city which of itself opened to them
angel departed from him
and peter coming to himself said now i know in very deed that
the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of
and considering he came to the house of mary the mother of john
who was surnamed mark where many were gathered together and praying
and when he knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to
hearken whose name was rhode
and as soon as she knew peters voice she opened not the gate
for joy but running in she told that peter stood before the gate
but they said to her thou art mad but she affirmed that it was
so then said they it is his angel
but peter continued knocking and when they had opened they saw
him and were astonished
but he beckoning to them with his hand to hold their peace told
how the lord had brought him out of prison and he said tell these
things to james and to the brethren and going out he went into another
place
now when day was come there was no small stir among the
soldiers what was become of peter
and when herod had sought for him and found him not having
examined the keepers he commanded they should be put to death and
going down from judea to caesarea he abode there
and he was angry with the tyrians and the sidonians but they
with one accord came to him and having gained blastus who was the
kings chamberlain they desired peace because their countries were
nourished by him
and upon a day appointed herod being arrayed in kingly apparel
sat in the judgment seat and made an oration to them
and the people made acclamation saying it is the voice of a
god and not of a man
and forthwith an angel of the lord struck him because he had not
given the honour to god and being eaten up by worms he gave up the
ghost
but the word of the lord increased and multiplied
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem having fulfilled
their ministry taking with them john who was surnamed mark
now there were in the church which was at antioch prophets and
doctors among whom was barnabas and simon who was called niger and
tetrarch and saul
and as they were ministering to the lord and fasting the holy
whereunto i have taken them
then they fasting and praying and imposing their hands upon them
sent them away
so they being sent by the holy ghost went to seleucia and from
thence they sailed to cyprus
and when they were come to salamina they preached the word of god
in the synagogues of the jews and they had john also in the ministry
and when they had gone through the whole island as far as paphos
they found a certain man a magician a false prophet a jew whose name
was barjesu
who was with the proconsul sergius paulus a prudent man he
sending for barnabas and saul desired to hear the word of god
but elymas the magician for so his name is interpreted withstood
them seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith
then saul otherwise paul filled with the holy ghost looking
upon him
said o full of all guile and of all deceit child of the devil
enemy of all justice thou ceases not to pervert the right ways of the
and now behold the hand of the lord is upon thee and thou shalt
be blind not seeing the sun for a time and immediately there fell a
mist and darkness upon him and going about he sought some one to lead
him by the hand
then the proconsul when he had seen what was done believed
admiring at the doctrine of the lord
now when paul and they that were with him had sailed from paphos
they came to perge in pamphylia and john departing from them returned
to jerusalem
but they passing through perge came to antioch in pisidia and
entering into the synagogue on the sabbath day they sat down
and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of
the synagogue sent to them saying ye men brethren if you have any
word of exhortation to make to the people speak
then paul rising up and with his hand bespeaking silence said
the god of the people of israel chose our fathers and exalted the
people when they were sojourners in the land of egypt and with an high
arm brought them out from thence
and for the space of forty years endured their manners in the
desert
and destroying seven nations in the land of chaanan divided
their land among them by lot
as it were after four hundred and fifty years and after these
things he gave unto them judges until samuel the prophet
and after that they desired a king and god gave them saul the
son of cis a man of the tribe of benjamin forty years
and when he had removed him he raised them up david to be king
to whom giving testimony he said i have found david the son of jesse
a man according to my own heart who shall do all my wills
of this mans seed god according to his promise hath raised up
to israel a saviour jesus
john first preaching before his coming the baptism of penance
to all the people of israel
and when john was fulfilling his course he said i am not he
whom you think me to be but behold there cometh one after me whose
shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose
men brethren children of the stock of abraham and whosoever
among you fear god to you the word of this salvation is sent
for they that inhabited jerusalem and the rulers thereof not
knowing him nor the voices of the prophets which are read every
sabbath judging him have fulfilled them
and finding no cause of death in him they desired of pilate that
they might kill him
and when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him
taking him down from the tree they laid him in a sepulchre
but god raised him up from the dead the third day
who was seen for many days by them who came up with him from
people
and we declare unto you that the promise which was made to our
fathers
this same god hath fulfilled to our children raising up jesus
as in the second psalm also is written thou art my son this day have i
begotten thee
and to shew that he raised him up from the dead not to return
now any more to corruption he said thus i will give you the holy
things of david faithful
faithfully fulfil the promises i made to david
and therefore in another place also he saith thou shalt not
suffer thy holy one to see corruption
for david when he had served in his generation according to the
will of god slept and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption
but he whom god hath raised from the dead saw no corruption
be it known therefore to you men brethren that through him
forgiveness of sins is preached to you and from all the things from
which you could not be justified by the law of moses
in him every one that believeth is justified
beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken in the
prophets
behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i work a work in
your days a work which you will not believe if any man shall tell it
you
and as they went out they desired them that on the next sabbath
they would speak unto them these words
and when the synagogue was broken up many of the jews and of the
strangers who served god followed paul and barnabas who speaking to
them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god
but the next sabbath day the whole city almost came together to
hear the word of god
and the jews seeing the multitudes were filled with envy and
contradicted those things which were said by paul blaspheming
then paul and barnabas said boldly to you it behoved us first to
speak the word of god but because you reject it and judge yourselves
unworthy of eternal life behold we turn to the gentiles
for so the lord hath commanded us i have set thee to be the
light of the gentiles that thou mayest be for salvation unto the utmost
part of the earth
and the gentiles hearing it were glad and glorified the word of
the lord and as many as were ordained to life everlasting believed
and the word of the lord was published throughout the whole
country
but the jews stirred up religious and honourable women and the
chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and barnabas
and cast them out of their coasts
but they shaking off the dust of their feet against them came
to iconium
and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost
and it came to pass in iconium that they entered together into the
synagogue of the jews and so spoke that a very great multitude both of
the jews and of the greeks did believe
but the unbelieving jews stirred up and incensed the minds of the
a long time therefore they abode there dealing confidently in the
wonders to be done by their hands
and the multitude of the city was divided and some of them indeed
held with the jews but some with the apostles
and when there was an assault made by the gentiles and the jews
with their rulers to use them contumeliously and to stone them
they understanding it fled to lystra and derbe cities of
the gospel
and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet a
cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked
this same heard paul speaking who looking upon him and seeing
that he had faith to be healed
said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped
up and walked
and when the multitudes had seen what paul had done they lifted
up their voice in the lycaonian tongue saying the gods are come down
to us in the likeness of men
and they called barnabas jupiter but paul mercury because he
was chief speaker
the priest also of jupiter that was before the city bringing
oxen and garlands before the gate would have offered sacrifice with the
people
which when the apostles barnabas and paul had heard rending
their clothes they leaped out among the people crying
and saying ye men why do ye these things we also are mortals
men like unto you preaching to you to be converted from these vain
things to the living god who made the heaven and the earth and the sea
and all things that are in them
who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
ways
nevertheless he left not himself without testimony doing good
from heaven giving rains and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with
food and gladness
and speaking these things they scarce restrained the people from
sacrificing to them
now there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium
and persuading the multitude and stoning paul drew him out of the
city thinking him to be dead
but as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and
entered into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to
and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught
many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and to antioch
confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to
continue in the faith and that through many tribulations we must enter
into the kingdom of god
and when they had ordained to them priests in every church and
had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord in whom they
believed
and passing through pisidia they came into pamphylia
and having spoken the word of the lord in perge they went down
into attalia
and thence they sailed to antioch from whence they had been
delivered to the grace of god unto the work which they accomplished
and when they were come and had assembled the church they
related what great things god had done with them and how he had opened
the door of faith to the gentiles
and they abode no small time with the disciples
of jerusalem
and some coming down from judea taught the brethren that
except you be circumcised after the manner of moses you cannot be
saved
and when paul and barnabas had no small contest with them they
determined that paul and barnabas and certain others of the other side
should go up to the apostles and priests to jerusalem about this
question
they therefore being brought on their way by the church passed
through phenice and samaria relating the conversion of the gentiles
and when they were come to jerusalem they were received by the
church and by the apostles and ancients declaring how great things god
had done with them
but there arose of the sect of the pharisees some that believed
saying they must be circumcised and be commanded to observe the law of
and the apostles and ancients assembled to consider of this
matter
and when there had been much disputing peter rising up said to
them men brethren you know that in former days god made choice among
us that by my mouth the gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and
believe
and god who knoweth the hearts gave testimony giving unto them
the holy ghost as well as to us
and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts
by faith
now therefore why tempt you god to put a yoke upon the necks of
the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear
but by the grace of the lord jesus christ we believe to be
saved in like manner as they also
and all the multitude held their peace and they heard barnabas
and paul telling what great signs and wonders god had wrought among the
and after they had held their peace james answered saying men
brethren hear me
simon hath related how god first visited to take to the gentiles
a people to his name
and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written
after these things i will return and will rebuild the tabernacle
of david which is fallen down and the ruins thereof i will rebuild
that the residue of men may seek after the lord and all nations
upon whom my name is invoked saith the lord who doth these things
to the lord was his own work known from the beginning of the
world
for which cause judge that they who from among the gentiles are
converted to god are not to be disquieted
but that we write unto them that they refrain themselves from
the pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled
and from blood
for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him in
the synagogues where he is read every sabbath
then it pleased the apostles and ancients with the whole church
to choose men of their own company and to send to antioch with paul and
among the brethren
writing by their hands the apostles and ancients brethren to
the brethren of the gentiles that are at antioch and in syria and
forasmuch as we have heard that some going out from us have
troubled you with words subverting your souls to whom we gave no
commandment
it hath seemed good to us being assembled together to choose
out men and to send them unto you with our well beloved barnabas and
men that have given their lives for the name of our lord jesus
we have sent therefore judas and silas who themselves also will
by word of mouth tell you the same things
for it hath seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay no
further burden upon you than these necessary things
that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood
and from things strangled and from fornication from which things
keeping yourselves you shall do well fare ye well
of their own nature indifferent was here prohibited to bring the jews
more easily to admit of the society of the gentiles and to exercise the
latter in obedience but this prohibition was but temporary and has
long since ceased to oblige more especially in the western churches
they therefore being dismissed went down to antioch and
gathering together the multitude delivered the epistle
which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation
but judas and silas being prophets also themselves with many
words comforted the brethren and confirmed them
and after they had spent some time there they were let go with
peace by the brethren unto them that had sent them
but it seemed good unto silas to remain there and judas alone
departed to jerusalem
and paul and barnabas continued at antioch teaching and
preaching with many others the word of the lord
and after some days paul said to barnabas let us return and
visit our brethren in all the cities wherein we have preached the word
of the lord to see how they do
and barnabas would have taken with them john also that was
surnamed mark
but paul desired that he as having departed from them out of
and there arose a dissension so that they departed one from
another and barnabas indeed taking mark sailed to cyprus
but paul choosing silas departed being delivered by the
brethren to the grace of god
and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches
commanding them to keep the precepts of the apostles and the ancients
scourged at philippi
and he came to derbe and lystra and behold there was a certain
disciple there named timothy the son of a jewish woman that believed
but his father was a gentile
to this man the brethren that were in lystra and iconium gave a
good testimony
him paul would have to go along with him and taking him he
circumcised him because of the jews who were in those places for they
all knew that his father was a gentile
and as they passed through the cities they delivered unto them
the decrees for to keep that were decreed by the apostles and ancients
who were at jerusalem
and the churches were confirmed in faith and increased in number
daily
and when they had passed through phrygia and the country of
and when they were come into mysia they attempted to go into
and when they had passed through mysia they went down to troas
and a vision was shewed to paul in the night which was a man of
and as soon as he had seen the vision immediately we sought to
go into macedonia being assured that god had called us to preach the
gospel to them
and sailing from troas we came with a straight course to
and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of part of
together
and upon the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a
river side where it seemed that there was prayer and sitting down we
spoke to the women that were assembled
and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city
of thyatira one that worshipped god did hear whose heart the lord
opened to attend to those things which were said by paul
and when she was baptized and her household she besought us
saying if you have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my
house and abide there and she constrained us
and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain girl having
a pythonical spirit met us who brought to her masters much gain by
divining
fortunes
this same following paul and us cried out saying these men are
the servants of the most high god who preach unto you the way of
salvation
and this she did many days but paul being grieved turned and
said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to go
from her and he went out the same hour
but her masters seeing that the hope of their gain was gone
apprehending paul and silas brought them into the market place to the
rulers
and presenting them to the magistrates they said these men
disturb our city being jews
and preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive nor
observe being romans
and the people ran together against them and the magistrates
rending off their clothes commanded them to be beaten with rods
and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them
into prison charging the gaoler to keep them diligently
who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner
prison and made their feet fast in the stocks
and at midnight paul and silas praying praised god and they
that were in prison heard them
and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the
foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors
were opened and the bands of all were loosed
and the keeper of the prison awakening out of his sleep and
seeing the doors of the prison open drawing his sword would have
killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled
but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for
we all are here
then calling for a light he went in and trembling fell down at
the feet of paul and silas
and bringing them out he said masters what must i do that i
may be saved
but they said believe in the lord jesus and thou shalt be
saved and thy house
and they preached the word of the lord to him and to all that
were in his house
and he taking them the same hour of the night washed their
stripes and himself was baptized and all his house immediately
and when he had brought them into his own house he laid the
table for them and rejoiced with all his house believing god
and when the day was come the magistrates sent the serjeants
saying let those men go
and the keeper of the prison told these words to paul the
magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in
peace
but paul said to them they have beaten us publicly uncondemned
men that are romans and have cast us into prison and now do they
thrust us out privately not so but let them come
and let us out themselves and the serjeants told these words to
the magistrates and they were afraid hearing that they were romans
and coming they besought them and bringing them out they
desired them to depart out of the city
and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of
and when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they
came to thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the jews
and paul according to his custom went in unto them and for
three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures
declaring and insinuating that the christ was to suffer and to
rise again from the dead and that this is jesus christ whom i preach
to you
and some of them believed and were associated to paul and silas
and of those that served god and of the gentiles a great multitude and
of noble women not a few
but the jews moved with envy and taking unto them some wicked men
of the vulgar sort and making a tumult set the city in an uproar and
besetting jasons house sought to bring them out unto the people
and not finding them they drew jason and certain brethren to the
rulers of the city crying they that set the city in an uproar are come
hither also
whom jason hath received and these all do contrary to the decrees
of caesar saying that there is another king jesus
and they stirred up the people and the rulers of the city
hearing these things
and having taken satisfaction of jason and of the rest they let
them go
but the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night
unto berea who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of
the jews
now these were more noble than those in thessalonica who
received the word with all eagerness daily searching the scriptures
whether these things were so
embracing the truth and searching the scriptures to find out the texts
alleged by the apostle which was a far more generous proceeding than
that of their countrymen at thessalonica who persecuted the preachers
of the gospel without examining the grounds they alleged for what they
taught
and many indeed of them believed and of honourable women that
were gentiles and of men not a few
and when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of
up and troubling the multitude
and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go unto the
sea but silas and timothy remained there
and they that conducted paul brought him as far as athens and
receiving a commandment from him to silas and timothy that they should
come to him with all speed they departed
now whilst paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred
within him seeing the city wholly given to idolatry
he disputed therefore in the synagogue with the jews and with
them that served god and in the market place every day with them that
were there
and certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoics
disputed with him and some said what is it that this word sower would
say but others he seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods because he
preached to them jesus and the resurrection
and taking him they brought him to the areopagus saying may we
know what this new doctrine is which thou speakest of
for thou bringest in certain new things to our ears we would
know therefore what these things mean
now all the athenians and strangers that were there employed
themselves in nothing else but either in telling or in hearing some new
thing
but paul standing in the midst of the areopagus said ye men of
for passing by and seeing your idols i found an altar also on
which was written to the unknown god what therefore you worship
without knowing it that i preach to you
god who made the world and all things therein he being lord of
heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands
need them for his dwelling or any other uses as the heathens imagined
neither is he served with mens hands as though he needed any
thing seeing it is he who giveth to all life and breath and all things
and hath made of one all mankind to dwell upon the whole face
of the earth determining appointed times and the limits of their
habitation
that they should seek god if haply they may feel after him or
find him although he be not far from every one of us
for in him we live and move and are as some also of your own
poets said for we are also his offspring
being therefore the offspring of god we must not suppose the
divinity to be like unto gold or silver or stone the graving of art and
device of man
and god indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance now
declareth unto men that all should every where do penance
because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world
in equity by the man whom he hath appointed giving faith to all by
raising him up from the dead
and when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead some
indeed mocked but others said we will hear thee again concerning this
matter
so paul went out from among them
but certain men adhering to him did believe among whom was
also dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with
them
places apollo goes to corinth
after these things departing from athens he came to corinth
and finding a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately
come from italy with priscilla his wife because that claudius had
commanded all jews to depart from rome he came to them
and because he was of the same trade he remained with them and
wrought now they were tentmakers by trade
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath bringing in the
name of the lord jesus and he persuaded the jews and the greeks
and when silas and timothy were come from macedonia paul was
earnest in preaching testifying to the jews that jesus is the christ
but they gainsaying and blaspheming he shook his garments and
said to them your blood be upon your own heads i am clean from
henceforth i will go unto the gentiles
and departing thence he entered into the house of a certain man
named titus justus one that worshipped god whose house was adjoining
to the synagogue
and crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the lord
with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and
were baptized
and the lord said to paul in the night by a vision do not fear
but speak and hold not thy peace
because i am with thee and no man shall set upon thee to hurt
thee for i have much people in this city
and he stayed there a year and six months teaching among them
the word of god
but when gallio was proconsul of achaia the jews with one accord
rose up against paul and brought him to the judgment seat
saying this man persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the
law
and when paul was beginning to open his mouth gallio said to the
should with reason bear with you
but if they be questions of word and names and of your law look
you to it i will not be judge of such things
and he drove them from the judgment seat
and all laying hold on sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue
beat him before the judgment seat and gallio cared for none of those
things
but paul when he had stayed yet many days taking his leave of
the brethren sailed thence into syria and with him priscilla and
and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself
entering into the synagogue disputed with the jews
and when they desired him that he would tarry a longer time he
consented not
but taking his leave and saying i will return to you again god
willing he departed from ephesus
and going down to caesarea he went up to jerusalem and saluted
the church and so came down to antioch
and after he had spent some time there he departed and went
through the country of galatia and phrygia in order confirming all the
disciples
now a certain jew named apollo born at alexandria an eloquent
man came to ephesus one mighty in the scriptures
this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent
in spirit spoke and taught diligently the things that are of jesus
knowing only the baptism of john
this man therefore began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom
when priscilla and aquila had heard they took him to them and expounded
to him the way of the lord more diligently
and whereas he was desirous to go to achaia the brethren
exhorting wrote to the disciples to receive him who when he was come
helped them much who had believed
for with much vigour he convinced the jews openly shewing by the
scriptures that jesus is the christ
and it came to pass while apollo was at corinth that paul
having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and found
certain disciples
and he said to them have you received the holy ghost since ye
believed but they said to him we have not so much as heard whether
there be a holy ghost
and he said in what then were you baptized who said in johns
baptism
then paul said john baptized the people with the baptism of
penance saying that they should believe in him who was to come after
him that is to say in jesus
having heard these things they were baptized in the name of the
and when paul had imposed his hands on them the holy ghost came
upon them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied
and all the men were about twelve
and entering into the synagogue he spoke boldly for the space of
three months disputing and exhorting concerning the kingdom of god
but when some were hardened and believed not speaking evil of the
way of the lord before the multitude departing from them he separated
the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus
and this continued for the space of two years so that all who
dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord both jews and gentiles
and god wrought by the hand of paul more than common miracles
so that even there were brought from his body to the sick
handkerchiefs and aprons and the diseases departed from them and the
wicked spirits went out of them
now some also of the jewish exorcists who went about attempted
to invoke over them that had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus
saying i conjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth
and there were certain men seven sons of sceva a jew a chief
priest that did this
but the wicked spirit answering said to them jesus i know and
and the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaping upon them and
mastering them both prevailed against them so that they fled out of
that house naked and wounded
and this became known to all the jews and the gentiles that dwelt
a ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was
magnified
and many of them that believed came confessing and declaring
their deeds
and many of them who had followed curious arts brought together
their books and burnt them before all and counting the price of them
they found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of silver
so mightily grew the word of god and was confirmed
and when these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit
when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem
saying after i have been there i must see rome also
and sending into macedonia two of them that ministered to him
now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way
of the lord
for a certain man named demetrius a silversmith who made silver
temples for diana brought no small gain to the craftsmen
whom he calling together with the workmen of like occupation
said sirs you know that our gain is by this trade
and you see and hear that this paul by persuasion hath drawn
away a great multitude not only of ephesus but almost of all asia
saying they are not gods which are made by hands
so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought
but also the temple of great diana shall be reputed for nothing yea
and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed whom all asia and the world
worshippeth
having heard these things they were full of anger and cried out
saying great is diana of the ephesians
and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught
with one accord into the theatre
and when paul would have entered in unto the people the
disciples suffered him not
and some also of the rulers of asia who were his friends sent
unto him desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre
now some cried one thing some another for the assembly was
confused and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come
together
and they drew forth alexander out of the multitude the jews
thrusting him forward and alexander beckoning with his hand for
silence would have given the people satisfaction
but as soon as they perceived him to be a jew all with one
voice for the space of about two hours cried out great is diana of
the ephesians
and when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes he said ye
men of ephesus what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the
for as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted you
ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly
for you have brought hither these men who are neither guilty of
sacrilege nor of blasphemy against your goddess
but if demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a
matter against any man the courts of justice are open and there are
proconsuls let them accuse one another
and if you inquire after any other matter it may be decided in a
lawful assembly
for we are even in danger to be called in question for this days
uproar there being no man guilty of whom we may give account of this
concourse and when he had said these things he dismissed the assembly
at troas his discourse to the clergy of ephesus
and after the tumult was ceased paul calling to him the disciples
and exhorting them took his leave and set forward to go into macedonia
and when he had gone over those parts and had exhorted them with
many words he came into greece
where when he had spent three months the jews laid wait for him
as he was about to sail into syria so he took a resolution to return
through macedonia
and there accompanied him sopater the son of pyrrhus of berea
and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe
and timothy and of asia tychicus and trophimus
these going before stayed for us at troas
but we sailed from philippi after the days of the azymes and came
to them to troas in five days where we abode seven days
and on the first day of the week when we were assembled to break
bread paul discoursed with them being to depart on the morrow and he
continued his speech until midnight
interpreters of the scripture explain that the christians even at this
time must have changed the sabbath into the first day of the week the
made by the authority of the church hence the exercise of the power
which christ had given to her for he is lord of the sabbath
and there were a great number of lamps in the upper chamber where
we were assembled
and a certain young man named eutychus sitting on the window
being oppressed with a deep sleep as paul was long preaching by
occasion of his sleep fell from the third loft down and was taken up
dead
to whom when paul had gone down he laid himself upon him and
embracing him said be not troubled for his soul is in him
then going up and breaking bread and tasting and having talked a
long time to them until daylight so he departed
and they brought the youth alive and were not a little comforted
but we going aboard the ship sailed to assos being there to
take in paul for so he had appointed himself purposing to travel by
land
and when he had met with us at assos we took him in and came to
and sailing thence the day following we came over against chios
and the next day we arrived at samos and the day following we came to
for paul had determined to sail by ephesus lest he should be
stayed any time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to
keep the day of pentecost at jerusalem
and sending from miletus to ephesus he called the ancients of
the church
and when they were come to him and were together he said to
them you know from the first day that i came into asia in what manner
serving the lord with all humility and with tears and temptations
which befell me by the conspiracies of the jews
how i have kept back nothing that was profitable to you but have
preached it to you and taught you publicly and from house to house
testifying both to jews and gentiles penance towards god and
faith in our lord jesus christ
and now behold being bound in the spirit i go to jerusalem
not knowing the things which shall befall me there
save that the holy ghost in every city witnesseth to me saying
but i fear none of these things neither do i count my life more
precious than myself so that i may consummate my course and the
ministry of the word which i received from the lord jesus to testify
the gospel of the grace of god
and now behold i know that all you among whom i have gone
preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more
wherefore i take you to witness this day that i am clear from the
blood of all men
for i have not spread to declare unto you all the counsel of
take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock wherein the holy
purchased with his own blood
i know that after my departure ravening wolves will enter in
among you not sparing the flock
and of your own selves shall arise men speaking perverse things
to draw away disciples after them
therefore watch keeping in memory that for three years i ceased
not with tears to admonish every one of you night and day
and now i commend you to god and to the word of his grace who is
able to build up and to give an inheritance among all the sanctified
i have not coveted any mans silver gold or apparel as
you yourselves know for such things as were needful for me and
them that are with me these hands have furnished
i have shewed you all things how that so labouring you ought to
support the weak and to remember the word of the lord jesus how he
said it is a more blessed thing to give rather than to receive
and when he had said these things kneeling down he prayed with
them all
and there was much weeping among them all and falling on the
neck of paul they kissed him
being grieved most of all for the word which he had said that
they should see his face no more and they brought him on his way to the
ship
and when it came to pass that being parted from them we set
sail we came with a straight course to coos and the day following to
and when we had found a ship sailing over to phenice we went
aboard and set forth
and when we had discovered cyprus leaving it on the left hand we
sailed into syria and came to tyre for there the ship was to unlade
her burden
and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to
and the days being expired departing we went forward they all
bringing us on our way with their wives and children till we were out
of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and we prayed
and when we had bid one another farewell we took ship and they
returned home
but we having finished the voyage by sea from tyre came down to
and the next day departing we came to caesarea and entering into
the house of philip the evangelist who was one of the seven we abode
with him
before converted the samaritans and baptized the eunuch chap
being one of the first seven deacons
and he had four daughters virgins who did prophesy
and as we tarried there for some days there came from judea a
certain prophet named agabus
who when he was come to us took pauls girdle and binding his
own feet and hands he said thus saith the holy ghost the man whose
girdle this is the jews shall bind in this manner in jerusalem and
shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles
which when we had heard both we and they that were of that place
desired him that he would not go up to jerusalem
then paul answered and said what do you mean weeping and
afflicting my heart for i am ready not only to be bound but to die
also in jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
and when we could not persuade him we ceased saying the will
of the lord be done
and after those days being prepared we went up to jerusalem
and there went also with us some of the disciples from caesarea
bringing with them one mnason a cyprian an old disciple with whom we
should lodge
and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us
gladly
and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all
the ancients were assembled
whom when he had saluted he related particularly what things god
had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry
but they hearing it glorified god and said to him thou seest
brother how many thousands there are among the jews that have believed
and they are all zealous for the law
now they have heard of thee that thou teachest those jews who
are among the gentiles to depart from moses saying that they ought not
to circumcise their children nor walk according to the custom
what is it therefore the multitude must needs come together for
they will hear that thou art come
do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men who have
a vow on them
take these and sanctify thyself with them and bestow on them
that they may shave their heads and all will know that the things which
they have heard of these are false but that thou thyself also walkest
keeping the law
time observed by the christian jews to bury as it were the synagogue
with honour
but as touching the gentiles that believe we have written
decreeing that they should only refrain themselves from that which has
been offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from
fornication
then paul took the men and the next day being purified with
them entered into the temple giving notice of the accomplishment of
the days of purification until an oblation should be offered for every
one of them
but when the seven days were drawing to an end those jews that
were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people
and laid hands upon him crying out
men of israel help this is the man that teacheth all men every
where against the people and the law and this place and moreover hath
brought in gentiles into the temple and hath violated this holy place
for they had seen trophimus the ephesian in the city with him
whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple
and he whole city was in an uproar and the people ran together
doors were shut
and as they went about to kill him it was told the tribune of
the band that all jerusalem was in confusion
who forthwith taking with him soldiers and centurions ran down
to them and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they left off
beating paul
then the tribune coming near took him and commanded him to be
bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he had done
and some cried one thing some another among the multitude and
when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him to
be carried into the castle
and when he was come to the stairs it fell out that he was
carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the people
for the multitude of the people followed after crying away with
him
and as paul was about to be brought into the castle he saith to
the tribune may i speak something to thee who said canst thou speak
art not thou that egyptian who before these days didst raise a
tumult and didst lead forth into the desert four thousand men that were
murderers
but paul said to him i am a jew of tarsus in cilicia a citizen
of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak to the people
and when he had given him leave paul standing on the stairs
beckoned with his hand to the people and a great silence being made he
spoke unto them in the hebrew tongue saying
scourging by claiming the privilege of a roman citizen
men brethren and fathers hear ye the account which i now give
unto you
and when they heard that he spoke to them in the hebrew tongue
they kept the more silence
and he saith i am a jew born at tarsus in cilicia but brought
up in this city at the feet of gamaliel taught according to the truth
of the law of the fathers zealous for the law as also all you are this
day
who persecuted this way unto death binding and delivering into
prisons both men and women
as the high priest doth bear me witness and all the ancients from
whom also receiving letters to the brethren i went to damascus that i
might bring them bound from thence to jerusalem to be punished
and it came to pass as i was going and drawing nigh to damascus
at midday that suddenly from heaven there shone round about me a great
light
and falling on the ground i heard a voice saying to me saul
and i answered who art thou lord and he said to me i am jesus
of nazareth whom thou persecutest
and they that were with me saw indeed the light but they heard
not the voice of him that spoke with me
they heard the voice acts
and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said to me arise
and go to damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things that
thou must do
and whereas i did not see for the brightness of that light being
led by the hand by my companions i came to damascus
and one ananias a man according to the law having testimony of
all the jews who dwelt there
coming to me and standing by me said to me brother saul look
up and i the same hour looked upon him
but he said the god of our fathers hath preordained thee that
thou shouldst know his will and see the just one and shouldst hear the
voice from his mouth
for thou shalt be his witness to all men of those things which
thou hast seen and heard
and now why tarriest thou rise up and be baptized and wash away
thy sins invoking his name
and it came to pass when i was come again to jerusalem and was
praying in the temple that i was in a trance
and saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out
of jerusalem because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me
and i said lord they know that i cast into prison and beat in
every synagogue them that believed in thee
and when the blood of stephen thy witness was shed i stood by
and consented and kept the garments of them that killed him
and he said to me go for unto the gentiles afar off will i send
thee
and they heard him until this word and then lifted up their
voice saying away with such an one from the earth for it is not fit
that he should live
and as they cried out and threw off their garments and cast dust
into the air
the tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle and that
he should be scourged and tortured to know for what cause they did so
cry out against him
and when they had bound him with thongs paul saith to the
centurion that stood by him is it lawful for you to scourge a man that
is a roman and uncondemned
which the centurion hearing went to the tribune and told him
saying what art thou about to do for this man is a roman citizen
and the tribune coming said to him tell me art thou a roman
and the tribune answered i obtained the being free of this city
with a great sum and paul said but i was born so
immediately therefore they departed from him that were about to
torture him the tribune also was afraid after he understood that he was
a roman citizen and because he had bound him
but on the next day meaning to know more diligently for what
cause he was accused by the jews he loosed him and commanded the
priests to come together and all the council and bringing forth paul
he set him before them
away to cesarea
and paul looking upon the council said men brethren i have
conversed with all good conscience before god until this present day
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to
strike him on the mouth
then paul said to him god shall strike thee thou whited wall
law commandest me to be struck
and they that stood by said dost thou revile the high priest of
and paul said i knew not brethren that he is the high priest
people
and paul knowing that the one part were sadducees and the other
son of pharisees concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead i am
called in question
and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither
angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both
and there arose a great cry and some of the pharisees rising up
strove saying we find no evil in this man what if a spirit hath
spoken to him or an angel
and when there arose a great dissension the tribune fearing
lest paul should be pulled in pieces by them commanded the soldiers to
go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into
the castle
and the night following the lord standing by him said be
constant for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou
bear witness also at rome
and when day was come some of the jews gathered together and
bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor
drink till they killed paul
and they were more than forty men that had made this conspiracy
who came to the chief priests and the ancients and said we have
bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing till we
have slain paul
now therefore do you with the council signify to the tribune
that he bring him forth to you as if you meant to know something more
certain touching him and we before he come near are ready to kill
him
which when pauls sisters son had heard of their lying in wait
he came and entered into the castle and told paul
and paul calling to him one of the centurions said bring this
young man to the tribune for he hath some thing to tell him
and he taking him brought him to the tribune and said paul
the prisoner desired me to bring this young man unto thee who hath
some thing to say to thee
and the tribune taking him by the hand went aside with him
privately and asked him what is it that thou hast to tell me
and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
wouldst bring forth paul tomorrow into the council as if they meant to
inquire some thing more certain touching him
but do not thou give credit to them for there lie in wait for
him more than forty men of them who have bound themselves by oath
neither to eat nor to drink till they have killed him and they are
now ready looking for a promise from thee
the tribune therefore dismissed the young man charging him that
he should tell no man that he had made known these things unto him
then having called two centurions he said to them make ready
two hundred soldiers to go as far as caesarea and seventy horsemen and
two hundred spearmen for the third hour of the night
and provide beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe
to felix the governor
for he feared lest perhaps the jews might take him away by force
and kill him and he should afterwards be slandered as if he was to
take money and he wrote a letter after this manner
claudius lysias to the most excellent governor felix greeting
this man being taken by the jews and ready to be killed by them
and meaning to know the cause which they objected unto him i
brought him forth into their council
whom i found to be accused concerning questions of their law but
having nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bands
and when i was told of ambushes that they had prepared for him i
sent him to thee signifying also to his accusers to plead before thee
then the soldiers according as it was commanded them taking
and the next day leaving the horsemen to go with him they
returned to the castle
who when they were come to caesarea and had delivered the letter
to the governor did also present paul before him
and when he had read it and had asked of what province he was and
understood that he was of cilicia
i will hear thee said he when thy accusers come and he
commanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall
faith to him
and after five days the high priest ananias came down with some
ancients and one tertullus an orator who went to the governor against
and paul being called for tertullus began to accuse him saying
rectified by thy providence
we accept it always and in all places most excellent felix with
all thanksgiving
but that i be no further tedious to thee i desire thee of thy
clemency to hear us in a few words
we have found this to be a pestilent man and raising seditions
among all the jews throughout the world and author of the sedition of
the sect of the nazarenes
who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we having
apprehended would also have judged according to our law
but lysias the tribune coming upon us with great violence took
him away out of our hands
commanding his accusers to come to thee of whom thou mayest
thyself by examination have knowledge of all these things whereof we
accuse him
and the jews also added and said that these things were so
then paul answered the governor making a sign to him to speak
will with good courage answer for myself
for thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days
since i went up to adore in jerusalem
and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man
or causing any concourse of the people neither in the synagogues nor
in the city
neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now
accuse me
but this i confess to thee that according to the way which they
call a heresy so do i serve the father and my god believing all things
which are written in the law and the prophets
having hope in god which these also themselves look for that
there shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust
and herein do i endeavour to have always a conscience without
offence towards god and towards men
now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and
offerings and vows
in which i was found purified in the temple neither with
multitude nor with tumult
but certain jews of asia who ought to be present before thee and
to accuse if they had anything against me
or let these men themselves say if they found in me any iniquity
when standing before the council
except it be for this one voice only that i cried standing among
them concerning the resurrection of the dead am i judged this day by
you
and felix put them off having most certain knowledge of this
way saying when lysias the tribune shall come down i will hear you
and he commanded a centurion to keep him and that he should be
easy and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto
him
and after some days felix coming with drusilla his wife who
was a jew sent for paul and heard of him the faith that is in christ
and as he treated of justice and chastity and of the judgment to
come felix being terrified answered for this time go thy way but
when i have a convenient time i will send for thee
hoping also withal that money should be given him by paul for
which cause also oftentimes sending for him he spoke with him
but when two years were ended felix had for successor portius
bound
now when festus was come into the province after three days he
went up to jerusalem from cesarea
and the chief priests and principal men of the jews went unto him
against paul and they besought him
requesting favour against him that he would command him to be
brought to jerusalem laying wait to kill him in the way
but festus answered that paul was kept in caesarea and that he
himself would very shortly depart thither
let them therefore saith he among you that are able go down
with me and accuse him if there be any crime in the man
and having tarried among them no more than eight or ten days he
went down to caesarea and the next day he sat in the judgment seat and
commanded paul to be brought
who being brought the jews stood about him who were come down
from jerusalem objecting many and grievious causes which they could
not prove
paul making answer for himself neither against the law of the
thing
but festus willing to shew the jews a pleasure answering paul
said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things
before me
then paul said i stand at caesars judgment seat where i ought
to be judged to the jews i have done no injury as thou very well
knowest
for if i have injured them or have committed any thing worthy of
death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof
they accuse me no man may deliver me to them i appeal to caesar
then festus having conferred with the council answered hast
thou appealed to caesar to caesar shalt thou go
and after some days king agrippa and bernice came down to
and as they tarried there many days festus told the king of
about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the
ancients of the jews came unto me desiring condemnation against him
to whom i answered it is not the custom of the romans to condemn
any man before that he who is accused have his accusers present and
have liberty to make his answer to clear himself of the things laid to
his charge
when therefore they were come hither without any delay on the
day following sitting in the judgment seat i commanded the man to be
brought
against whom when the accusers stood up they brought no
accusation of this which i thought ill of
but had certain questions of their own superstition against him
and of one jesus deceased whom paul affirmed to be alive
i therefore being in a doubt of this manner of question asked
him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these
things
but paul appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus
and agrippa said to festus i would also hear the man myself
and on the next day when agrippa and bernice were come with
great pomp and had entered into the hall of audience with the tribunes
and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought
forth
and festus saith king agrippa and all ye men who are here
present with us you see this man about whom all the multitude of the
not to live any longer
yet have i found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death
to send him
of whom i have nothing certain to write to my lord for which
cause i have brought him forth before you and especially before thee
for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to
signify the things laid to his charge
then agrippa said to paul thou art permitted to speak for
thyself then paul stretching forth his hand began to make his answer
i think myself happy o king agrippa that i am to answer for
myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am
accused by the jews
especially as thou knowest all both customs and questions that
are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently
and my life indeed from my youth which was from the beginning
among my own nation in jerusalem all the jews do know
having known me from the beginning if they will give testimony
that according to the most sure sect of our religion i lived a
and now for the hope of the promise that was made by god to the
fathers do i stand subject to judgment
unto which our twelve tribes serving night and day hope to
come for which hope o king i am accused by the jews
why should it be thought a thing incredible that god should raise
the dead
and i indeed did formerly think that i ought to do many things
contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth
which also i did at jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut
up in prison having received authority of the chief priests and when
they were put to death i brought the sentence
and oftentimes punishing them in every synagogue i compelled
them to blaspheme and being yet more mad against them i persecuted
them even unto foreign cities
whereupon when i was going to damascus with authority and
permission of the chief priest
at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above
the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them that were in
company with me
and when we were all fallen down on the ground i heard a voice
speaking to me in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou
me it is hard for thee to kick against the good
and i said who art thou lord and the lord answered i am jesus
whom thou persecutest
but rise up and stand upon thy feet for to this end have i
appeared to thee that i may make thee a minister and a witness of those
things which thou hast seen and of those things wherein i will appear to
thee
delivering thee from the people and from the nations unto which
now i send thee
to open their eyes that they may be converted from darkness to
light and from the power of satan to god that they may receive
forgiveness of sins and a lot among the saints by the faith that is in
me
whereupon o king agrippa i was not incredulous to the heavenly
vision
but to them first that are at damascus and at jerusalem and unto
all the country of judea and to the gentiles did i preach that they
should do penance and turn to god doing works worthy of penance
for this cause the jews when i was in the temple having
apprehended me went about to kill me
but being aided by the help of god i stand unto this day
witnessing both to small and great saying no other thing than those
which the prophets and moses did say should come to pass
that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that
should rise from the dead and should shew light to the people and to the
as he spoke these things and made his answer festus said with a
loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee
mad
and paul said i am not mad most excellent festus but i speak
words of truth and soberness
for the king knoweth of these things to whom also i speak with
confidence for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from
him for neither was any of these things done in a corner
believest thou the prophets o king agrippa i know that thou
believest
and agrippa said to paul in a little thou persuadest me to
become a christian
and paul said i would to god that both in a little and in much
not only thou but also all that hear me this day should become such as
and the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that
sat with them
and when they were gone aside they spoke among themselves
saying this man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands
and agrippa said to festus this man might have been set at
liberty if he had not appealed to caesar
and when it was determined that he should sail into italy and that
named julius of the band augusta
going on board a ship of adrumetum we launched meaning to sail
by the coasts of asia aristarchus the macedonian of thessalonica
continuing with us
and the day following we came to sidon and julius treating paul
courteously permitted him to go to his friends and to take care of
himself
and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus
because the winds were contrary
and sailing over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to
and there the centurion finding a ship of alexandria sailing
into italy removed us into it
and when for many days we had sailed slowly and were scarce come
over against gnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed near crete by
and with much ado sailing by it we came into a certain place
which is called goodhavens nigh to which was the city of thalassa
and when much time was spent and when sailing now was dangerous
because the fast was now past paul comforted them
saying to them ye men i see that the voyage beginneth to be
with injury and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also
of our lives
but the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship
more than those things which were said by paul
and whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in the
greatest part gave counsel to sail thence if by any means they might
reach phenice to winter there which is a haven of crete looking
towards the southwest and northwest
and the south wind gently blowing thinking that they had
obtained their purpose when they had loosed from asson they sailed
close by crete
but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind
called euroaquilo
and when the ship was caught and could not bear up against the
wind giving up the ship to the winds we were driven
and running under a certain island that is called cauda we had
much work to come by the boat
which being taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and
fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands they let down the
sail yard and so were driven
and we being mightily tossed with the tempest the next day they
lightened the ship
and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tacking
of the ship
and when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no
small storms lay on us all hope of our being saved was now taken away
and after they had fasted a long time paul standing forth in the
midst of them said you should indeed o ye men have hearkened unto me
and not have loosed from crete and have gained this harm and loss
and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no
loss of any mans life among you but only of the ship
for an angel of god whose i am and whom i serve stood by me
this night
saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and
behold god hath given thee all them that sail with thee
wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it
shall so be as it hath been told me
and we must come unto a certain island
but after the fourteenth night was come as we were sailing in
country
who also sounding found twenty fathoms and going on a little
further they found fifteen fathoms
then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places they cast
four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day
but as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship having let down
the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have cast
anchors out of the forepart of the ship
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these stay
in the ship you cannot be saved
then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall
off
and when it began to be light paul besought them all to take
meat saying this day is the fourteenth day that you have waited and
continued fasting taking nothing
wherefore i pray you to take some meat for your healths sake
for there shall not an hair of the head of any of you perish
and when he had said these things taking bread he gave thanks
to god in the sight of them all and when he had broken it he began to
eat
then were they all of better cheer and they also took some meat
and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen
souls
and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship casting
the wheat into the sea
and when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered
a certain creek that had a shore into which they minded if they could
to thrust in the ship
and when they had taken up the anchors they committed themselves
to the sea loosing withal the rudder bands and hoisting up the
mainsail to the wind they made towards shore
and when we were fallen into a place where two seas met they run
the ship aground and the forepart indeed sticking fast remained
unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the sea
and the soldiers counsel was that they should kill the
prisoners lest any of them swimming out should escape
but the centurion willing to save paul forbade it to be done
into the sea and save themselves and get to land
and the rest some they carried on boards and some on those
things that belonged to the ship and so it came to pass that every soul
got safe to land
arrives at rome his conference there with the jews
and when we had escaped then we knew that the island was called
for kindling a fire they refreshed us all because of the present
rain and of the cold
and when paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks and had
laid them on the fire a viper coming out of the heat fastened on his
hand
and when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his hand they
said one to another undoubtedly this man is a murderer who though he
hath escaped the sea yet vengeance doth not suffer him to live
and he indeed shaking off the beast into the fire suffered no
harm
but they supposed that he would begin to swell up and that he
would suddenly fall down and die but expecting long and seeing that
there came no harm to him changing their minds they said that he was a
god
now in these places were possessions of the chief man of the
island named publius who receiving us for three days entertained us
courteously
and it happened that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and
of a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and when he had prayed and
laid his hands on him he healed him
which being done all that had diseases in the island came and
were healed
who also honoured us with many honours and when we were to set
sail they laded us with such things as were necessary
and after three months we sailed in a ship of alexandria that
had wintered in the island whose sign was the castors
and when we were come to syracusa we tarried there three days
from thence compassing by the shore we came to rhegium and
after one day the south wind blowing we came the second day to
where finding brethren we were desired to tarry with them seven
days and so we went to rome
and from thence when the brethren had heard of us they came to
meet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns whom when paul
saw he gave thanks to god and took courage
and when we were come to rome paul was suffered to dwell by
himself with a soldier that kept him
and after the third day he called together the chief of the
having done nothing against the people or the custom of our fathers was
delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans
who when they had examined me would have released me for that
there was no cause of death in me
but the jews contradicting it i was constrained to appeal unto
for this cause therefore i desired to see you and to speak to
you because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain
but they said to him we neither received letters concerning thee
from judea neither did any of the brethren that came hither relate or
speak any evil of thee
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as
concerning this sect we know that it is every where contradicted
and when they had appointed him a day there came very many to
him unto his lodgings to whom he expounded testifying the kingdom of
the prophets from morning until evening
and some believed the things that were said but some believed
not
and when they agreed not among themselves they departed paul
speaking this one word well did the holy ghost speak to our fathers by
saying go to this people and say to them with the ear you shall
hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not
perceive
for the heart of this people is grown gross and with their ears
have they heard heavily and their eyes they have shut lest perhaps they
should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with
their heart and should be converted and i should heal them
be it known therefore to you that this salvation of god is sent
to the gentiles and they will hear it
and when he had said these things the jews went out from him
having much reasoning among themselves
and he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging and he
received all that came in to him
preaching the kingdom of god and teaching the things which
concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence without prohibition
twentyfour years after our lords ascension it was written in greek
but at the same time translated into latin for the benefit of those who
did not understand that language and though it is not the first of his
sublimity of the matter contained in it of the preeminence of the place
to which it was sent and in veneration of the church
