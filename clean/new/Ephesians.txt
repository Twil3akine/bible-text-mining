all the church
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to all the
saints who are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus
grace be to you and peace from god the father and from the lord
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath
blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ
as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we
should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity
who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of children through
unto the praise of the glory of his grace in which he hath graced
us in his beloved son
in whom we have redemption through his blood the remission of
sins according to the riches of his grace
which hath superabounded in us in all wisdom and prudence
that he might make known unto us the mystery of his will according
to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in him
in the dispensation of the fulness of times to reestablish all
things in christ that are in heaven and on earth in him
in whom we also are called by lot being predestinated according
to the purpose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of
his will
that we may be unto the praise of his glory we who before hoped
in christ
in whom you also after you had heard the word of truth the
gospel of your salvation in whom also believing you were signed with
the holy spirit of promise
who is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of
acquisition unto the praise of his glory
wherefore i also hearing of your faith that is in the lord jesus
and of your love towards all the saints
cease not to give thanks for you making commemoration of you in
my prayers
that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may
give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge
of him
the eyes of your heart enlightened that you may know what the hope
is of his calling and what are the riches of the glory of his
inheritance in the saints
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us who
believe according to the operation of the might of his power
which he wrought in christ raising him up from the dead and
setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places
above all principality and power and virtue and dominion and every
name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to
come
and he hath subjected all things under his feet and hath made him
head over all the church
which is his body and the fulness of him who is filled all in all
and you when you were dead in your offences and sins
wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this
world according to the prince of the power of this air of the spirit
that now worketh on the children of unbelief
in which also we all conversed in time past in the desires of our
flesh fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts and were by
nature children of wrath even as the rest
but god who is rich in mercy for his exceeding charity wherewith
he loved us
even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together in
and hath raised us up together and hath made us sit together in the
heavenly places through christ jesus
that he might shew in the ages to come the abundant riches of his
grace in his bounty towards us in christ jesus
for by grace you are saved through faith and that not of
yourselves for it is the gift of god
not of works that no man may glory
grace of god
for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus in good works
which god hath prepared that we should walk in them
for which cause be mindful that you being heretofore gentiles is
the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called
circumcision in the flesh made by hands
that you were at that time without christ being aliens from the
conversation of israel and strangers to the testament having no hope of
the promise and without god in this world
but now in christ jesus you who some time were afar off are
made nigh by the blood of christ
for he is our peace who hath made both one and breaking down the
middle wall of partition the enmities in his flesh
making void the law of commandments contained in decrees that he
might make the two in himself into one new man making peace
and might reconcile both to god in one body by the cross killing
the enmities in himself
and coming he preached peace to you that were afar off and peace
to them that were nigh
for by him we have access both in one spirit to the father
now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but you
are fellow citizens with the saints and the domestics of god
built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus
in whom all the building being framed together groweth up into
an holy temple in the lord
in whom you also are built together into an habitation of god in
the spirit
imparted to the gentiles he prays that they may be strengthened in god
for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you
if yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which
is given me towards you
how that according to revelation the mystery has been made known
to me as i have written above in a few words
as you reading may understand my knowledge in the mystery of
which in other generations was not known to the sons of men as it
is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the spirit
that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and
copartners of his promise in christ jesus by the gospel
of which i am made a minister according to the gift of the grace
of god which is given to me according to the operation of his power
to me the least of all the saints is given this grace to preach
among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ
and to enlighten all men that they may see what is the
dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in god
who created all things
that the manifold wisdom of god may be made known to the
principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church
according to the eternal purpose which he made in christ jesus our
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith
of him
wherefore i pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you
which is your glory
for this cause i bow my knees to the father of our lord jesus
of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named
and men whosoever besides is named father is so named with
subordination to him
that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to
be strengthened by his spirit with might unto the inward man
that christ may dwell by faith in your hearts that being rooted
and founded in charity
you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth
to know also the charity of christ which surpasseth all
knowledge that you may be filled unto all the fulness of god
now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we
desire or understand according to the power that worketh in us
to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus unto all
generations world without end amen
i therefore a prisoner in the lord beseech you that you walk
worthy of the vocation in which you are called
with all humility and mildness with patience supporting one
another in charity
careful to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
one body and one spirit as you are called in one hope of your
calling
one lord one faith one baptism
one god and father of all who is above all and through all and
in us all
but to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of
the giving of christ
wherefore he saith ascending on high he led captivity captive he
gave gifts to men
now that he ascended what is it but because he also descended
first into the lower parts of the earth
he that descended is the same also that ascended above all the
heavens that he might fill all things
and he gave some apostles and some prophets and other some
evangelists and other some pastors and doctors
expressed that christ has left in his church a perpetual succession of
orthodox pastors and teachers to preserve the faithful in unity and
truth
for the perfecting of the saints for the word of the ministry
for the edifying of the body of christ
until we all meet into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of
the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the age of the
fulness of christ
that henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro and
carried about with every wind of doctrine by the wickedness of men by
cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive
but doing the truth in charity we may in all things grow up in
him who is the head even christ
from whom the whole body being compacted and fitly joined
together by what every joint supplieth according to the operation in
the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the
edifying of itself in charity
this then i say and testify in the lord that henceforward you
walk not as also the gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind
having their understanding darkened being alienated from the life
of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness
of their hearts
who despairing have given themselves up to lasciviousness unto
the working of all uncleanness unto covetousness
but you have not so learned christ
if so be that you have heard him and have been taught in him as
the truth is in jesus
to put off according to former conversation the old man who is
corrupted according to the desire of error
and be renewed in spirit of your mind
and put on the new man who according to god is created in justice
and holiness of truth
wherefore putting away lying speak ye the truth every man with
his neighbour for we are members one of another
be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your anger
give not place to the devil
he that stole let him now steal no more but rather let him
labour working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have
something to give to him that suffereth need
let no evil speech proceed from your mouth but that which is
good to the edification of faith that it may administer grace to the
hearers
and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto
the day of redemption
let all bitterness and anger and indignation and clamour and
blasphemy be put away from you with all malice
and be ye kind one to another merciful forgiving one another
even as god hath forgiven you in christ
the example of christ and of the church
be ye therefore followers of god as most dear children
and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath delivered
himself for us an oblation and a sacrifice to god for an odour of
sweetness
but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not so
much as be named among you as becometh saints
or obscenity or foolish talking or scurrility which is to no
purpose but rather giving of thanks
for know you this and understand that no fornicator or unclean or
covetous person which is a serving of idols hath inheritance in the
kingdom of christ and of god
let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things
cometh the anger of god upon the children of unbelief
be ye not therefore partakers with them
for you were heretofore darkness but now light in the lord walk
then as children of the light
for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and
truth
proving what is well pleasing to god
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but
rather reprove them
for the things that are done by them in secret it is a shame even
to speak of
but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light
for all that is made manifest is light
wherefore he saith rise thou that sleepest and arise from the
dead and christ shall enlighten thee
see therefore brethren how you walk circumspectly not as
unwise
but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil
wherefore become not unwise but understanding what is the will
of god
and be not drunk with wine wherein is luxury but be ye filled
with the holy spirit
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
canticles singing and making melody in your hearts to the lord
giving thanks always for all things in the name of our lord jesus
being subject one to another in the fear of christ
let women be subject to their husbands as to the lord
because the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head
of the church he is the saviour of his body
therefore as the church is subject to christ so also let the
wives be to their husbands in all things
remain faithful to him unspotted and unchanged to the end of the world
husbands love your wives as christ also loved the church and
delivered himself up for it
that he might sanctify it cleansing it by the laver of water in
the word of life
that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having
spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and
without blemish
so also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he
that loveth his wife loveth himself
for no man ever hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth
it as also christ doth the church
because we are members of him body of his flesh and of his
bones
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall
cleave to his wife and they shall be two in one flesh
this is a great sacrament but i speak in christ and in the
church
nevertheless let every one of you in particular love for his wife
as himself and let the wife fear her husband
children obey your parents in the lord for this is just
honour thy father and thy mother which is the first commandment
with a promise
that it may be well with thee and thou mayest be long lived upon
earth
and you fathers provoke not your children to anger but bring
them up in the discipline and correction of the lord
servants be obedient to them that are your lords according to the
flesh with fear and trembling in the simplicity of your heart as to
not serving to the eye as it were pleasing men but as the
servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart
with a good will serving as to the lord and not to men
knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do the same shall
he receive from the lord whether he be bond or free
and you masters do the same things to them forbearing
threatenings knowing that the lord both of them and you is in heaven
finally brethren be strengthened in the lord and in the might of
his power
put you on the armour of god that you may be able to stand
against the deceits of the devil
for our wrestling is not against flesh and blood but against
principalities and powers against the rulers of the world of this
darkness against the spirits of wickedness in the high places
lowest of the celestial regions in which god permits these wicked
spirits or fallen angels to wander
therefore take unto you the armour of god that you may be able
to resist in the evil day and to stand in all things perfect
stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and
having on the breastplate of justice
and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace
in all things taking the shield of faith wherewith you may be
able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one
and take unto you the helmet of salvation and the sword of the
by all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit
and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for all the
saints
and for me that speech may be given me that i may open my mouth
with confidence to make known the mystery of the gospel
for which i am an ambassador in a chain so that therein i may be
bold to speak according as i ought
but that you also may know the things that concern me and what i
am doing tychicus my dearest brother and faithful minister in the
whom i have sent to you for this same purpose that you may know
the things concerning us and that he may comfort your hearts
peace be to the brethren and charity with faith from god the
grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in
incorruption amen
faith they had a great veneration for st paul and supplied his wants
when he was a prisoner in rome sending to him by epaphroditus by whom
he sent this epistle in which he recommends charity unity and humility
and warns them against false teachers whom he calls dogs and enemies of
the cross of christ he also returns thanks for their benefactions it
was written about twentynine years after our lords ascension
