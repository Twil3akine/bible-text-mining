his disciples and works many miracles
the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god
as it is written in isaias the prophet behold i send my angel
before thy face who shall prepare the way before thee
a voice of one crying in the desert prepare ye the way of the
john was in the desert baptizing and preaching the baptism of
penance unto remission of sins
and there went out to him all the country of judea and all they of
their sins
and john was clothed camels hair and a leathern girdle about his
loins and he ate locusts and wild honey
and he preached saying there cometh after me one mightier than i
the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and loose
i have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the
and it came to pass in those days jesus came from nazareth of
and forthwith coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open
and the spirit as a dove descending and remaining on him
and there came a voice from heaven thou art my beloved son in
thee i am well pleased
and immediately the spirit drove him out into the desert
and he was in the desert forty days and forty nights and was
tempted by satan and he was with beasts and the angels ministered to
him
and after that john was delivered up jesus came in galilee
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god
and saying the time is accomplished and the kingdom of god is at
hand repent and believe the gospel
and passing by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew his
brother casting nets into the sea for they were fishermen
and jesus said to them come after me and i will make you to
become fishers of men
and immediately leaving their nets they followed him
and going on from thence a little farther he saw james the son of
ship
and forthwith he called them and leaving their father zebedee in
the ship with his hired men they followed him
and they entered into capharnaum and forthwith upon the sabbath
days going into the synagogue he taught them
and they were astonished at his doctrine for he was teaching them
as one having power and not as the scribes
and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and
he cried out
saying what have we to do with thee jesus of nazareth art thou
come to destroy us i know who thou art the holy one of god
and jesus threatened him saying speak no more and go out of the
man
and the unclean spirit tearing him and crying out with a loud
voice went out of him
and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among
themselves saying what thing is this what is this new doctrine for
with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits and they obey him
and the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of
and immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the
house of simon and andrew with james and john
and simons wifes mother lay in a fit of a fever and forthwith
they tell him of her
and coming to her he lifted her up taking her by the hand and
immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them
and when it was evening after sunset they brought to him all
that were ill and that were possessed with devils
and all the city was gathered together at the door
and he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases and
he cast out many devils and he suffered them not to speak because they
knew him
and rising very early going out he went into a desert place and
there he prayed
and simon and they that were with him followed after him
and when they had found him they said to him all seek for thee
and he saith to them let us go into the neighbouring towns and
cities that i may preach there also for to this purpose am i come
and he was preaching in their synagogues and in all galilee and
casting out devils
and there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down
said to him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and jesus having compassion on him stretched forth his hand and
touching him saith to him i will be thou made clean
and when he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him
and he was made clean
and he strictly charged him and forthwith sent him away
and he saith to him see thou tell no one but go shew thyself to
the high priest and offer for thy cleansing the things that moses
commanded for a testimony to them
but he being gone out began to publish and to blaze abroad the
word so that he could not openly go into the city but was without in
desert places and they flocked to him from all sides
disciples
and again he entered into capharnaum after some days
and it was heard that he was in the house and many came together
so that there was no room no not even at the door and he spoke to
them the word
and they came to him bringing one sick of the palsy who was
carried by four
and when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude they
uncovered the roof where he was and opening it they let down the bed
wherein the man sick of the palsy lay
and when jesus had seen their faith he saith to the sick of the
palsy son thy sins are forgiven thee
and there were some of the scribes sitting there and thinking in
their hearts
why doth this man speak thus he blasphemeth who can forgive sins
but god only
which jesus presently knowing in his spirit that they so thought
within themselves saith to them why think you these things in your
hearts
which is easier to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins are
forgiven thee or to say arise take up thy bed and walk
but that you may know that the son of man hath power on earth to
forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy
i say to thee arise take up thy bed and go into thy house
and immediately he arose and taking up his bed went his way in
the sight of all so that all wondered and glorified god saying we
never saw the like
and he went forth again to the sea side and all the multitude
came to him and he taught them
and when he was passing by he saw levi the son of alpheus
sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith to him follow me and
rising up he followed him
and it came to pass as he sat at meat in his house many publicans
and sinners sat down together with jesus and his disciples for they
with jesus who also followed him for they were many who also followed
him
and the scribes and the pharisees seeing that he ate with
publicans and sinners said to his disciples why doth your master eat
and drink with publicans and sinners
jesus hearing this saith to them they that are well have no need
of a physician but they that are sick for i came not to call the just
but sinners
and the disciples of john and the pharisees used to fast and
they come and say to him why do the disciples of john and of the
and jesus saith to them can the children of the marriage fast as
long as the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom
with them they cannot fast
but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them and then they shall fast in those days
no man seweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment otherwise
the new piecing taketh away from the old and there is made a greater
rent
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles otherwise the wine
will burst the bottles and both the wine will be spilled and the
bottles will be lost but new wine must be put into new bottles
and it came to pass again as the lord walked through the corn
fields on the sabbath that his disciples began to go forward and to
pluck the ears of corn
and the pharisees said to him behold why do they on the sabbath
day that which is not lawful
and he said to them have you never read what david did when he
had need and was hungry himself and they that were with him
how he went into the house of god under abiathar the high priest
and did eat the loaves of proposition which was not lawful to eat but
for the priests and gave to them who were with him
and he said to them the sabbath was made for man and not man for
the sabbath
therefore the son of man is lord of the sabbath also
blasphemy of the pharisees
and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there
who had a withered hand
and they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days
that they might accuse him
and he said to the man who had the withered hand stand up in the
midst
and he saith to them is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days
or to do evil to save life or to destroy but they held their peace
and looking round about on them with anger being grieved for the
blindness of their hearts he saith to the man stretch forth thy hand
and the pharisees going out immediately made a consultation with
the herodians against him how they might destroy him
but jesus retired with his disciples to the sea and a great
multitude followed him from galilee and judea
and from jerusalem and from idumea and from beyond the jordan and
they about tyre and sidon a great multitude hearing the things which
he did came to him
and he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him
because of the multitude lest they should throng him
for he healed many so that they pressed upon him for to touch
him as many as had evils
and the unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him
and they cried saying
thou art the son of god and he strictly charged them that they
should not make him known
and going up into a mountain he called unto him whom he would
himself and they came to him
and he made that twelve should be with him and that he might send
them to preach
and he gave them power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils
and to simon he gave the name peter
and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and
he named them boanerges which is the sons of thunder
and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and
and judas iscariot who also betrayed him
and they come to a house and the multitude cometh together again
so that they could not so much as eat bread
and when his friends had heard of it they went out to lay hold on
him for they said he is become mad
and the scribes who were come down from jerusalem said he hath
and after he had called them together he said to them in
parables how can satan cast out satan
and if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot
stand
and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand
and if satan be risen up against himself he is divided and
cannot stand but hath an end
no man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his
goods unless he first bind the strong man and then shall he plunder
his house
amen i say to you that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of
men and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme
but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost shall never
have forgiveness but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin
because they said he hath an unclean spirit
and his mother and his brethren came and standing without sent
unto him calling him
and the multitude sat about him and they say to him behold thy
mother and thy brethren without seek for thee
and answering them he said who is my mother and my brethren
and looking round about on them who sat about him he saith
for whosoever shall do the will of god he is my brother and my
sister and mother
and again he began to teach by the sea side and a great multitude
was gathered together unto him so that he went up into a ship and sat
in the sea and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side
and he taught them many things in parables and said unto them in
his doctrine
hear ye behold the sower went out to sow
and whilst he sowed some fell by the way side and the birds of
the air came and ate it up
and other some fell upon stony ground where it had not much earth
and it shot up immediately because it had no depth of earth
and when the sun was risen it was scorched and because it had no
root it withered away
and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it
and it yielded no fruit
and some fell upon good ground and brought forth fruit that grew
up and increased and yielded one thirty another sixty and another a
hundred
and he said he that hath ears to hear let him hear
and when he was alone the twelve that were with him asked him the
parable
and he said to them to you it is given to know the mystery of the
kingdom of god but to them that are without all things are done in
parables
that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may
hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and
their sins should be forgiven them
shutting their eyes st matt god justly withdrew those
lights and graces which otherwise he would have given them for their
effectual conversion
and he saith to them are you ignorant of this parable and how
shall you know all parables
he that soweth soweth the word
and these are they by the way side where the word is sown and as
soon as they have heard immediately satan cometh and taketh away the
word that was sown in their hearts
and these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground who
when they have heard the word immediately receive it with joy
and they have no root in themselves but are only for a time and
then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are
presently scandalized
and others there are who are sown among thorns these are they
that hear the word
and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and
the lusts after other things entering in choke the word and it is made
fruitless
and these are they who are sown upon the good ground who hear the
word and receive it and yield fruit the one thirty another sixty
and another a hundred
and he said to them doth a candle come in to be put under a
bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick
for there is nothing hid which shall not be made manifest
neither was it made secret but that it may come abroad
if any man have ears to hear let him hear
and he said to them take heed what you hear in what measure you
shall mete it shall be measured to you again and more shall be given
to you
for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not
that also which he hath shall be taken away from him
and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast
seed into the earth
and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should
spring and grow up whilst he knoweth not
for the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit first the blade
then the ear afterwards the full corn in the ear
and when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the
sickle because the harvest is come
and he said to what shall we liken the kingdom of god or to what
parable shall we compare it
it is as a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the
earth is less than all the seeds that are in the earth
and when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all
herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the birds of the air may
dwell under the shadow thereof
and with many such parables he spoke to them the word according
as they were able to hear
and without parable he did not speak unto them but apart he
explained all things to his disciples
and he saith to them that day when evening was come let us pass
over to the other side
and sending away the multitude they take him even as he was in
the ship and there were other ships with him
and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the
ship so that the ship was filled
and he was in the hinder part of the ship sleeping upon a pillow
and they awake him and say to him master doth it not concern thee
that we perish
and rising up he rebuked the wind and said to the sea peace be
still and the wind ceased and there was made a great calm
and he said to them why are you fearful have you not faith yet
thinkest thou that both wind and sea obey him
raises the daughter of jairus to life
and they came over the strait of the sea into the country of the
and as he went out of the ship immediately there met him out of
the monuments a man with an unclean spirit
who had his dwelling in the tombs and no man now could bind him
not even with chains
for having been often bound with fetters and chains he had burst
the chains and broken the fetters in pieces and no one could tame him
and he was always day and night in the monuments and in the
mountains crying and cutting himself with stones
and seeing jesus afar off he ran and adored him
and crying with a loud voice he said what have i to do with thee
torment me not
for he said unto him go out of the man thou unclean spirit
and he asked him what is thy name and he saith to him my name is
and he besought him much that he would not drive him away out of
the country
and there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine
feeding
and the spirits besought him saying send us into the swine that
we may enter into them
and jesus immediately gave them leave and the unclean spirits
going out entered into the swine and the herd with great violence was
carried headlong into the sea being about two thousand were stifled in
the sea
and they that fed them fled and told it in the city and in the
fields and they went out to see what was done
and they came to jesus and they see him that was troubled with
the devil sitting clothed and well in his wits and they were afraid
and they that had seen it told them in what manner he had been
dealt with who had the devil and concerning the swine
and they began to pray him that he would depart from their coasts
and when he went up into the ship he that had been troubled with
the devil began to beseech him that he might be with him
and he admitted him not but saith him go into thy house to thy
friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and
hath had mercy thee
and he went his way and began to publish in decapolis how great
things jesus had done for him and all men wondered
and when jesus had passed again in the ship over the strait a
great multitude assembled together unto him and he was nigh unto the
sea
and there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue named jairus
and seeing him falleth down at his feet
and he besought him much saying my daughter is at the point of
death come lay thy hand upon her that she may be safe and may live
and he went with him and a great multitude followed him and they
thronged him
and a woman who was under an issue of blood twelve years
and had suffered many things from many physicians and had spent
all that she had and was nothing the better but rather worse
when she had heard of jesus came in the crowd behind him and
touched his garment
for she said if i shall touch but his garment i shall be whole
and forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt
in her body that she was healed of the evil
and immediately jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had
proceeded from him turning to the multitude said who hath touched my
garments
and his disciples said to him thou seest the multitude thronging
thee and sayest thou who hath touched me
and he looked about to see her who had done this
but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her
came and fell down before him and told him all the truth
and he said to her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go
in peace and be thou whole of thy disease
while he was yet speaking some come from the ruler of the
synagogues house saying thy daughter is dead why dost thou trouble
the master any further
but jesus having heard the word that was spoken saith to the
ruler of the synagogue fear not only believe
and he admitted not any man to follow him but peter and james
and john the brother of james
and they cone to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and he
seeth a tumult and people weeping and wailing much
and going in he saith to them why make you this ado and weep
the damsel is not dead but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn but he having put them all out
taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with
him and entereth in where the damsel was lying
and taking the damsel by the hand he saith to her talitha cumi
which is being interpreted damsel i say to thee arise
and immediately the damsel rose up and walked and she was twelve
years old and they were astonished with a great astonishment
and he charged them strictly that no man should know it and
commanded that something should be given her to eat
five thousand with five loaves and walks upon the sea
and going out from thence he went into his own country and his
disciples followed him
and when the sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue
and many hearing him were in admiration at his doctrine saying how
came this man by all these things and what wisdom is this that is given
to him and such mighty works as are wrought by his hands
is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james
and joseph and jude and simon are not also his sisters here with us
and jesus said to them a prophet is not without honour but in his
own country and in his own house and among his own kindred
and he could not do any miracles there only that he cured a few
that were sick laying his hands upon them
miracles in favour of obstinate and incredulous people who were
unworthy of such favours
and he wondered because of their unbelief and he went through the
villages round about teaching
and he called the twelve and began to send them two and two and
gave them power over unclean spirits
and he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way
but a staff only no scrip no bread nor money in their purse
but to be shod with sandals and that they should not put on two
coats
and he said to them wheresoever you shall enter into an house
there abide till you depart from that place
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you going forth
from thence shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony to them
and going forth they preached men should do penance
and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that
were sick and healed them
and king herod heard for his name was made manifest and he
said john the baptist is risen again from dead and therefore mighty
works shew forth themselves in him
and others said it is elias but others said it is a prophet as
one of the prophets
which herod hearing said john whom i beheaded he is risen again
from the dead
for herod himself had sent and apprehended john and bound him
prison for the sake of herodias the wife of philip his brother because
he had married her
for john said to herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy
brothers wife
now herodias laid snares for him and was desirous to put him to
death and could not
for herod feared john knowing him to be a just and holy man and
kept him and when he heard him did many things and he heard him
willingly
the people would not put him to death though she sought it and
through her daughter she effected her wish
and when a convenient day was come herod made a supper for his
birthday for the princes and tribunes and chief men of galilee
and when the daughter of the same herodias had come in and had
danced and pleased herod and them that were at table with him the
king said to the damsel ask of me what thou wilt and i will give it
thee
and he swore to her whatsoever thou shalt ask i will give thee
though it be the half of my kingdom
who when she was gone out said to her mother what shall i ask
and when she was come in immediately with haste to the king she
asked saying i will that forthwith thou give me in a dish the head of
and the king was struck sad yet because of his oath and because
of them that were with him at table he would not displease her
but sending an executioner he commanded that his head should be
brought in a dish
and he beheaded him in the prison and brought his head in a dish
and gave to the damsel and the damsel gave it her mother
which his disciples hearing came and took his body and laid it
in a tomb
and the apostles coming together unto jesus related to him all
things that they had done and taught
and he said to them come apart into a desert place and rest a
little for there were many coming and going and they had not so much
as time to eat
and going up into a ship they went into a desert place apart
and they saw them going away and many knew and they ran flocking
thither foot from all the cities and were there before them
and jesus going out saw a great multitude and he had compassion
on them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began
to teach them many things
and when the day was now far spent his disciples came to him
saying this is a desert place and the hour is now past
send them away that going into the next villages and towns they
may buy themselves meat to eat
and he answering said to them give you them to eat and they said
to him let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence and we will give
them to eat
and he saith to them how many loaves have you go and see and
when they knew they say five and two fishes
and he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by
companies upon the green grass
and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties
and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes looking
up to heaven he blessed and broke the loaves and gave to his
disciples to set before them and the two fishes he divided among them
all
and they all did eat and had their fill
and they took up the leavings twelve full baskets of fragments
and of the fishes
and they that did eat were five thousand men
and immediately he obliged his disciples to go up into the ship
that they might go before him over the water to bethsaida whilst he
dismissed the people
and when he had dismissed them he went up to the mountain to
pray
and when it was late the ship was in the midst of the sea and
himself alone on the land
and seeing them labouring in rowing for the wind was against
them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them
walking upon the sea and he would have passed by them
but they seeing him walking upon the sea thought it was an
apparition and they cried out
for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately he
spoke with them and said to them have a good heart it is i fear ye
not
and he went up to them into the ship and the wind ceased and
they were far more astonished within themselves
for they understood not concerning the loaves for their heart was
blinded
and when they had passed over they came into the land of
and when they were gone out of the ship immediately they knew
him
and running through that whole country they began to carry about
in beds those that were sick where they heard he was
and whithersoever he entered into towns or into villages or
cities they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they
might touch but the hem of his garment and as many as touched him were
made whole
and there assembled together unto him the pharisees and some of the
scribes coming from jerusalem
and when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common
that is with unwashed hands they found fault
for the pharisees and all the jews eat not without often washing
their hands holding the tradition of the ancients
and when they come from the market unless they be washed they eat
not and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to
observe the washings of cups and of pots and of brazen vessels and of
beds
and the pharisees and scribes asked him why do not thy disciples
walk according to the tradition of the ancients but they eat bread with
common hands
but he answering said to them well did isaias prophesy of you
hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth me with their lips
but their heart is far from me
and in vain do they worship me teaching doctrines and precepts of
men
for leaving the commandment of god you hold the tradition of men
the washing of pots and of cups and many other things you do like to
these
and he said to them well do you make void the commandment of god
that you may keep your own tradition
for moses said honour thy father and thy mother and he that
shall curse father or mother dying let him die
but you say if a man shall say to his father or mother corban
which is a gift whatsoever is from me shall profit thee
and further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or
mother
making void the word of god by your own tradition which you have
given forth and many other such like things you do
and calling again the multitude unto him he said to them hear ye
me all and understand
there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can
defile him but the things which come from a man those are they that
defile a man
if any man have ears to hear let him hear
and when he was come into the house from the multitude his
disciples asked him the parable
and he saith to them so are you also without knowledge
cannot defile him
because it entereth not into his heart but goeth into his belly
and goeth out into the privy purging all meats
but he said that the things which come out from a man they defile
a man
for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts
adulteries fornications murders
thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil
eye blasphemy pride foolishness
all these evil things come from within and defile a man
and rising from thence he went into the coasts of tyre and sidon
and entering into a house he would that no man should know it and he
could not be hid
for a woman as soon as she heard of him whose daughter had an
unclean spirit came in and fell down at his feet
for the woman was a gentile a syrophenician born and she
besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter
who said to her suffer first the children to be filled for it is
not good to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs
but she answered and said to him yea lord for the whelps also
eat under the table of the crumbs of the children
and he said to her for this saying go thy way the devil is gone
out of thy daughter
and when she was come into her house she found the girl lying
upon the bed and that the devil was gone out
and again going out of the coasts of tyre he came by sidon to the
sea of galilee through the midst the of the coasts of decapolis
and they bring to him one deaf and dumb and they besought him
that he would lay his hand upon him
and taking him from the multitude apart he put his fingers into
his ears and spitting he touched his tongue
and looking up to heaven he groaned and said to him ephpheta
which is be thou opened
and immediately his ears were opened and the string of his tongue
was loosed and he spoke right
and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he
charged them so much the more a great deal did they publish it
and so much the more did they wonder saying he hath done all
things well he hath made both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak
his passion
in those days again when there was great multitude and they had
nothing to eat calling his disciples together he saith to them
i have compassion on the multitude for behold they have now been
with me three days and have nothing to eat
and if i shall send them away fasting to their home they will
faint in the way for some of them came from afar off
and his disciples answered him from whence can any one fill them
here with bread in the wilderness
and he asked them how many loaves have ye who said seven
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and taking
the seven loaves giving thanks he broke and gave to his disciples for
to set before them and they set them before the people
and they had a few little fishes and he blessed them and commanded
them to be set before them
and they did eat and were filled and they took up that which was
left of the fragments seven baskets
and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them
away
and immediately going up into a ship with his disciples he came
into the parts of dalmanutha
and the pharisees came forth and began to question with him
asking him a sign from heaven tempting him
and sighing deeply in spirit he saith why doth this generation
seek a sign amen i say to you a sign shall not be given to this
generation
and leaving them he went up again into the ship and passed to the
other side of the water
and they forgot to take bread and they had but one loaf with them
in the ship
and he charged them saying take heed and beware of the leaven of
the pharisees and of the leaven of herod
and they reasoned among themselves saying because we have no
bread
which jesus knowing saith to them why do you reason because you
have no bread do you not yet know nor understand have you still your
heart blinded
having eyes see you not and having ears hear you not neither
do you remember
when i broke the five loves among five thousand how many baskets
full of fragments took you up they say to him twelve
when also the seven loaves among four thousand how many baskets
of fragments took you up and they say to him seven
and he said to them how do you not yet understand
and they came to bethsaida and they bring to him a blind man and
they besought him that he would touch him
and taking the blind man by the hand he led him out of the town
saw any thing
and looking up he said i see men as it were trees walking
after that again he laid his hands upon his eyes and he began to
see and was restored so that he saw all things clearly
and he sent him into his house saying go into thy house and if
thou enter into the town tell nobody
and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea
do men say that i am
who answered him saying john the baptist but some elias and
others as one of the prophets
then he saith to them but whom do you say that i am peter
answering said to him thou art the christ
and he strictly charged them that they should not tell any man of
him
and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many
things and be rejected by the ancients and by the high priests and the
scribes and be killed and after three days rise again
and he spoke the word openly and peter taking him began to rebuke
him
who turning about and seeing his disciples threatened peter
saying go behind me satan because thou savourest not the things that
are of god but that are of men
and calling the multitude together with his disciples he said to
them if any man will follow me let him deny himself and take up his
cross and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever
shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel shall save it
for what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and
suffer the loss of his soul
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
for he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this
adulterous and sinful generation the son of man also will be ashamed of
him when he shall come in the glory of his father with the holy angels
and he said to them amen f say to you that there are some of them
that stand here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of
humility and to avoid scandal
and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john
and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and was
transfigured before them
and his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow so as
no fuller upon earth can make white
and there appeared to them elias with moses and they were talking
with jesus
and peter answering said to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be
here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for
for he knew not what he said for they were struck with fear
and there was a cloud overshadowing them and a voice came out of
the cloud saying this is my most beloved son hear ye him
and immediately looking about they saw no man any more but jesus
only with them
and as they came down from the mountain he charged them not to
tell any man what things they had seen till the son of man shall be
risen again from the dead
and they kept the word to themselves questioning together what
that should mean when he shall be risen from the dead
and they asked him saying why then do the pharisees and scribes
say that elias must come first
who answering said to then elias when he shall come first
shall restore all things and as it is written of the son of man that he
must suffer many things and be despised
but i say to you that elias also is come and they have done to
him whatsoever they would as it is written of him
and coming to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them
and the scribes disputing with them
and presently all the people seeing jesus were astonished and
struck with fear and running to him they saluted him
and he asked them what do you question about among you
and one of the multitude answering said master i have brought
my son to thee having a dumb spirit
who wheresoever he taketh him dasheth him and he foameth and
gnasheth with the teeth and pineth away and i spoke to thy disciples to
cast him out and they could not
who answering them said o incredulous generation how long shall
and they brought him and when he had seen him immediately the
spirit troubled him and being thrown down upon the ground he rolled
about foaming
and he asked his father how long time is it since this hath
happened unto him but he sad from his infancy
and oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into the waters
to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing help us having
compassion on us
and jesus saith to him if thou canst believe all things are
possible to him that believeth
and immediately the father of the boy crying out with tears said
and when jesus saw the multitude running together he threatened
the unclean spirit saying to him deaf and dumb spirit i command thee
go out of him and enter not any more into him
and crying out and greatly tearing him he went our of him and
he became as dead so that many said he is dead
but jesus taking him by the hand lifted him up and he arose
and when he was come into the house his disciples secretly asked
him why could not we cast him out
and he said to them this kind can go out by nothing but by
prayer and fasting
and departing from thence they passed through galilee and he
would not that any man should know it
and he taught his disciples and said to them the son of man shall
be betrayed into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after
that he is killed he shall rise again the third day
but they understood not the word and they were afraid to ask him
and they came to capharnaum and when they were in the house he
asked them what did you treat of in the way
but they held their peace for in the way they had disputed among
themselves which of them should be the greatest
and sitting down he called the twelve and saith to them if any
man desire to be first he shall be the last of all and be minister of
all
and taking a child he set him in the midst of them whom when he
had embraced he saith to them
whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name
receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him
that sent me
john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils
in thy name who followeth not us and we forbade him
but jesus said do not forbid him for there is no man that doth a
miracle in my name and can soon speak ill of me
for he that is not against you is for you
for whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in my name
because you belong to christ amen i say to you he shall not lose his
reward
and whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones that
believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about
his neck and he were cast into the sea
and if thy hand scandalize thee cut it off it is better for thee
to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into
unquenchable fire
where their worm dieth not and the fire is not extinguished
and if thy foot scandalize thee cut it off it is better for thee
to enter lame into life everlasting than having two feet to be cast into
the hell of unquenchable fire
where their worm dieth not and the fire is not extinguished
and if thy eye scandalize thee pluck it out it is better for
thee with one eye to enter into the kingdom of god than having two eyes
to be cast into the hell of fire
where their worm dieth not and the fire is not extinguished
for every one shall be salted with fire and every victim shall be
salted with salt
salt is good but if the salt become unsavoury wherewith will you
season it have salt in you and have peace among you
the sons of zebedee a blind man is restored to his sight
and rising up from thence he cometh into the coast of judea
beyond the jordan and the multitude flocked to him again and as he was
accustomed he taught them again
and the pharisees coming to him asked him tempting him is it
lawful for a man to put away his wife
but he answering saith to them what did moses command you
who said moses permitted to write a bill of divorce and to put
her away
to whom jesus answering said because of the hardness of your
heart he wrote you that precept
but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and
female
for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall
cleave to his wife
and they two shall be in one flesh therefore now they are not
two but one flesh
what therefore god hath joined together let no man put asunder
and in the house again his disciples asked him concerning the
same thing
and he saith to them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry
another committeth adultery against her
and if the wife shall put away her husband and be married to
another she committeth adultery
and they brought to him young children that he might touch them
whom when jesus saw he was much displeased and saith to them
such is the kingdom of god
amen i say to you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god
as a little child shall not enter into it
and embracing them and laying his hands upon them he blessed
them
and when he was gone forth into the way a certain man running
up and kneeling before him asked him good master what shall i do that
and jesus said to him why callest thou me good none is good but
one that is god
may be good also but only by participation of gods goodness
thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not
kill do not steal bear not false witness do no fraud honour thy
father and mother
but he answering said to him master all these things i have
observed from my youth
and jesus looking on him loved him and said to him one thing
is wanting unto thee go sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the
poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me
who being struck sad at that saying went away sorrowful for he
had great possessions
and jesus looking round about saith to his disciples how hardly
shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus again
answering saith to them children how hard is it for them that trust
in riches to enter into the kingdom of god
it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
who wondered the more saying among themselves who then can be
saved
and jesus looking on them saith with men it is impossible but
not with god for all things are possible with god
and peter began to say unto him behold we have left all things
and have followed thee
jesus answering said amen i say to you there is no man who hath
left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or children or
lands for my sake and for the gospel
who shall not receive an hundred times as much now in this time
houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with
persecutions and in the world to come life everlasting
but many that are first shall be last and the last first
and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus went
before them and they were astonished and following were afraid and
taking again the twelve he began to tell them the things that should
befall him
saying behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be
betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes and ancients and they
shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles
and they shall mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill
him and the third day he shall rise again
and james and john the sons of zebedee come to him saying
us
but he said to them what would you that i should do for you
and they said grant to us that we may sit one on thy right hand
and the other on thy left hand in thy glory
and jesus said to them you know not what you ask can you drink
of the chalice that i drink of or be baptized with the baptism wherewith
but they said to him we can and jesus saith to them you shall
indeed drink of the chalice that i drink of and with the baptism
wherewith i am baptized you shall be baptized
but to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give to
you but to them for whom it is prepared
and the ten hearing it began to be much displeased at james and
but jesus calling them saith to them you know that they who
seem to rule over the gentiles lord it over them and their princes have
power over them
but it is not so among you but whosoever will be greater shall
be your minister
and whosoever will be first among you shall be the servant of
all
for the son of man also is not come to be ministered unto but to
minister and to give his life a redemption for many
and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his
disciples and a very great multitude bartimeus the blind man the son
of timeus sat by the way side begging
who when he had heard that it was jesus of nazareth began to cry
out and to say jesus son of david have mercy on me
and many rebuked him that he might hold his peace but he cried
a great deal the more son of david have mercy on me
and jesus standing still commanded him to be called and they
call the blind man saying to him be of better comfort arise he
calleth thee
who casting off his garment leaped up and came to him
and jesus answering said to him what wilt thou that i should do
to thee and the blind man said to him rabboni that i may see
and jesus saith to him go thy way thy faith hath made thee
whole and immediately he saw and followed him in the way
and drives the buyers and sellers out of the temple
and when they were drawing near to jerusalem and to bethania at
the mount of olives he sendeth two of his disciples
and saith to them go into the village that is over against you
and immediately at your coming in thither you shall find a colt tied
upon which no man yet hath sat loose him and bring him
and if any man shall say to you what are you doing say ye that
the lord hath need of him and immediately he will let him come hither
and going their way they found the colt tied before the gate
without in the meeting of two ways and they loose him
and some of them that stood there said to them what do you
loosing the colt
who said to them as jesus had commanded them and they let him go
with them
and they brought the colt to jesus and they lay their garments on
him and he sat upon him
and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down
boughs from the trees and strewed them in the way
and they that went before and they that followed cried saying
blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh hosanna
in the highest
and he entered into jerusalem into the temple and having viewed
all things round about when now the eventide was come he went out to
and the next day when they came out from bethania he was hungry
and when he had seen afar off a fig tree having leaves he came
if perhaps he might find any thing on it and when he was come to it he
found nothing but leaves for it was not the time for figs
and answering he said to it may no man hereafter eat fruit of
thee any more for ever and his disciples heard it
and they came to jerusalem and when he was entered into the
temple he began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple
and over threw the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of them
that sold doves
and he suffered not that any man should carry a vessel through
the temple
and he taught saying to them is it not written my house shall
be called the house of prayer to all nations but you have made it a den
of thieves
which when the chief priests and the scribes had heard they
sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because the
whole multitude was in admiration at his doctrine
and when evening was come he went forth out of the city
and when they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree
dried up from the roots
and peter remembering said to him rabbi behold the fig tree
which thou didst curse is withered away
and jesus answering saith to them have the faith of god
amen i say to you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be
thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not stagger in his
heart but be believe that whatsoever he saith shall be done it shall
be done unto him
therefore i say unto you all things whatsoever you ask when ye
pray believe that you shall receive and they shall come unto you
and when you shall stand to pray forgive if you have aught
against any man that your father also who is in heaven may forgive
you your sins
but if you will not forgive neither will your father that is in
heaven forgive you your sins
and they come again to jerusalem and when he was walking in the
temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the
ancients
and they say to him by what authority dost thou these things
things
and jesus answering said to them i will also ask you one word
things
the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men answer me
but they thought with themselves saying if we say from heaven
he will say why then did you not believe him
if we say from men we fear the people for all men counted john
that he was a prophet indeed
and they answering say to jesus we know not and jesus
answering saith to them neither do i tell you by what authority i do
these things
and he began to speak to them in parables a certain man planted a
vineyard and made a hedge about it and dug a place for the winefat and
built a tower and let it to husbandmen and went into a far country
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive
of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard
who having laid hands on him beat and sent him away empty
and again he sent to them another servant and him they wounded in
the head and used him reproachfully
and again he sent another and him they killed and many others
of whom some they beat and others they killed
therefore having yet one son most dear to him he also sent him
unto them last of all saying they will reverence my son
but the husbandmen said one to another this is the heir come
let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours
and laying hold on him they killed him and cast him out of the
vineyard
what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do he will come and
destroy those husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others
and have you not read this scripture the stone which the
builders rejected the same is made the head of the corner
by the lord has this been done and it is wonderful in our eyes
and they sought to lay hands on him but they feared the people
went their way
and they sent to him some of the pharisees and of the herodians
that they should catch him in his words
who coming say to him master we know that thou art a true
speaker and carest not for any man for thou regardest not the person of
men but teachest the way of god in truth is it lawful to give tribute
to caesar or shall we not give it
who knowing their wiliness saith to them why tempt you me
and they brought it him and he saith to them whose is this
image and inscription they say to him caesars
and jesus answering said to them render therefore to caesar the
things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods and they
marvelled at him
and there came to him the sadducees who say there is no
resurrection and they asked him saying
master moses wrote unto us that if any mans brother die and
leave his wife behind him and leave no children his brother should take
his wife and raise up seed to his brother
now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and died
leaving no issue
and the second took her and died and neither did he leave any
issue and the third in like manner
and the seven all took her in like manner and did not leave
issue last of all the woman also died
in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise again whose
wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife
and jesus answering saith to them do ye not therefore err
because you know not the scriptures nor the power of god
for when they shall rise again from the dead they shall neither
marry nor be married but are as the angels in heaven
and as concerning the dead that they rise again have you not read
in the book of moses how in the bush god spoke to him saying i am the
he is not the god of the dead but of the living you therefore
do greatly err
and there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning
together and seeing that he had answered them well asked him which was
the first commandment of all
and jesus answered him the first commandment of all is hear o
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with thy whole heart and
with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind and with thy whole strength
and the second is like to it thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself there is no other commandment greater than these
and the scribe said to him well master thou hast said in truth
that there is one god and there is no other besides him
and that he should be loved with the whole heart and with the
whole understanding and with the whole soul and with the whole strength
holocausts and sacrifices
and jesus seeing that he had answered wisely said to him thou
art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that durst ask him
any question
and jesus answering said teaching in the temple how do the
scribes say that christ is the son of david
for david himself saith by the holy ghost the lord said to my
david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he then
his son and a great multitude heard him gladly
and he said to them in his doctrine beware of the scribes who
love to walk in long robes and to be saluted in the marketplace
and to sit in the first chairs in the synagogues and to have the
highest places at suppers
who devour the houses of widows under the pretence of long
prayer these shall receive greater judgment
and jesus sitting over against the treasury beheld how the
people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in
much
and there came a certain poor widow and she cast in two mites
which make a farthing
and calling his disciples together he saith to them amen i say
to you this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast
into the treasury
for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want
cast in all she had even her whole living
forerun the day of judgment
and as he was going out of the temple one of his disciples said
to him master behold what manner of stones and what buildings are
here
and jesus answering said to him seest thou all these great
buildings there shall not be left a stone upon a stone that shall not
be thrown down
and as he sat on the mount of olivet over against the temple
tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign
when all these things shall begin to be fulfilled
and jesus answering began to say to them take heed lest any man
deceive you
for many shall come in my name saying i am he and they shall
deceive many
and when you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars fear ye not
for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and famines these
things are the beginning of sorrows
but look to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils
and in the synagogues you shall be beaten and you shall stand before
governors and kings for my sake for a testimony unto them
and unto all nations the gospel must first be preached
and when they shall lead you and deliver you up be not
thoughtful beforehand what you shall speak but whatsoever shall be
given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not you that speak but
the holy ghost
and the brother shall betray his brother unto death and the
father his son and children shall rise up against their parents and
shall work their death
and you shall be hated by all men for my names sake but he that
shall endure unto the end he shall be saved
and when you shall see the abomination of desolation standing
where it ought not he that readeth let him understand then let them
that are in judea flee unto the mountains
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house
nor enter therein to take any thing out of the house
and let him that shall be in the field not turn back to take up
his garment
and woe to them that are with child and that give suck in those
days
but pray ye that these things happen not in winter
for in those days shall be such tribulations as were not from the
beginning of the creation which god created until now neither shall be
and unless the lord had shortened the days no flesh should be
saved but for the sake of the elect which he hath chosen he hath
shortened the days
and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ lo he
is here do not believe
for there will rise up false christs and false prophets and they
shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the
elect
take you heed therefore behold i have foretold you all things
but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be
darkened and the moon shall not give her light
and the stars of heaven shall be falling down and the powers that
are in heaven shall be moved
and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with
great power and glory
and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his
elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the
uttermost part of heaven
now of the fig tree learn ye a parable when the branch thereof
is now tender and the leaves are come forth you know that summer is
very near
so you also when you shall see these things come to pass know ye
that it is very nigh even at the doors
amen i say to you that this generation shall not pass until all
these things be done
heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass
away
but of that day or hour no man knoweth neither the angels in
heaven nor the son but the father
of judgment but that he knoweth it not as our teacher that is he
knoweth it not so as to teach it to us as not being expedient
take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is
even as a man who going into a far country left his house and
gave authority to his servants over every work and commanded the porter
to watch
watch ye therefore for you know not when the lord of the house
cometh at even or at midnight or at the cock crowing or in the
morning
lest coming on a sudden he find you sleeping
and what i say to you i say to all watch
now the feast of the pasch and of the azymes was after two days
and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile
lay hold on him and kill him
but they said not on the festival day lest there should be a
tumult among the people
and when he was in bethania in the house of simon the leper and
was at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of
precious spikenard and breaking the alabaster box she poured it out
upon his head
now there were some that had indignation within themselves and
said why was this waste of the ointment made
for this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred
pence and given to the poor and they murmured against her
but jesus said let her alone why do you molest her she hath
wrought a good work upon me
for the poor you have always with you and whensoever you will
you may do them good but me you have not always
she hath done what she could she is come beforehand to anoint my
body for the burial
amen i say to you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in
the whole world that also which she hath done shall be told for a
memorial of her
and judas iscariot one of the twelve went to the chief priests
to betray him to them
who hearing it were glad and they promised him they would give
him money and he sought how he might conveniently betray him
now on the first day of the unleavened bread when they
sacrificed the pasch the disciples say to him whither wilt thou that
we go and prepare for thee to eat the pasch
and he sendeth two of his disciples and saith to them go ye into
the city and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water
and whithersoever he shall go in say to the master of the house
my disciples
and he will shew you a large dining room furnished and there
prepare ye for us
and his disciples went their way and came into the city and
they found as he had told them and they prepared the pasch
and when evening was come he cometh with the twelve
and when they were at table and eating jesus saith amen i say
to you one of you that eateth with me shall betray me
but they began to be sorrowful and to say to him one by one is
it i
who saith to them one of the twelve who dippeth with me his
hand in the dish
and the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe
to that man by whom the son of man shall be betrayed it were better
for him if that man had not been born
and whilst they were eating jesus took bread and blessing
broke and gave to them and said take ye this is my body
and having taken the chalice giving thanks he gave it to them
and he said to them this is my blood of the new testament which
shall be shed for many
amen i say to you that i will drink no more of the fruit of the
vine until that day when i shall drink it new in the kingdom of god
and when they had sung an hymn they went forth to the mount of
and jesus saith to them you will all be scandalized in my regard
this night for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep
shall be dispersed
but after i shall be risen again i will go before you into
but peter saith to him although all shall be scandalized in
thee yet not i
and jesus saith to him amen i say to thee today even in this
night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice
about midnight for the first time and then about the time commonly
called the cock crowing and this was the cock crowing our saviour spoke
of and therefore the other evangelists take no notice of the first
crowing
but he spoke the more vehemently although i should die together
with thee i will not deny thee and in like manner also said they all
and they came to a farm called gethsemani and he saith to his
disciples sit you here while i pray
and he taketh peter and james and john with him and he began to
fear and to be heavy
and he saith to them my soul is sorrowful even unto death stay
you here and watch
and when he was gone forward a little he fell flat on the
ground and he prayed that if it might be the hour might pass from
him
and he saith abba father all things are possible to thee
remove this chalice from me but not what i will but what thou wilt
and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and he saith to peter
watch ye and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit
indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
and going away again he prayed saying the same words
and when he returned he found them again asleep for their eyes
were heavy and they knew not what to answer him
and he cometh the third time and saith to them sleep ye now and
take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man
shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners
rise up let us go behold he that will betray me is at hand
and while he was yet speaking cometh judas iscariot one of the
twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the
chief priests and the scribes and the ancients
and he that betrayed him had given them a sign saying
carefully
and when he was come immediately going up to him he saith hail
but they laid hands on him and held him
and one of them that stood by drawing a sword struck a servant
of the chief priest and cut off his ear
and jesus answering said to them are you come out as to a
robber with swords and staves to apprehend me
i was daily with you in the temple teaching and you did not lay
hands on me but that the scriptures may be fulfilled
then his disciples leaving him all fled away
and a certain young man followed him having a linen cloth cast
about his naked body and they laid hold on him
but he casting off the linen cloth fled from them naked
and they brought jesus to the high priest and all the priests
and the scribes and the ancients assembled together
and peter followed him afar off even into the court of the high
priest and he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself
and the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence
against jesus that they might put him to death and found none
for many bore false witness against him and their evidences were
not agreeing
and some rising up bore false witness against him saying
we heard him say i will destroy this temple made with hands and
within three days i will build another not made with hands
and their witness did not agree
and the high priest rising up in the midst asked jesus saying
these men
but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest
asked him and said to him art thou the christ the son of the blessed
and jesus said to him i am and you shall see the son of man
sitting on the right hand of the power of god and coming with the clouds
of heaven
then the high priest rending his garments saith what need we
any further witnesses
you have heard the blasphemy what think you who all condemned
him to be guilty of death
and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet
him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants struck him with the
palms their hands
now when peter was in the court below there cometh one of the
maidservants of the high priest
and when she had seen peter warming himself looking on him she
saith thou also wast with jesus of nazareth
but he denied saying i neither know nor understand what thou
sayest and he went forth before the court and the cock crew
and again a maidservant seeing him began to say to the standers
by this is one of them
but he denied again and after a while they that stood by said
again to peter surely thou art one of them for thou art also a
but he began o curse and to swear saying i know not this man of
whom you speak
and immediately the cock crew again and peter remembered the
word that jesus had said unto him before the cock crow twice thou
shalt thrice deny me and he began to weep
and straightway in the morning the chief priests holding a
consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council
binding jesus led him away and delivered him to pilate
and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews but he
answering saith to him thou sayest it
and the chief priests accused him in many things
and pilate again asked him saying answerest thou nothing
but jesus still answered nothing so that pilate wondered
now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of
the prisoners whomsoever they demanded
and there was one called barabbas who was put in prison with some
seditious men who in the sedition had committed murder
and when the multitude was come up they began to desire that he
would do as he had ever done unto them
and pilate answered them and said will you that i release to you
the king of the jews
for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of
envy
but the chief priests moved the people that he should rather
release barabbas to them
and pilate again answering saith to them what will you then
that i do to the king of the jews
but they again cried out crucify him
and pilate saith to them why what evil hath he done but they
cried out the more crucify him
and so pilate being willing to satisfy the people released to
them barabbas and delivered up jesus when he had scourged him to be
crucified
and the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace and
they called together the whole band
and they clothed him with purple and platting a crown of
thorns they put it upon him
and they began to salute him hail king of the jews
and they struck his head with a reed and they did spit on him
and after they had mocked him they took off the purple from him
and put his own garments on him and they led him out to crucify him
and they forced one simon a cyrenian who passed by coming out of
the country the father of alexander and of rufus to take up his cross
and they bring him into the place called golgotha which being
interpreted is the place of calvary
and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he took
it not
and crucifying him they divided his garments casting lots upon
them what every man should take
and it was the third hour and they crucified him
which were named from the hour from which they began the first third
sixth and ninth hour our lord was crucified a little before noon
before the third hour had quite expired but when the sixth hour was
near at hand
and the inscription of his cause was written over the king of
and with him they crucify two thieves the one on his right hand
and the other on his left
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and with the wicked
he was reputed
and they that passed by blasphemed him wagging their heads and
saying vah thou that destroyest the temple of god and in three days
buildest it up again
save thyself coming down from the cross
in like manner also the chief priests mocking said with the
scribes one to another he saved others himself he cannot save
let christ the king of israel come down now from the cross that
we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviled
him
and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the
whole earth until the ninth hour
and at the ninth hour jesus cried out with a loud voice saying
and some of the standers by hearing said behold he calleth
and one running and filling a sponge with vinegar and putting it
upon a reed gave him to drink saying stay let us see if elias come
to take him down
and jesus having cried out with a loud voice gave up the ghost
and the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the
bottom
and the centurion who stood over against him seeing that crying
out in this manner he had given up the ghost said indeed this man was
the son of god
and there were also women looking on afar off among whom was
who also when he was in galilee followed him and ministered to
him and many other women that came up with him to jerusalem
and when evening was now come because it was the parasceve that
is the day before the sabbath
joseph of arimathea a noble counsellor who was also himself
looking for the kingdom of god came and went in boldly to pilate and
begged the body of jesus
but pilate wondered that he should be already dead and sending
for the centurion he asked him if he were already dead
and when he had understood it by the centurion he gave the body
to joseph
and joseph buying fine linen and taking him down wrapped him up
in the fine linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a
rock and he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre
and mary magdalen and mary the mother of joseph beheld where he
was laid
and when the sabbath was past mary magdalen and mary the mother
of james and salome bought sweet spices that coming they might anoint
and very early in the morning the first day of the week they
come to the sepulchre the sun being now risen
the sepulchre but the sun was risen when they arrived there or
figuratively the sun here spoken of is the sun of justice christ jesus
our lord who was risen before their coming
and they said one to another who shall roll us back the stone
from the door of the sepulchre
and looking they saw the stone rolled back for it was very
great
and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on
the right side clothed with a white robe and they were astonished
who saith to them be not affrighted you seek jesus of nazareth
who was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where
they laid him
but go tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into
but they going out fled from the sepulchre for a trembling and
fear had seized them and they said nothing to any man for they were
afraid
but he rising early the first day of the week appeared first to
she went and told them that had been with him who were mourning
and weeping
and they hearing that he was alive and had been seen by her did
not believe
and after that he appeared in another shape to two of them
walking as they were going into the country
and they going told it to the rest neither did they believe
them
at length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table and he
upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart because
they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again
and he said to them go ye into the whole world and preach the
gospel to every creature
he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that
believeth not shall he condemned
and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they
shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues
they shall take up serpents and if they shall drink any deadly
thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay their hand upon the sick
and they shall recover
and the lord jesus after he had spoken to them was taken up
into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of god
but they going forth preached every where the lord working
withal and confirming the word with signs that followed
profession a physician and some ancient writers say that he was very
skillful in painting he was converted by st paul and became his
disciple and companion in his travels and fellowlabourer in the
ministry of the gospel he wrote in greek about twentyfour years after
our lords ascension
