beware of heretics
jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them
that are beloved in god the father and preserved in jesus christ and
called
mercy unto you and peace and charity be fulfilled
dearly beloved taking all care to write unto you concerning your
common salvation i was under a necessity to write unto you to beseech
you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints
for certain men are secretly entered in who were written of long
ago unto this judgment ungodly men turning the grace of our lord god
into riotousness and denying the only sovereign ruler and our lord jesus
i will therefore admonish you though ye once knew all things that
destroy them that believed not
and the angels who kept not their principality but forsook their
own habitation he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains
unto the judgment of the great day
their original dignity
as sodom and gomorrha and the neighbouring cities in like manner
having given themselves to fornication and going after other flesh were
made an example suffering the punishment of eternal fire
in like manner these men also defile the flesh and despise
dominion and blaspheme majesty
utter blasphemies against the divine majesty
when michael the archangel disputing with the devil contended
about the body of moses he durst not bring against him the judgment of
railing speech but said the lord command thee
mentioned in holy writ was originally known by revelation and
transmitted by tradition it is thought the occasion of it was that the
devil would have had the body buried in such a place and manner as to
be worshipped by the jews with divine honours command thee or rebuke
thee
but these men blaspheme whatever things they know not and what
things soever they naturally know like dumb beasts in these they are
corrupted
woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and after
the error of balaam they have for reward poured out themselves and have
perished in the contradiction of core
the souls of their brethren the way of balaam by putting a scantal
before the people of god for their own private ends and the way of
appointment
these are spots in their banquets feasting together without fear
feeding themselves clouds without water which are carried about by
winds trees of the autumn unfruitful twice dead plucked up by the
roots
raging waves of the sea foaming out their own confusion
wandering stars to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever
now of these enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied
saying behold the lord cometh with thousands of his saints
book that is since lost
to execute judgment upon all and to reprove all the ungodly for
all the works of their ungodliness whereby they have done ungodly and
for all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against god
these are murmurers full of complaints walking according to
their own desires and their mouth speaketh proud things admiring
persons for gains sake
but you my dearly beloved be mindful of the words which have
been spoken before by the apostles of our lord jesus christ
faithful to remain steadfast in the belief and practice of what they had
heard from the apostles who had also foretold that in aftertimes lit
in the last time there should be false teachers scoffing and
ridiculing all revealed truths abandoning themselves to their passions
and lusts who separate themselves from the catholic communion by
heresies and schisms sensual men carried away and enslaved by the
pleasures of the senses
who told you that in the last time there should come mockers
walking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses
these are they who separate themselves sensual men having not
the spirit
but you my beloved building yourselves upon your most holy
faith praying in the holy ghost
keep yourselves in the love of god waiting for the mercy of our
actions a spiritual building founded st upon faith d on the love
of god d upon hope whilst you are waiting for the mercies of god
and the reward of eternal life th joined with the great duty of
prayer
and some indeed reprove being judged
but others save pulling them out of the fire and on others have
mercy in fear hating also the spotted garment which is carnal
to practice charity in endeavouring to convert their neighbour where
they will meet with three sorts of persons st with persons obstinate
in their errors and sins these may be said to be already judged and
condemned they are to be sharply reprehended reproved and if possible
convinced of their error d as to others you must endeavour to save
them by pulling them as it were out of the fire from the ruin they
stand in great danger of d you must have mercy on others in fear
when you see them through ignorance of frailty in danger of being drawn
into the snares of these heretics with these you must deal more gently
and mildly with a charitable compassion hating always and teaching
others to hate the carnal garment which is spotted their sensual and
corrupt manners that defile both the soul and body
now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present
you spotless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy in the
coming of our lord jesus christ
to the only god our saviour through jesus christ our lord be
glory and magnificence empire and power before all ages and now and
for all ages of ages amen
praising god and praying to the only god our saviour which may either
signify god the father or god as equally agreeing to all the three
persons who are equally the cause of christs incarnation and mans
salvation through jesus christ our lord who being god from eternity
took upon him our human nature that he might become our redeemer
instructions and admonitions which st john was commanded to write to
the seven bishops of the churches in asia and in the following
chapters to the end are contained prophecies of things that are to
come to pass in the church of christ particularly towards the end of
the world in the time of antichrist it was written in greek in the
island of patmos where st john was in banishment by order of the cruel
emperor domitian about sixtyfour years after our lords ascension
